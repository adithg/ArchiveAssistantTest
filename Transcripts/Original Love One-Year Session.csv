246.300,248.800," we'll begin with with sitting"
249.900,252.600," I want to actually just let you know that I have this"
253.100,253.700," precious little"
255.000,256.600," piece of white marble with me"
257.100,258.700," this comes from Poland and"
259.400,261.600," I mentioned that in a session recently"
262.700,265.400," and I'll be speaking to it just a little bit more"
266.500,268.400," in the clothes of our session today"
270.800,271.400," so let's"
272.000,273.300," find our way"
274.700,274.900," to"
276.300,276.700," balance"
277.400,278.700," that's where we begin"
279.200,280.000," any adjustments"
280.800,281.600," you need to make"
283.000,285.700," you make you may be having balance because you're"
286.400,287.400," you're leaning back"
287.700,287.700," so"
288.500,290.800," the weight of your body and gravity is action on it"
291.300,292.800," is balanced with the support"
293.800,297.200," that's holding you up all of us will be getting that kind of balance"
298.300,299.900," through the support beneath us"
301.200,302.400," and then the other kind of"
302.900,305.600," the other kind of balance is for those of us sitting"
306.500,308.600," with a free spine"
309.500,311.300," with a back that's unsupported"
313.200,315.000," so just a little bit here for"
316.300,317.900," for those of us sitting like that"
319.900,320.300," try"
321.700,326.500," doing a few gentle rocking motions backwards and forwards really slight"
328.400,328.500," the"
329.700,331.200," it could be just a couple of inches"
332.500,333.300," back and forth"
334.800,337.500," and what we want to be doing is feeling the seat"
338.500,339.600," as we're doing that"
341.100,343.200," and checking that the spine is fairly"
344.100,346.400," sort of erect it's fairly upright"
348.500,348.600," and"
350.200,352.300," the the invitation or the the"
354.300,354.800," kind of"
355.700,356.500," focus point"
357.000,358.000," here can be"
359.000,359.800," sensing"
361.100,362.900," the balanced zone"
363.200,366.000," as you go backwards and forwards so"
366.900,368.900," there's a little kind of hump somewhere"
369.500,370.400," a little brow"
371.600,373.800," and you want to be resting on that brow"
375.500,376.100," where the"
377.400,378.900," where the plum line is"
380.800,383.800," I always think it's actually less of a line"
384.700,385.800," more of a little zone"
387.100,387.700," an area"
389.500,391.200," where the balance is okay"
393.100,394.300," so the crown of the head"
396.900,399.700," this can be for all of us the crown of the head is like a"
400.800,402.300," like a little smoke ring"
403.900,404.300," bloating"
405.500,406.100," up there"
407.400,408.300," above the seat"
413.900,415.000," let the head"
416.300,417.200," tilt forward"
418.400,420.600," about one degree out of 90"
421.500,422.600," just a hair"
423.900,425.200," of a forward tilt"
427.600,429.900," so the Chin is coming in"
430.900,433.700," just a millimetre or two"
434.800,435.800," towards the"
436.800,437.200," throat"
441.800,443.900," and with that movement and with the"
445.200,448.000," tiny teeny tiny tilt to the head"
449.100,450.200," the back of the neck"
453.100,453.500," might"
453.900,456.700," just extend a tiny bit"
458.300,459.900," and also kind of open up"
461.300,461.800," so we're"
462.400,463.200," we're resting"
464.600,464.900," with"
470.200,470.900," the throat"
471.400,471.700," soft"
474.200,477.200," the chin just a wee bit closer to the throat"
479.800,480.900," and the back of the neck"
482.200,483.900," just a little bit longer"
486.200,487.600," just a little bit longer"
494.100,494.700," okay- lovely"
501.300,502.600," just resting like that"
505.800,506.400," but now"
508.700,509.700," release the jaw"
511.600,512.900," that the joggers Slack"
517.700,519.600," and feel the ease of that"
520.200,520.900," blackness"
522.500,524.200," perhaps in the sides of the neck"
526.700,528.900," perhaps in the shoulders and arms"
530.300,531.500," Arms dangling"
535.400,537.200," that softness"
538.400,540.700," to whatever extent your tasting it let it"
541.300,542.000," migrate"
543.600,544.300," or sort of"
544.600,546.400," blow down into the chest"
547.700,548.300," warming it"
549.700,550.800," through the diaphragm"
553.900,557.600," and he's blowing down through the diaphragm into the belly"
559.200,561.000," and right into the seat"
563.900,564.900," grounding us"
566.800,567.900," bringing us into that"
568.700,570.500," sort of blessed rest"
572.200,573.100," of meditation"
576.100,577.900," and then on down through the legs"
579.000,580.000," and into the feet"
582.300,583.000," where"
583.600,584.300," we're here"
587.300,587.900," we're here"
623.200,623.900," we can now"
624.900,626.900," turn our inward gaze"
628.100,628.900," to the area"
629.800,631.100," right beneath the nose"
632.900,634.100," so what are between the"
634.600,636.400," nostrils and the top lip"
642.100,644.800," and we simply start to sense"
646.300,648.100," the movement of the breast"
649.300,650.100," right there"
652.500,653.400," blowing in"
654.300,654.900," blowing out"
670.500,674.300," and actually that's the extent of our effort"
676.800,677.600," our effort"
678.800,679.900," is no more than"
681.400,682.400," watching the breath"
683.800,684.600," do it's thing"
702.200,704.700," so then the invitation becomes how"
705.600,706.500," effortless"
707.900,708.500," can it be"
723.000,725.300," how effortless can it be"
727.100,729.300," to basically receive"
731.600,733.900," the back and forth flow of the breadth"
736.000,738.600," at the nostrils or just beneath them"
753.800,754.300," it"
763.200,763.700," if you"
765.100,765.800," if you already"
766.300,767.900," set sail as it were in a"
768.600,771.000," sort of sailing sweet major just carry on"
772.200,772.300," and"
773.800,775.300," I will be giving a few little"
776.500,778.600," invitations pointers that"
780.100,782.000," may help us find"
783.400,784.900," ever deeper he's"
786.100,788.500," and calm and effortlessness"
790.500,790.900," while"
792.500,793.600," lightly tracking"
794.100,794.600," the breath"
807.900,811.700," let your awareness now include your seat"
814.900,816.500,"feel that support"
818.500,819.500," this holding you up"
821.400,822.400," as holding you"
829.300,829.800," feeling"
840.300,842.400," and now also feel"
843.600,844.100," the body"
845.800,848.000," that's being supported by the seat"
850.000,850.700," feel the"
850.900,852.200," the body field"
854.700,856.200," it might sometimes be"
857.600,858.600," a bit like a"
859.700,861.200," kind of like an egg shape"
862.700,863.800," the whole upper body"
865.600,867.700," almost like an egg resting Hunter"
868.500,868.900," on a little"
869.700,870.900," egg cup kind of thing"
872.300,872.700," yeah"
873.300,874.300," body resting"
875.400,875.700," on its"
876.100,876.600," seat"
897.800,898.500," no well"
899.100,900.200," sensing"
901.500,903.200," the body as a kind of space"
912.900,913.800," of volume"
921.700,924.500," cloud of subtle Sensation"
942.200,942.800," and let"
944.600,946.000," our part of that cloud"
946.700,946.900," B"
948.700,950.500," the area right under the nose"
958.800,961.000," and let part of it also be the"
962.700,965.100," the kind of feather-like stroke"
966.200,966.900," of the breath"
969.100,969.900," back and forth"
971.700,972.500," right there"
974.000,975.100," above the mouth"
1037.700,1039.600," and you rest with the"
1040.600,1042.900," Field of body sensations"
1045.800,1047.100," including"
1048.600,1049.800," the movement of the"
1051.900,1052.500," bright at the"
1053.200,1055.300," nostrils or just beneath them"
1059.900,1061.700," is there a way that"
1062.500,1065.700," rhythmic rhythmic flow of the bread"
1067.600,1067.900," might"
1068.200,1070.800," bring its own kind of he's"
1072.000,1072.700," and rest"
1074.400,1075.200," into the body"
1120.600,1123.000," that's see if we can use the"
1123.900,1125.700," micro effort"
1126.400,1127.100," of watching the"
1130.400,1131.500," breath to bring on"
1133.700,1134.400," a deep"
1135.600,1136.800," effortlessness"
1138.500,1139.100," in the body"
1141.300,1142.600," in the sense of the body"
1201.700,1203.700," resting with the breath"
1208.900,1209.900," resting"
1210.900,1211.800," in the body"
1265.500,1266.100," for sure"
1267.200,1267.900," that time"
1269.200,1270.800," thoughts may come up"
1272.500,1274.400," anytime we notice they have"
1276.000,1277.000," we thank them"
1279.400,1281.400," we thank ourselves for"
1282.700,1283.700," being present"
1285.000,1286.400," doing the meditation"
1288.300,1288.700," we"
1290.400,1290.700," check"
1293.500,1297.500," we just sort of acknowledge what the last thought was about"
1300.400,1300.700," and"
1301.700,1302.800," put it on the shelf"
1305.700,1306.800," and we come back"
1309.900,1310.300," to breathe"
1312.200,1312.500," body"
1320.800,1323.000," you can use usually slip right back in"
1331.800,1334.300," take this on as a little study"
1335.300,1336.700," a little experiment"
1339.800,1340.700," can the"
1341.900,1343.100," micro effort"
1344.400,1345.700," of watching the breath"
1347.900,1349.000," subtly"
1349.700,1350.600," induce"
1352.600,1353.700," effortlessness"
1355.700,1356.300," in the body"
1427.100,1428.800," just the note that"
1430.200,1433.000," it's okay if the breath becomes"
1433.800,1434.800," very slight"
1437.400,1438.800," very subtle"
1442.700,1443.600," quite slow"
1445.500,1446.200," that's fine"
1467.000,1468.800," because it's also fine"
1469.800,1471.500," if it's a little stronger"
1473.300,1473.900," a problem"
1482.200,1484.100," and yes it's fine if I"
1484.800,1487.200," attention Wonder's at times of course"
1573.000,1574.000,"resting"
1575.300,1576.500," and receiving"
1577.900,1578.200," this"
1578.700,1579.400," subtle"
1581.100,1581.600," gift"
1582.200,1582.900," of the breath"
1585.000,1585.800," subtle and"
1586.700,1587.100," this"
1695.400,1696.000,"nothing"
1696.600,1696.800," but"
1697.800,1698.600," this breath"
1704.500,1705.100," nothing"
1705.500,1706.100," but this"
1707.400,1708.400," experience"
1709.800,1710.200," now"
1804.800,1807.200," if you can just stay with"
1808.400,1809.700," a subtle"
1811.300,1812.700," motions of the"
1814.800,1815.900," breath beneath the nose"
1827.100,1828.000," and basically"
1829.400,1831.000," let them be nothing else"
1850.700,1851.600," just breathe"
1899.200,1900.200,"what is this"
1905.400,1906.600," who is this"
1907.200,1907.800," breathing"
1913.900,1915.500," what is this breathing"
1933.900,1936.200," and try to answer the questions"
1938.400,1939.100," just let them"
1942.100,1944.500," fertilize your meditation if they do"
1946.000,1947.400," find to ignore them as well"
1953.800,1954.300," oh"
1955.300,1956.300," his prais"
1977.800,1979.000," could it be the"
1979.900,1980.600," breasts"
1980.900,1982.500," breathes itself"
2090.500,2093.200," bring a subtle half smile"
2093.800,2094.700," into your face"
2102.400,2103.700," smile at the"
2123.000,2123.900,"absence"
2124.800,2126.000," a gratitude for"
2129.400,2129.900," it as the"
2131.400,2133.000," really the heart of our life"
2174.800,2176.400," resting and smiling"
2177.400,2178.200," with the breath"
2187.800,2188.100," and"
2189.100,2189.800," you know if"
2190.500,2192.100," you if you're sort of cruising"
2192.900,2195.600," and would like to just carry on do so of course"
2197.000,2198.800," but anybody who's ready"
2199.100,2200.200," for a"
2200.600,2201.100," pause"
2202.300,2205.700," we're going to have a Pause actually we're having a little break now"
2207.000,2208.700," and we'll reconvene at"
2210.000,2213.100," 45 minutes past the hour in 8 minutes time"
2213.900,2214.600," thank you all very much"
2215.600,2216.300," see you shortly"
2633.300,2635.200," well welcome welcome back everybody"
2636.100,2638.000," I hope you had a good set"
2638.800,2640.300," it sounds like a"
2641.000,2643.000," at least some some chats indicated"
2643.700,2646.000," that there was some some peace was found"
2646.800,2647.400," in that sit"
2649.100,2652.100," let's see I'm want to just give you a little"
2653.000,2653.300," kind of"
2654.400,2656.900," map of of the what I hope I'm going to be"
2657.500,2658.600," you know sharing myself"
2660.200,2661.400," for the next half hour or so"
2661.600,2661.900," um"
2664.300,2669.800," I want to consider what I've been considering really what this matter of effort and no effort"
2670.700,2670.900," and"
2672.000,2673.500," different perspectives on it"
2674.000,2676.900," but actually even prior to get into that"
2677.700,2680.400," we've got to also be clear on what is the"
2681.200,2682.300," what's the problem"
2683.700,2685.000," or what problems"
2685.600,2688.600," is practice for why practice at all"
2689.600,2690.700," you know because there's this"
2691.500,2695.000," you know here we are gathering like this we have yeah well"
2696.400,2698.700," by week by week is that the right way to put"
2699.200,2701.100," every every couple of weeks more or less"
2701.500,2705.100," and we gather to do this thing together of practising and I know"
2705.600,2706.900," many of you sit every day"
2708.200,2713.400," and we may perceive you know lovely benefits from it turns of just being in a"
2713.900,2715.800," karma more peaceful more appreciative"
2716.600,2716.800," less"
2717.500,2720.000," stressed out state and all of that that might be good"
2721.900,2723.000," but you know the"
2724.500,2729.200," the Old traditions feel that there's more really that practice is for"
2730.000,2731.300," and there's kind of a deeper"
2732.200,2732.400," probably"
2732.900,2733.400," so to speak"
2734.500,2735.400," and we're going to"
2736.200,2737.900," I want to I want to think about that a bit"
2738.700,2740.200," and before we get to"
2741.200,2742.000," you know the"
2742.700,2745.200," different ways that a sense of effort"
2746.500,2749.800," or at least some kind of efforts some sort of eff"
2750.400,2751.800," maybe part of practice"
2752.700,2753.800," and also ways in which"
2754.900,2755.700," no effort"
2756.700,2757.100," is a"
2757.600,2759.600," I'd say any even more important"
2760.100,2760.800," part of practice"
2762.400,2763.500," perhaps some would say"
2764.000,2765.300," the practice sort of is"
2766.100,2766.700," no effort"
2767.300,2767.600," actually"
2768.300,2769.100," and we get to"
2771.000,2773.500," really kind of starting to embody practice"
2774.200,2775.800," it's all about no effort"
2776.600,2777.900," that's really in a way perhaps"
2778.400,2780.200," even what practice actually is"
2780.800,2781.300," a bottom"
2781.800,2783.500," it's actually the part of no effort"
2784.000,2785.500," but there might be a part of effort"
2786.000,2787.400," to get to the path of no effort"
2788.100,2792.500," so this sort of see we may have to be constantly doing Close adjustment course correction"
2793.100,2794.700," man I've been enjoying this no effort"
2795.000,2796.000," oh wait hold on"
2796.500,2798.200," I'm actually a little bit off track somehow"
2798.500,2801.300," I got off the track of no effort so a little effort"
2802.200,2805.900," needed to get back to no efforts something like that you know well"
2806.200,2806.500," we'll see"
2807.800,2809.900," but actually first of all when I want to do is"
2810.500,2811.600," is this"
2812.000,2812.700," I want to do this"
2815.800,2817.100," I hope you can"
2817.600,2820.300," see that clearly that is a this is a photograph"
2821.200,2823.500," and the field of White"
2824.200,2824.900," marble"
2825.800,2826.500," rubble"
2827.500,2830.400," rubble made of my white marble"
2831.100,2831.700," okay so"
2832.200,2836.400," those of you who were here at the session I think probably most of you were"
2836.900,2837.800," when I spoke about"
2839.600,2846.200," getting extraordinary gift from Poland and I don't know if from from zen on who's actually in the sangre I'm not sure if he's"
2846.500,2848.000," here today but he's um"
2848.800,2850.600," a remarkable guy a poet and"
2851.400,2853.500," the Deep practitioner and a very generous man"
2854.100,2855.100," and he sent me this"
2855.500,2858.000," this is just a recap in case for those of you heard it before"
2859.100,2860.300," fresh material for those who haven't"
2860.700,2863.500," then all set me a package that contains some photographs"
2863.900,2865.800," one of which was this this one I just showed you"
2866.200,2868.200," the Field of white marble"
2868.600,2869.100," rubble"
2869.900,2872.800," and at that white marble is a"
2873.400,2877.000," memorial at one of the concentration camps in Poland"
2877.600,2880.900," and you know I'm this is a little bit personal but you know"
2881.700,2883.900," quite a number of my relatives"
2884.800,2886.000," who I never knew you know"
2886.700,2888.100," before long before I was born"
2888.500,2889.500," died in that camp"
2890.200,2893.100," and then on very very kindly went there and photographed it"
2893.500,2895.700," and also in this package he sent me"
2896.400,2898.000," this little white Stone"
2898.900,2900.200," which is a piece of marble"
2901.100,2902.200," white marble from there"
2903.100,2904.200," and I didn't"
2905.300,2907.400," I don't know if it's really supposed to but"
2908.000,2911.300," thank you very much anyway it's been very meaningful gift and"
2911.900,2913.000," so I want to start with"
2913.800,2915.200," a poem"
2915.800,2916.600," that came"
2919.300,2922.400," soon after the gift I you know it's a very new poem so"
2923.100,2924.200," it hasn't had my"
2925.000,2926.100," customer fussing"
2926.900,2928.200," over it for a couple of years"
2929.500,2930.900," so may not be very good but"
2931.800,2932.800," I'm going to share it anyway"
2933.600,2936.200," a friend is called a stone from Poland"
2936.600,2939.000," a stone from Poland a friend sent me a stone"
2939.800,2940.700," from Poland"
2941.500,2943.700," in a little golden sack"
2944.500,2946.000," with a pool lace"
2946.800,2947.400," a simple"
2948.000,2948.300," white"
2949.200,2949.800," Stone"
2951.700,2954.600," before I even opened the bag"
2955.500,2956.700," something in me"
2957.400,2958.300," knew what it was"
2959.800,2960.200," already"
2960.700,2962.200," my face went hot"
2963.200,2964.500," and my body filled"
2965.500,2966.100," with a shiver"
2967.000,2967.500," of Grace"
2969.900,2971.600," it was my ancestors come"
2972.100,2972.500," to visit"
2974.000,2974.300," bringing"
2975.100,2975.700," their children"
2979.900,2981.200," all the children"
2981.800,2982.800," who had no chance"
2984.000,2985.100," who lived a little while"
2986.000,2986.700," then wilted"
2987.700,2989.000," in the underground"
2989.600,2990.600," as flowers will"
2991.500,2993.000," when their season is over"
2994.600,2995.300," here they were"
2996.100,2997.000," come to visit me"
2998.000,2999.200," with their flowers"
3000.100,3001.600," the ones they ran through"
3002.500,3003.200," with their little"
3005.200,3006.800," with their little naked legs"
3007.700,3009.000," during the short- summer"
3010.100,3011.100," that was theirs"
3013.200,3014.400," finally they had come"
3015.300,3016.300," with this gift"
3016.900,3018.200," of the one white Stone"
3019.300,3019.900," in his little"
3020.300,3021.200," golden bag"
3022.300,3023.300," that only now"
3024.100,3024.700," do I draw"
3025.500,3025.900," out"
3027.800,3028.300," yes"
3029.600,3030.600," I want to tell them"
3031.700,3032.500," I have it"
3034.300,3034.700," thank you"
3036.100,3037.300," I am holding you"
3038.600,3039.400," and I see you"
3043.600,3045.900," and I see you running through"
3046.700,3047.400," your Fields"
3047.700,3048.300," of flowers"
3054.100,3055.100," a stone from Poland"
3055.800,3056.500," so yeah I'll"
3057.200,3059.700," I'll work on it our timing up a little bit"
3060.400,3061.800," but that's that's the poem"
3062.300,3062.900," that came"
3063.300,3064.600," that I wanted to share with you"
3065.200,3065.700," as a sort of"
3067.700,3068.700," just a sort of"
3070.000,3070.900," recap"
3071.100,3071.500," to the"
3072.200,3075.400," the previous session when I talked a little bit about this"
3076.800,3076.900," this"
3079.000,3079.400," gift"
3080.000,3083.300," and reconnection with kind of reconnection"
3083.900,3084.500," with"
3085.800,3089.400," with ancestors of ancestors of mine who died the"
3094.100,3094.100," so"
3094.700,3096.300," that's part of the problem"
3097.100,3098.600," that practice is for"
3099.600,3100.500," it's about"
3102.300,3105.200," I mean for some you know what it might so simply say in a certain way"
3106.600,3111.300," all these deep ancient traditions of wisdom and practice they all kind of say"
3112.200,3114.400," don't forget that you die"
3115.300,3115.800," that's a"
3116.100,3117.100," fundamental sort of"
3118.200,3121.000," foreground in in the systems usually"
3121.600,3122.800," you know really they're"
3124.100,3127.700," the kind of about what is life because what is death"
3128.300,3130.100," what is death because what is life"
3130.800,3131.500," finding out"
3132.600,3134.300," some way of coming to"
3135.000,3136.900," a really sincere piece"
3138.000,3138.800," with death"
3140.000,3142.500," I really sincere peace with the"
3143.100,3143.400," the"
3143.900,3145.300," total loss"
3146.300,3148.600," in a really the total loss that we're all"
3150.400,3156.500," actually facing now you know some it's it wouldn't be right to say that everybody is bothered about that"
3157.100,3157.800," in a lot of people"
3158.700,3160.400," are aware of it and quite"
3160.800,3163.600," okay you know fulfilling themselves while they live and they're"
3164.100,3166.600," they know that it'll end and that's not really such a problem"
3167.700,3170.900," other people just don't want to think about it"
3172.500,3175.800," and throw themselves I mean other like I mean I think we all contain"
3176.300,3177.400," some of these people in US you know"
3178.000,3178.900," other times we're just"
3179.300,3179.900," rushing and"
3180.500,3181.700," busy with with"
3182.600,3185.200," the stuff of life and not sparing a thought for that"
3186.200,3186.900," but"
3187.300,3192.300," but it's not only about us it's also about the people we lose you know we will lose people we love"
3193.200,3194.400," we'll lose all of them"
3195.600,3197.600," in this in a sense you know so we can"
3198.300,3199.600," become a k with that"
3200.200,3200.800," through practice"
3201.400,3202.800," either on the level of"
3203.800,3204.700," really becoming"
3208.000,3209.700," that piece with with the fact of it"
3210.500,3211.200," it's just really"
3212.400,3215.600," recognising it and allowing it into our"
3216.300,3217.100," nervous system"
3218.100,3218.500," and just"
3220.200,3224.200," finding there is a way and it's usually a way that involves"
3225.000,3226.300," some kind of vulnerability"
3227.500,3229.600," that we can't really get there without"
3230.300,3231.200," a Tenderness"
3231.700,3232.600," that acknowledges"
3233.300,3234.400," yes there's loss"
3235.100,3237.200," and loss means grief"
3237.600,3239.100," and we're okay with grief"
3239.800,3241.500," and we're not holding it off"
3241.800,3242.400," and when we"
3243.800,3245.900," when we pass through that some little"
3246.600,3249.900," membrane of vulnerability or of Tenderness"
3250.700,3252.400," we can come into a kind of"
3254.800,3260.800," I don't know I think of it as sort of service in some way slightly heartbroken place there's very okay"
3261.300,3262.000," that's very healthy"
3262.900,3267.600," and there's very lovely really to occupy and this we feel we're we're more full"
3268.100,3269.600," of life and we're more full of"
3270.200,3272.300," we're more fully being who we really are"
3273.000,3276.800," and this is this is how I see it in deep teachers of mine and"
3277.300,3279.100," beginning to finding it myself a bit you know"
3279.800,3280.900," that there's a place of"
3281.600,3283.800," heartbreak or through heartbreak"
3284.000,3285.600," to a place of real fullness"
3286.400,3287.700," that is really okay"
3288.300,3291.500," with the difficulties and challenges and losses"
3292.400,3293.300," that are part of our life"
3293.800,3294.100," ok"
3294.600,3295.900," there's also another way"
3296.400,3299.200," and practice helps with all the above but there's another way"
3300.200,3300.800," that practice"
3301.900,3303.000," can help which is"
3303.700,3304.900," which is more radical"
3305.800,3306.600," and that's the"
3308.000,3313.000," that's really the path of non-duality which isn't a path"
3313.900,3315.500," because the non-dual is always here"
3316.000,3316.800," it's when we make"
3317.600,3319.300," when we don't make when we suddenly"
3319.900,3322.500," when we're suddenly gone when suddenly somehow"
3323.200,3324.500," all that we thought we were"
3325.100,3325.500," is just"
3327.300,3330.000," a mirage and through the mirrors we see"
3331.400,3331.600," something"
3332.600,3334.600," we see something that may show up in"
3335.700,3340.500," certain ways but it's what we're seeing is never actually it because it is not seeable"
3341.200,3342.200," it's not nameable"
3342.700,3343.800," it's not speakable"
3346.200,3349.900," and it will it will it can show up in certain ways a certain sort of"
3350.300,3351.300," dimensions of it"
3351.800,3353.200," in the way it hits us"
3353.700,3354.800," and a very common one"
3355.400,3356.500," is a sense that somehow"
3357.100,3360.000," all of this multifarious multiplicity to us"
3360.700,3363.200," feel of experience and we call life of all the world"
3363.900,3367.400," is in some strange way all one thing"
3367.900,3375.700," but it's not a thing but it's one and we can we can just get hit with that and we know it's true and we know where Park"
3376.200,3378.200," of whatever that one mess"
3378.800,3380.300," is that's a common way"
3382.600,3385.100," when the slightly uncommon thing of seeing this"
3385.600,3386.200," shows"
3387.500,3388.300," up but there's other ways"
3389.100,3389.600," with enough to"
3390.100,3391.200," maybe go into that right now"
3393.900,3394.400," but again"
3396.500,3398.100," have we exhausted the problem no"
3398.700,3399.300," no that's"
3400.000,3400.400," there's another"
3401.300,3403.100," there's another very serious problems"
3404.000,3404.200," actually"
3405.100,3405.800," which is almost"
3407.700,3409.600," God in some ways it's almost harder"
3410.700,3412.500," it seems to be harder to resolve"
3413.200,3414.200," and that's the problem"
3415.100,3415.200," that"
3417.900,3421.100," and this is where the white Stone speaks again"
3422.600,3425.300," that we don't seem to know how to stop killing each other"
3426.800,3427.500," as a species"
3428.900,3431.700," where you know so brilliantly collaborative"
3432.500,3434.600," so if phenomenally creative"
3435.600,3437.300," especially when we co-operate"
3437.900,3442.400," you know these these great advances of culture of science or technology of"
3443.000,3444.700," you know that that brilliant you know"
3446.400,3448.000," and yet we still slaughter each other"
3449.400,3449.900," you know and"
3451.000,3453.300," practice is also about"
3454.000,3454.300," that"
3455.400,3457.300," and it's it's a tricky thing because"
3458.200,3458.600," um"
3459.300,3460.700," you know we live in these"
3461.500,3463.700," huge systems that seems like we have very little"
3464.500,3465.900," of most of us can have very little"
3466.400,3467.300," effect on"
3469.500,3470.100," but actually"
3472.200,3476.100," the Assumption in practice the I think is a fair one is that"
3482.900,3484.600," excuse me just let me just reset"
3485.200,3488.000," a moment this is the idea that come with us the right way"
3488.700,3491.000," the the the Buddhist position anyway"
3491.700,3492.000," is that"
3494.800,3496.700," it's not surprising that"
3497.400,3497.800," so much"
3499.800,3501.300," aggression and violence"
3501.900,3502.200," killing"
3502.700,3503.200," goes on"
3503.900,3504.700," in our species"
3505.300,3507.300," if you understand that we are"
3508.200,3508.800," in need of"
3509.400,3509.500," training"
3510.400,3510.800," basically"
3511.300,3513.600," when in need of detoxifying"
3514.300,3516.900," and Buddhists terminology from the three poisons"
3517.600,3518.400," that greed"
3519.000,3520.800," of hate or grass or I'll will"
3521.600,3523.500," or the wish to home to harm"
3524.000,3524.900," you know wish to harm"
3526.900,3529.000," that's the first two and the third one is"
3529.600,3531.000," ignorance or misunderstanding"
3532.700,3533.600," or misconception"
3534.800,3537.500," or not not understanding how things really are"
3537.800,3539.900," and one dimension of that not understanding"
3540.100,3543.000," is not understanding that we contaminated by three poisons"
3543.700,3543.900," you know"
3544.600,3547.500," to understand that is the start of practice"
3548.100,3549.000," because practice"
3550.100,3550.700," is the way"
3551.800,3552.100," I mean"
3553.700,3555.300," it's not the only way I'm sure but is"
3555.900,3557.000," but Force as a way"
3557.600,3558.500," to detoxify"
3559.300,3560.100," from the three poisons"
3562.100,3567.200," and that misunderstanding that third poison has another Level to it as well which is"
3568.400,3569.300," related to the"
3571.100,3571.600," the oneness"
3572.900,3574.700," it's not it's not knowing"
3575.000,3575.700," about that"
3576.300,3576.700," level"
3577.400,3577.600," that"
3578.200,3579.100," dimension"
3580.300,3580.800," in which"
3582.700,3584.700," all of this all of this life"
3586.000,3586.200," you know"
3586.500,3587.000," zoom"
3587.800,3589.000," tree car"
3589.300,3589.600," Airport"
3590.800,3591.800," you know oil Fields"
3592.700,3593.400," jungle"
3594.000,3595.100," Rivers all of it"
3595.600,3595.800," you know"
3596.700,3599.500," the what are they say the mountains the rivers the great Earth"
3599.900,3601.500," the sun the moon and the stars"
3601.600,3603.500," and then poetic way"
3604.100,3604.500," all of it"
3605.400,3605.600," is"
3606.200,3606.600," somehow"
3607.200,3607.800," one thing"
3608.600,3610.400," and what that one thing is"
3611.400,3612.500," actually we are"
3614.100,3614.800," so we're not"
3615.600,3615.800," the"
3616.600,3617.400," separated"
3617.700,3618.000," sense"
3618.400,3618.800," of me"
3621.200,3623.100," and that separated sense of me"
3624.000,3625.600," needs to sort of"
3626.100,3628.200," thinks it means to kind of want stuff and"
3628.800,3629.400," hate stuff"
3630.400,3631.100," away"
3632.000,3633.200," grab other stuff close"
3633.800,3634.400," in order to"
3635.400,3636.800," kind of persuade it's"
3637.600,3641.100," it's a it's it's it's sensor deficiency in a sense of lack"
3641.600,3642.800," and it's Hunger for things"
3643.800,3644.500," and it's fear"
3644.800,3647.300," being a sea in a"
3648.300,3651.900," in a turbulent world a difficult world and how to navigate it"
3653.000,3653.100," so"
3654.600,3654.800," that's"
3656.700,3657.600," so when that"
3659.300,3662.100," sense of the separate me is seen through"
3663.200,3663.400," then"
3664.400,3664.700," we see"
3665.600,3666.800," what we really are"
3667.700,3668.000," which is"
3670.200,3670.900," whole list"
3671.600,3672.500," but everything is also"
3673.000,3673.600," part of"
3675.000,3676.400," and from that perspective"
3677.200,3678.700," we don't we don't have"
3679.500,3681.500," we don't have the needs we don't have the"
3682.200,3684.700," the hungers and the cravings and the hates"
3685.600,3687.400," and and I'll Wills"
3688.800,3690.500," because it's all us"
3691.500,3692.100," and that"
3693.200,3697.600," you know in a certain way of thinking from the point of view these practices that"
3698.400,3698.700," is"
3699.700,3700.400," really"
3701.300,3702.300," the most promising"
3703.500,3704.400," undercutting"
3705.100,3705.400," of"
3706.300,3706.900," the human"
3709.200,3709.600," tendency"
3710.700,3711.000," for"
3711.600,3713.000," mutual slaughter"
3714.300,3717.000," because if you really know you're not separate"
3718.200,3719.900," you know to kill is to kill yourself"
3720.400,3722.400," in a sense to kill another is to kill yourself"
3722.800,3723.500," to harm another"
3724.000,3724.600," is to harm"
3725.300,3725.600," yourself"
3727.000,3727.200," and"
3729.100,3729.800," and you just don't"
3730.100,3731.200," you just don't want to do that"
3732.100,3734.000," you don't need to do that you know wanted it"
3734.500,3735.300," instead you feel"
3736.200,3736.500," more"
3739.500,3740.100," intimate"
3740.400,3741.600," or sensitive to"
3742.800,3743.500," the suffer"
3743.800,3744.900," of others"
3746.300,3750.500," and they you know there's in Buddhism there's this ideal of a bodhisattva"
3751.500,3752.900," who is a being Who"
3753.800,3756.100," really lives to persuade"
3756.500,3757.600," the suffering of others"
3758.800,3760.200," by whatever means"
3761.300,3763.500," well no not by whatever means by different means"
3764.100,3766.300," they wouldn't go around killing others to do with that"
3766.800,3767.300," it's"
3768.700,3770.700," actually there's there is some Buddhist"
3771.800,3773.700," there are sort of Buddhist kind of"
3774.400,3776.100," moral mathematics about that"
3776.800,3780.500," like you know what do you do if I mean there's actually there's a story about the Buddha"
3781.200,3782.200," in you know in a"
3782.500,3784.200," business Buddhist sort of focal or"
3784.500,3785.500," in a former life"
3786.100,3787.300," the book before the Buddha"
3788.000,3788.800," was born as"
3789.200,3790.400," sidata guitar tama"
3791.000,3792.000," he was on a ferry"
3792.700,3795.300," and he some kind of knew that one person on the ferry"
3795.900,3796.400," was gonna"
3798.100,3801.500," I guess they were going to kind of stove in the hollow the boat or something in some way"
3802.400,3804.800," this this deranged person was going to"
3805.600,3807.900," sink the ferry that had 500 people on it"
3808.900,3810.200," so the equation was like well"
3810.800,3814.000," do I and the only way to stop him was to kill him"
3814.600,3815.700," then the story so"
3816.400,3816.600," so"
3817.300,3818.300," is it okay to kill"
3819.000,3819.700," in that case"
3820.200,3822.400," is that okay to kill this one person to save"
3822.900,3823.700," 900 lives"
3824.400,3826.000," and in the story"
3827.600,3831.200," the the the future Buddha did kill the one person"
3832.000,3832.200," and"
3833.200,3835.500," and the and it's because the"
3836.500,3838.500," the Mechanics The karma"
3838.900,3843.400," are just very sort of straightforward it's just it's just cause an effect I mean in that system"
3844.300,3844.700," so having"
3845.400,3847.100," killed the one person"
3849.200,3849.700," somehow"
3850.400,3850.600," the"
3851.700,3852.300," karmic"
3853.000,3854.200," working out of it was that"
3855.100,3855.500," Buddha"
3855.800,3856.500," the Buddha had to"
3856.900,3859.100," add another 500 lives"
3859.600,3864.100," before to however many that already were lined up before he could become"
3864.600,3865.100," second money"
3865.800,3868.600," or sudata Gautama who became the bullet if you feel me"
3869.200,3869.700," you know so"
3870.600,3874.900," so each of those lives he saved he also had to sort of pay for with another life himself"
3875.600,3876.400," because it killed"
3878.100,3880.500," the person who would otherwise a kill them and I know"
3881.400,3881.800," and anyway"
3882.400,3882.600," um"
3885.000,3885.300," okay"
3885.800,3888.200," so that's a little um"
3891.600,3893.300," yeah a little bit of just"
3894.200,3897.200," you know I mean what a sort of 15 minute reflection on"
3898.300,3901.800," some of the aspects some of the dimensions of the sort of problem that"
3902.600,3903.000," practice"
3903.800,3904.500," has evolved"
3905.000,3905.400," to address"
3907.300,3908.400," now coming to"
3909.200,3911.200," effort and no effort what does this look like"
3912.700,3913.100," um"
3914.300,3916.200," well I think you know certain sense"
3917.800,3919.400," the effort side is"
3921.300,3924.700," his kind of quite almost sort of pragmatic and straight-forward it's like"
3925.300,3926.400," do we make the effort"
3927.200,3928.800," to to sit every day"
3929.300,3929.600," for example"
3930.700,3931.900," there is a bit of effort in that"
3932.600,3934.000," you know yes it can be"
3934.600,3936.700," it can become deeply habitual"
3937.400,3937.800," but you don't"
3938.300,3941.000," I think habits are set up with the method"
3941.600,3943.100," that's to be a little bit of a push"
3943.900,3944.800," however much we"
3945.300,3947.100," may at times being fused by it"
3947.700,3948.800," and other times we won't"
3949.500,3954.300," and very often we won't be at all we'll just you know working up in the morning and"
3955.200,3960.000," we kind of we kind of want to do it you know we'll kind of don't want to do it but kind of should do it"
3960.800,3963.400," and we just sort of make ourselves do it"
3963.700,3964.300," and that's"
3964.600,3964.900," oh"
3965.600,3966.100," habit"
3967.000,3967.700," creation"
3968.100,3969.500," which requires a bit of effort"
3971.700,3973.100," that may be the most important"
3973.700,3974.900," piece of effort in the whole thing"
3975.700,3978.800," but there are others when we're sitting and we've got a"
3979.200,3979.900," we've got a"
3981.300,3984.700," got our you know a particular practice that we think we're trying to follow"
3985.700,3986.700," well we're we're going to"
3987.200,3988.400," we're going to wonder from it"
3989.100,3990.400," many many times"
3991.400,3992.100," you know they say"
3993.000,3997.400," if you fall down seven times get up seven times if you fall down 7000 times"
3997.900,3999.700," you get up 7,001 times"
4000.500,4001.400," it's just like that"
4002.100,4005.100," so whatever the practice may be could be following the breath"
4005.400,4006.400," as we were doing earlier"
4007.100,4007.600," it could be"
4009.500,4011.100," being aware of body sensations"
4011.600,4012.200," of other kinds"
4012.800,4013.400," it could be"
4015.400,4016.400," it could be sitting with"
4017.800,4019.200," a little Cohan it could be"
4020.500,4022.400," various kinds of labeling practice"
4023.300,4023.600," whatever"
4024.500,4025.100," but all of them"
4025.800,4026.700," will sometimes be"
4027.300,4029.400," on it and will sometimes have wondered"
4030.300,4030.600," from it"
4031.300,4032.600," wondered from it"
4032.700,4033.300," do we then"
4035.300,4038.700," just let the the daydream go on if that's what it is"
4042.000,4042.400," or do we"
4043.400,4044.300," bring our attention back"
4046.500,4046.800," so that's"
4047.800,4048.100," effort"
4053.300,4053.500," and"
4054.800,4058.200," what about no effort now I'm going to say something else about effort just in a moment"
4058.900,4061.100," different angle on it but what about no effort"
4065.000,4069.900," well you know honestly I like no effort more actually maybe we all did"
4070.400,4074.200," but but it's a very I think personally that there's a very deep"
4074.800,4075.400," path of"
4076.300,4079.500," of practice of sort of mechanics of practice"
4080.200,4081.900," the way that practice can work"
4082.700,4084.900," which is much more about no effort"
4086.200,4087.400," but it might be that"
4088.000,4090.300," it's quite good to do some"
4091.000,4093.900," effort based practice first or do it at times"
4094.400,4095.600," I don't know I certainly have done"
4096.100,4096.700," tons of"
4097.700,4098.300," more"
4101.100,4105.600," you know more directed practice over the years myself"
4106.200,4108.600," and I don't I don't regret that one bit"
4109.000,4111.800," but maybe it's helped get me to a place where"
4112.400,4112.800," I really"
4113.700,4115.400," I loved just not trying at all"
4115.800,4117.200," you know I just I just let"
4117.600,4118.000," the sit"
4119.300,4121.500," just do whatever it does you know"
4121.900,4122.300," really"
4122.800,4126.500," I really don't have any intention for it most of the time when I sit down I just"
4127.200,4128.400," I just got I just let"
4129.100,4129.400," everything"
4130.200,4130.500," go"
4131.700,4134.500," I let go any intention of a better way to put it"
4135.200,4137.500," something to ask and sit there and if I'm thinking I'm thinking"
4138.500,4138.700," and"
4139.600,4141.000," if I'm in a blessed"
4141.900,4143.300," crystal Clear ease"
4144.100,4144.700," so be it"
4145.100,4145.700," it's all ok"
4146.400,4146.800," you know and"
4148.300,4148.500," and"
4149.500,4150.000," that's so that's"
4150.800,4151.500," that's what"
4151.900,4155.500," that's that's one way that no effort can can look"
4157.500,4158.900," but a little bit more"
4159.600,4160.000," sort of"
4161.200,4162.500," little bit more intentional"
4163.100,4164.900," with no effort is also possible"
4165.600,4167.100," where we we just have"
4169.200,4171.100," a pattern really"
4172.700,4173.500," of letting go"
4174.200,4174.900," over releasing"
4175.900,4178.000," that we just in and this is where"
4178.500,4179.900," it could this can actually be"
4182.100,4183.300," applied to"
4184.200,4184.800," a more"
4185.600,4187.800," directional path of practice more"
4188.300,4188.700," and more"
4190.600,4191.700," what's the word I'm looking for"
4195.800,4197.700," a part of being when we're doing a"
4198.400,4200.800," practice that really has a little bit of a method in it"
4201.500,4204.300," in a for example breath awareness or counting the breath or"
4204.900,4208.300," or labeling breathe in and out or still or a labeling practice"
4208.700,4209.800," those things that are more"
4210.400,4212.400," like here's that here's the thing you're going to do"
4213.500,4217.300," and you're going to try to keep doing it and if you're not doing it you're gonna try to come back to it"
4218.100,4220.300," in even within that kind of practice"
4221.200,4221.900," there's a place"
4222.800,4223.100," or"
4223.700,4225.000," a kind of release"
4226.600,4227.100," a way of"
4228.500,4229.600," adhering or"
4230.800,4232.600," Gathering around the practice"
4234.000,4234.400," without"
4235.400,4235.800," a lot"
4236.200,4237.400," of tightness"
4238.000,4238.600," and instead"
4239.400,4239.900," with a lot of"
4240.700,4241.200," looseness"
4242.200,4242.800," openness"
4243.900,4244.500," in other words we've"
4244.900,4248.400," got we may have a practice which we're intending to do"
4249.400,4250.900," but it's like we're sitting"
4251.800,4253.300," in a in an open field"
4254.600,4254.800," and"
4256.500,4256.900," we're just"
4257.700,4260.600," it's like we're sort of circling around a we'll or something"
4261.100,4262.400," yeah there is water"
4263.200,4265.900," there's a lovely water hole maybe that's a better metaphor"
4266.300,4268.500," we don't want to fall down as well there's a lovely water hole"
4269.200,4271.200," and that's the practice we're aiming to do"
4272.200,4273.800," but we're allowed to kind of"
4275.800,4276.600," move around a little bit"
4277.200,4279.900," drift here but we still want the water so we come back you know"
4280.300,4281.600," we're drawn to it"
4282.300,4282.500," not"
4284.100,4284.700," kind of police"
4286.300,4288.100," are just naturally magnetised"
4288.800,4289.700," that the loveliness"
4290.500,4291.700," of the practice that we're"
4292.900,4295.100," we're we're we're we're we're we're we're set out"
4295.400,4296.100," to follow"
4297.300,4299.000," okay so maybe you've got a bit of a sense of that there"
4299.500,4299.600," now"
4307.100,4308.200," so this is what I want to"
4308.900,4309.700," say about about"
4310.200,4313.000," effort and no effort as it relates to"
4315.700,4318.200," what what I guess we we must call Awakening"
4319.300,4319.700," in other words"
4321.700,4323.400,"um either moments or"
4324.500,4327.500," periods or a whole life perhaps where"
4327.900,4329.000," we wake up"
4329.500,4329.700," from"
4330.600,4332.200," the dream of being"
4332.700,4333.300," separate"
4334.300,4336.300," so what I was describing earlier"
4337.400,4338.400," as this sort of"
4339.000,4341.300," release from the sense of separate this"
4341.800,4342.700," and discovering"
4344.600,4347.100," for one of the better word one this"
4348.000,4348.900," which can"
4349.500,4349.500," be"
4350.100,4351.800," experienced in different ways"
4352.800,4353.100," but when"
4353.800,4354.100," that"
4354.700,4355.500," when we suddenly"
4356.900,4357.300," somehow"
4358.500,4358.800," sort of"
4359.500,4360.300," drop into that"
4362.700,4364.800," you know commonly it's it's kind of a"
4365.200,4365.700," sudden"
4366.500,4367.800," and surprising"
4369.200,4369.500," shift"
4370.600,4373.500," and you know early hits of it will fade"
4375.800,4377.700," with very very few exceptions I think"
4378.500,4381.000," and we come back and we're who we thought we were"
4381.500,4384.600," and we're man what was that and you know and and then"
4385.200,4387.100," if we're interested in a part of practice"
4387.900,4388.200," can"
4389.300,4389.400," can"
4390.400,4391.700," wear away"
4392.300,4393.700," what of skills that"
4394.300,4395.800," so that it becomes more accessible"
4396.500,4397.100," so that we can actually"
4397.800,4398.300," we can sort of"
4399.000,4399.600," open to it"
4400.100,4401.400," at any time"
4402.300,4405.000," that we remember to and then practice becomes about"
4405.400,4406.600," remembering too more"
4408.000,4412.800," and then practice beyond that becomes about living out the implications of that"
4413.400,4416.300," ever more consistent in evermoor deeply and fully"
4416.800,4419.100," so there's a it's sort of never ends really but"
4419.700,4421.700," but the but the but the point is this"
4422.100,4423.500," there's a debate"
4424.000,4425.000," there's a debate among"
4425.400,4425.900," among"
4428.200,4429.500," scholars basically"
4430.100,4433.400," about this there's people there's thinkers philosopher's and folks"
4434.000,4434.800," who are sceptical"
4435.800,4437.900," what I've just been saying they say well"
4439.300,4440.000," you're not"
4440.600,4444.400," binding something real about the way things are"
4445.100,4446.400," when you have an Awakening"
4447.200,4448.300," when you Awakened you're not"
4449.000,4449.700," you're not actually"
4451.100,4455.500," letting go of an illusion namely a sense of being a separate self"
4456.100,4457.000," and discovering"
4457.400,4458.500," a reality which is a"
4459.300,4461.800," great openness that holds all things"
4462.800,4466.000," and you know and there's I mean I say that because I don't want to go into"
4466.700,4475.200," a long digression on the many ways it can show up because it's not just that but let's say that for now a great openness that includes all things that somehow makes all things one"
4475.800,4477.900," you know seeing that that's not a reality"
4478.800,4479.200," you're"
4479.900,4480.900," Henry actually"
4482.100,4483.700," you've been sitting in this"
4484.500,4486.200," program whether it's then or"
4486.800,4488.300," advisor or whatever for"
4488.800,4489.400," for decades"
4489.900,4491.300," you've absorbed their"
4491.700,4492.600," sort of doctrine"
4493.100,4495.500," and you've just managed to engineer"
4496.000,4497.200," the kind of thing they say"
4497.700,4498.400," people can experience"
4498.900,4499.700," in other words you've been"
4500.500,4502.500," You've constructed and experienced"
4503.000,4504.000," based on the"
4505.200,4505.800," teaching"
4506.100,4509.900," to which you've been exposed and the scholars or thinkers philosopher's whenever"
4510.400,4513.100," who say that no known as constructivists"
4513.700,4515.200," because they think it's constructed"
4515.700,4516.800," that there is no"
4518.900,4521.000," real more real"
4521.400,4522.100," way things are"
4522.600,4524.100," to be found through practice"
4525.100,4525.400," okay so"
4526.400,4531.300," actually I probably don't need to say this because I think it's unlikely that"
4531.700,4532.600," there's anybody here"
4533.600,4536.000," well maybe I'm wrong I was going to say I doubt there's anybody here"
4536.400,4537.000," who doesn't"
4537.500,4541.600," think that they're must there might really be something to this practice there is not"
4542.100,4542.800," just about"
4544.400,4549.200," exposing ourselves to a certain set of beliefs and practices that will produce a certain result"
4550.000,4552.100," and that result has no more veracity"
4552.900,4553.500," than any other"
4554.000,4555.800," I doubt there's many here"
4556.100,4556.800," in the zoom room"
4557.500,4559.000," who think that but there might be"
4559.600,4560.300," and that's okay"
4561.000,4562.000," and because I want to say that"
4567.300,4568.300," I sort of feel that"
4569.100,4572.500," even if the constructive is are right"
4573.400,4574.300," it's actually okay"
4575.100,4576.300," because"
4576.900,4577.100," because"
4578.200,4578.700," maybe"
4581.200,4583.800," I'll tell you this I see the little few comments on this"
4584.400,4585.200," everybody I know"
4585.800,4589.200," among my colleagues and then teacher world you know"
4589.700,4590.500," who has had some of these"
4591.000,4593.300," breakthroughs and and maybe learn to"
4594.100,4597.700," sort of be very very conflict in their Outlook as a result"
4600.000,4601.000," it's it's very"
4601.900,4603.400," I think all of them would agree that"
4604.000,4607.700," if if somebody has a breakthrough experience like us describing"
4610.000,4610.600," they'll get"
4611.800,4612.300," the sensei"
4612.700,4614.300," that they've just seen"
4615.700,4616.900," all there is to see"
4617.700,4620.200," it's so radically different from the normal"
4621.000,4621.500," kind of"
4621.700,4622.100," tight"
4622.700,4623.300," finite"
4623.900,4626.700," constricted view of the of the ordinary"
4627.200,4628.300," separate sense of self"
4628.900,4630.000," it's so different from that"
4630.500,4632.200," and it's so much larger"
4632.700,4634.100," and so much more inclusive"
4634.900,4635.100," that"
4635.500,4636.500," there's always a sensei"
4637.300,4644.000," man I just seen the truth but I've seen it all I've seen realities in what reality really is"
4645.400,4647.600," find yes maybe so you know"
4648.400,4648.500," but"
4649.400,4651.700," trundle along another 12 years or something"
4652.300,4654.800," doing your practice getting more grounded getting"
4655.400,4655.900," you know a little bit"
4657.200,4659.600," more integrated that experience more integrated"
4660.200,4662.400," and guess what bam there might be another one"
4662.900,4664.000," and it's totally different"
4664.700,4665.100," it's sort of"
4665.500,4665.600," like"
4666.000,4668.100," wow it's not all one"
4669.200,4670.000," is nothing"
4670.600,4672.800," you know and that feels radically different"
4673.700,4677.200," and as I I was so sure I'd seen it all"
4677.900,4680.200," man now I've seen it all"
4680.900,4682.800," and then along we go another seven years and"
4683.500,4684.800," it's something else again you know"
4685.200,4686.300," it's like maybe"
4686.900,4687.300," that"
4687.600,4688.200," is no"
4688.900,4689.700," final answer"
4692.100,4693.400," you know maybe that isn't"
4694.200,4695.000," a final"
4696.100,4696.700," reality"
4697.500,4698.200," then anybody"
4699.000,4699.400," knows"
4703.000,4703.300," maybe"
4704.000,4705.200," the value is just"
4706.000,4706.800," knocking away"
4708.200,4708.900," the certainty"
4710.900,4712.800," you know what whatever it may be maybe"
4713.600,4717.500," somebody has a marvelous Awakening they get a pad on the back from the teacher"
4718.000,4719.800," and they start thinking great I've got it now"
4720.800,4721.800," and another kind of"
4722.200,4724.100," encrustation of certainty"
4724.900,4725.500," groups in"
4725.800,4727.900," and they get locked into being Awakened"
4728.300,4730.300," and Awakened now I must be Awakened"
4730.700,4731.700," Peter said sir you know"
4732.500,4733.100," well that's going to be"
4733.600,4734.300," blasted away"
4735.000,4735.400," for sure"
4736.200,4736.400," so"
4736.900,4737.500," what if"
4739.100,4739.600," what if"
4740.800,4741.500," they're just isn't"
4742.300,4742.600," final"
4744.600,4745.300," a final anything"
4747.600,4748.500," you know what would that"
4749.100,4749.700," feel"
4752.500,4753.500," like I mean for one thing"
4754.300,4755.300," god wouldn't it be"
4756.000,4758.100," wouldn't it be a protective against"
4759.000,4759.500," religious"
4761.400,4762.100," ideology"
4762.500,4762.600," and"
4765.100,4766.000," sectarianism"
4767.400,4769.600," isn't that probably how sectarianism"
4770.300,4770.600," tends to"
4771.700,4772.500," creep up on us"
4773.400,4774.300," we've got it"
4775.200,4776.300," our our one"
4777.400,4783.000," our God's the right one ah insight is the right one our Awakening as the right one"
4783.600,4783.700," you know"
4784.500,4785.200," you get"
4785.800,4787.300," I mean what I'm just describing"
4787.900,4788.300," can you"
4789.200,4790.800," can interact with group dynamics"
4791.600,4791.700," you know"
4793.100,4793.300," little"
4794.000,4794.500," core"
4795.700,4797.500," corporate so to speak dynamics"
4798.500,4798.800," you know"
4800.700,4805.400," and not corporate in the business but human what's the right words you know little gathe"
4806.900,4807.400," what's that"
4807.800,4808.600," coming in the right word"
4809.500,4811.500," cool can I take a say corporate like that meaning"
4812.200,4815.400," little organizations of all organisational they say dynamics"
4817.700,4817.700," so"
4818.300,4820.400," what that what about if"
4821.800,4823.400," if there's just isn't an answer"
4824.600,4826.400," yeah what does that what does that feel"
4828.500,4830.300," like but maybe it feels quite good no"
4831.000,4832.000," just letting go"
4833.000,4833.900," of any final"
4834.700,4835.400," answer"
4836.900,4837.800," no one's got"
4839.000,4841.000," it not even ramana maharshi"
4842.500,4844.300," maybe he just found that there was no bottom"
4845.400,4846.200," and there was okay with that"
4849.900,4851.700," they talk actually in zen about the"
4854.800,4856.100," the bucket with no bottom"
4857.100,4858.100," the bottom miss bucket"
4859.300,4860.700," the bottom of the bucket fell out"
4861.600,4863.200," the bottom of the world fell out"
4864.600,4866.300," the bottom of the Universe fell out"
4867.100,4867.300," you know"
4867.700,4869.400," that doesn't sound like much of a"
4870.000,4871.100," final answer is it"
4872.700,4873.900," just the bottom fellow"
4874.800,4876.800," it's quite a good way probably for us to"
4877.200,4878.100," think about practice"
4879.100,4882.900," and then from that perspective coming back to effort no effort"
4883.600,4883.900," and in"
4884.900,4885.500," you know just"
4885.900,4888.100," does effort seem appropriate when there's"
4888.400,4889.000," no bottom"
4891.100,4891.800," there's no end"
4894.200,4897.300," it's more like the more aligned we can get with"
4898.200,4898.900," no end"
4899.800,4901.100," isn't that some sort of"
4902.900,4904.000," isn't that some kind of"
4905.400,4907.700," I'm doesn't that just speak to no effort"
4908.800,4910.600," because any effort in a sense that"
4911.100,4912.300," has to be in the wrong direction"
4912.900,4914.400," yes let's put"
4914.700,4916.300," we're still not going anywhere anyway"
4917.700,4920.000," if we think we know where we're going we're going the wrong way"
4921.900,4924.600," so should I not go anyway no that's wrong too you know"
4930.000,4931.400," so I think there's a wisdom in"
4932.500,4933.100," no effort"
4934.600,4935.000," but I would"
4935.300,4938.000," I would I would I would I feel it would be wrong to say"
4938.700,4940.000," there's no width"
4940.300,4941.400," them in effort"
4942.000,4943.700," that would be little bit too certain"
4944.800,4947.800," I think there's wisdom in effort and there's Wisdom and no effort"
4950.900,4952.500," and there's probably Wisdom and no wisdom"
4955.600,4958.200," I don't know but I'll tell you further find out"
4960.500,4961.100," well I think that's"
4962.200,4965.200," I'm sure I missed some steps in the argument that I thought"
4966.400,4969.600," might have happened if it can even be called an argument"
4970.000,4972.300," but I'm I'm not sure what they were so"
4973.900,4974.800," I think I'll stop there"
4975.700,4976.800," with one more"
4979.100,4981.100," ah holding of the precious stone"
4981.900,4983.100," I think this stone is the best"
4985.000,4986.200," is the best speaker here"
4987.400,4989.700," on the zoom screen on this little zoom screen"
4998.800,4999.100," okay"
5000.900,5001.500," so let's have a little"
5002.100,5003.000," a little pause"
5003.500,5003.700," and"
5005.500,5006.200," we can do some"
5007.900,5009.900," some chat and some"
5012.000,5016.000," chat questions or some unmuting questions as well"
5017.200,5020.000," I got this sense that I haven't"
5021.000,5024.800," I've kind of promised that people who had a question he had a hand raised"
5025.300,5027.300," in a prime meeting would be cool back on"
5028.100,5030.200," but I'm really sorry I don't think we"
5032.200,5035.600," I don't think at least I don't know who those were now"
5036.400,5038.200," but Mary Frances is an upgrade"
5038.600,5039.200," if anybody"
5039.900,5040.400," Waze"
5040.900,5043.600," you know either the last two meetings left with a"
5044.000,5045.300," a raised hand at the end"
5046.100,5047.200," not having a chance to speak"
5047.700,5049.800," and would like to now just raise your hand again"
5050.500,5050.800," now"
5052.400,5052.900," ah"
5054.200,5055.800," I'm just one second I'm just gonna"
5056.900,5057.600," pause for a moment"
5078.700,5081.200," okay great Mary Frances please unmute"
5082.400,5082.700," hi"
5083.200,5083.800," great to see you"
5087.100,5091.100," oh thank you so much Henry for that"
5092.200,5094.700," really inspiration you know opening"
5095.200,5096.000," so timely"
5096.600,5097.500," and the poem"
5098.300,5098.700," so"
5099.400,5103.000," so close to so many of our hearts as we watch what's going on in the world"
5104.900,5105.100," but"
5105.600,5109.900," here's my question I have this assumption maybe right maybe wrong but"
5110.500,5113.800," that this sound of loaded with"
5114.300,5115.000," creativity"
5115.300,5117.300," that people who live their lives"
5118.000,5120.400," as writers or poets or artists"
5121.300,5124.000," and could you please talk about"
5125.000,5128.900," no effort and effort when it comes to flow"
5129.300,5130.300," and somebody"
5132.100,5133.200," I mean I definitely"
5133.900,5139.600," with all these years of meditation with you and in this program"
5140.400,5140.700," I"
5141.400,5142.300," see the difference"
5143.000,5143.300," in"
5144.300,5145.700," the body and my work"
5146.800,5147.100," how"
5147.700,5148.900," love is there"
5149.800,5152.000," so much more than ever"
5152.800,5152.900," you know"
5153.700,5158.000," but could you speak to that issue of effort no effort when it comes to"
5158.600,5158.900," create"
5159.300,5159.600," creative"
5161.300,5161.600," Flo"
5163.100,5165.000," yeah for sure I mean I'm I would"
5165.600,5169.900," just have a caveat I'm sure there's people here could speak to it better than me but"
5170.300,5171.500," I mean what I find is"
5176.100,5180.700," in my own case with with with with with you know with the sort of a writing side"
5182.500,5184.000," it tends to be like"
5184.500,5186.400," the other way around that the no effort"
5187.700,5188.300," since first"
5188.800,5191.500," and and something just come you know whether it's a paragraph or"
5192.300,5193.300," possibly a poem they"
5193.800,5197.200," it's begins with like a an impulse in a some kind of"
5198.300,5203.700," set of a little thing that's not quite a feeling it's a little bit like a feeling but it's not exactly a feeling it's some"
5206.100,5210.300," some intention or something arises plus a phrase and"
5211.000,5213.000," I know I want to ride it down and I do"
5213.700,5214.900," and it often comes"
5215.700,5216.100," without"
5217.400,5218.200," effort really"
5219.100,5220.400," but then I find"
5221.300,5223.300," I will tell you in most of my poems is being"
5224.200,5227.200," really it's been years of efforts actually after"
5228.000,5228.500," the initial"
5229.200,5229.800," thing came"
5230.600,5233.000," to try to find tune it and make it"
5233.700,5237.000," there's this Scottish poet I think it was Norman mccay who said"
5237.900,5239.300," he wanted his poems"
5240.100,5240.900," to read"
5241.500,5244.200," to the to the to the reader to sound the reader"
5245.100,5248.500," as as as if they as if they"
5249.000,5250.500," had been written in the time it"
5250.800,5251.000," took"
5251.600,5252.200," to read them"
5252.700,5253.400," that easy"
5253.900,5256.500," and that was really hard and took him a long time"
5257.500,5260.800," and then I think it was another Scottish poet he said he thought"
5261.600,5262.600," a poet should read"
5263.200,5264.000," as if it came"
5264.500,5265.700," in the time that it took"
5266.100,5267.100," to smoke one cigarette"
5268.700,5268.800," and"
5270.900,5273.300," I suppose we don't do much of that these days but"
5274.100,5276.100," back in the day he said that"
5276.500,5277.400," it was a common practice"
5278.000,5279.800," but and that and that again that's"
5280.600,5282.400," to make it feel like that is not so easy"
5283.100,5283.600," but um"
5284.900,5286.400," but but with you know with"
5287.000,5287.900," with somebody"
5288.700,5289.900," with meditative"
5290.200,5290.700," blow"
5291.100,5292.800," with somebody and meditation"
5293.400,5295.400," I think it's probably the other way round"
5296.500,5300.300," that there can often be effort in"
5301.400,5302.300," you know adhering"
5303.300,5304.100," to the"
5305.200,5308.400," that whatever the practice is that will prove to be the little"
5309.100,5310.200," trail of breadcrumbs"
5310.900,5313.600," that leads into the great forest of samadhi"
5314.000,5316.000," in a following the little child of pregnancy you have to go"
5316.500,5318.600," from by crown or stone by stone"
5319.100,5319.900," you have to do that"
5320.500,5321.300," and then all of a sudden"
5322.300,5323.500," something shifts"
5324.200,5325.300," and the quality"
5327.000,5330.700," shifts of the meditation and it becomes one of no effort"
5330.900,5331.900," and that's basically"
5332.500,5333.400," one of the key"
5334.700,5334.900," sort of"
5335.900,5336.600," features of"
5337.100,5338.500," samadhi in meditation"
5340.100,5340.200," so"
5341.000,5345.000," I know that what I just said about the creative side is is probably"
5345.700,5347.200," I mean it's not um"
5348.200,5353.400," I'm sure there's many other people have many other views on that as well I think I mean I know writers Who"
5354.200,5354.800," who kind of"
5355.200,5358.000," painstakingly craft centres by sentence you know"
5358.700,5361.000," and and and and that seems to be their way"
5362.000,5364.200," so I think there's there's probably a"
5365.000,5368.400," whole slew but you know that what's that old line you know"
5369.600,5372.200," 10% inspiration 90% personal"
5376.000,5378.700," but do you think that with meditation we seem to get"
5379.500,5379.600," I think"
5380.000,5381.900," I think over time we will find that"
5382.500,5384.800," in on the meditation side you know it will come"
5385.500,5389.100," that samadhi or some he's in the process of meditation"
5389.400,5389.900," would definitely"
5390.600,5391.500," develop over time"
5392.000,5392.900," and we'll get there quicker"
5393.600,5394.800," but not by any means"
5396.100,5400.400," a absolutely consistently it's just not a straight line you know"
5402.700,5403.100," thank you"
5403.700,5405.900," no thank you very Francis ok great"
5408.100,5409.600," Tara I actually can't see"
5410.700,5410.900," the"
5412.000,5413.600," Nicole hi hi hi hi"
5416.500,5417.800," yeah if you could just done me"
5425.000,5426.200," yeah she still yeah"
5426.900,5427.000," great"
5428.200,5429.800," two for the last couple of Sundays"
5430.500,5431.700," I've just wanted to say"
5432.300,5433.100," that the app"
5433.400,5434.300," is extraordinary"
5435.600,5435.700," and"
5436.200,5437.600," I wish that I could"
5438.000,5443.000," I find when I tried to explain to people how extraordinary it is it's such"
5444.800,5445.900," it's hard to explain"
5446.400,5447.700," because it's so"
5451.300,5451.900," I don't know but"
5453.200,5456.500," I feel every day I'm so struck by"
5457.100,5457.600," every day"
5458.500,5461.600," there's this accumulative effect but it's very subtle"
5464.100,5465.000," I just I just"
5465.700,5467.700," about you for creating something"
5468.600,5469.800," as extraordinary"

5487.500,5492.500," and he's grinning from ear to ear because it's I can see it's just behind the camera on a sofa"

5505.400,5508.300," I just have to second what she's saying"
5509.200,5510.600," because the app"
5513.400,5515.600," the the very the subtle"
5516.500,5520.500," turning of my attention to my sensory experiences and now"
5522.600,5523.000," it is"
5524.900,5526.300," so helping"

5544.800,5547.100," with with I was just doing it on my own"
5548.900,5550.600," of the it was very profound"
5551.900,5554.500," that it there was no me"
5555.600,5556.100," caring"
5556.900,5557.900," and know me"
5558.600,5560.700," doing that vision the scene"

5563.300,5567.100," it all came back I am very much me right now talking but"
5568.400,5570.400," but for those few moments"
5571.000,5571.600," I had a"
5571.900,5574.300," I had that experience and I went this is"
5574.900,5575.300," incredible"
5576.200,5579.900," so I want to tell you I'm I'm getting a lot out of that app really am"

5595.700,5597.000," reality that in the middle"
5598.000,5600.400," where I'm so sure I am"
5600.900,5603.200," and I'm so sure I've been all along"
5603.900,5608.100," although I must admit I've never really checked that closely"
5608.700,5610.300," but I just know I'm in here"
5610.700,5611.400," in the middle"
5611.900,5612.600," and then"
5613.400,5614.100," all of a sudden"
5614.900,5615.300," somehow"
5615.900,5618.300," the stars are line the lenses are line"
5618.700,5620.600," and boom I'm really looking in there"
5621.000,5623.400," and there's no one looking and there's no one there"
5623.900,5626.600," and boom it's just it's just clear"

5655.600,5657.900," let me have a quick look at the chat see what we got"
5660.100,5661.500," another nice"
5662.000,5664.000," comments on the app I'm so happy"
5665.700,5668.300," I love that the app is so in line with automatic habits"
5668.800,5670.100," and I keep giving it to an image"
5670.600,5674.000," thank you thank you very much for answers yes please hey anybody who's liking it"
5674.600,5675.200," please please please please"
5675.900,5677.200," do things share it"
5677.700,5680.400," and write us a review on the app store"
5680.700,5682.600," or they or the Google Play store"
5683.300,5685.000," thank you the little bit there"
5685.700,5685.900," um"
5687.900,5688.600," this reminds me"
5689.200,5693.300," David Hawkins levels of consciousness consciousness to put is forever expanding"
5693.800,5696.200," in his in this view there are levels of Enlightenment"
5696.700,5698.400," yeah I think that's probably true"
5701.900,5703.100," but in a certain way"
5706.400,5710.100," I mean I find myself just questioning the word enlightenment honestly"
5710.900,5711.100," like"
5711.600,5713.300," if we think that it's just"
5714.300,5715.800," ever unfolding or"
5717.200,5718.800," layer after layer"
5719.900,5722.100," peeling back and there's no end to them"
5723.800,5726.100," at what point is it in light of month"
5727.100,5728.000," you know isn't it just"
5728.500,5729.800," New Horizons new"
5730.400,5731.900," is the it's look at that"
5732.600,5733.400," Lori said"
5733.800,5735.600," is the event Horizon exactly"
5736.300,5739.100," exactly and what if it's just on and on"
5739.800,5740.600," and maybe it's"
5741.200,5744.700," not even sort of consciousness is the universe that just"
5745.300,5749.000," is you know still unfolding still spreading still expanding"
5750.000,5752.100," maybe it'll be different when it starts shrinking"
5752.600,5754.500," if it's going to do that or some say"
5754.900,5758.200," you know maybe enlightenment will work in Reverse maybe"
5758.800,5760.900," I don't know you know what I mean who knows"
5763.100,5766.100," yeah um I want to just see Carla said"
5766.800,5772.000," ever since he brought up dehumanizing I see my efforts of Seeking personal humanizing"
5772.500,5775.300," and trying to avoid feeling dehumanized"
5775.600,5778.200," I didn't realise that was in my experience attending named"
5778.400,5779.900," it thank you very much Carla that's"
5780.600,5782.900," that's great I feel that too"
5783.600,5784.400," and actually you know"
5785.500,5788.600," God this is a little bit of a tangent but I've been-- Reading"
5790.700,5795.100," because I'm such an erudite fellow I've been reading Milton recently Paradise Lost"
5795.800,5799.400," which I read years ago and was amazed how much I enjoyed it"
5799.800,5801.700," you know sometime in my mid 20s it's"
5802.000,5804.700," I read it a had to read it a school and I was 16"
5805.200,5805.900," some of it and then"
5806.500,5809.100," I read the whole thing in my I think my mid-20s and"
5809.500,5810.500," actually loved it"
5811.500,5813.700," and now I'm reading it again and I'm loving it"
5814.300,5814.500," and"
5819.000,5820.500," oh I know what I want to say yeah"
5821.700,5822.800," here's a little insight"
5823.300,5825.100," that I think I had from it"
5825.900,5827.400," there's a bit in it when"
5828.200,5829.900," you know Adam the first human"
5831.400,5831.700," is"
5832.300,5832.700," having"
5833.300,5835.700," all the creatures lined up"
5836.300,5839.400," in front of him and they're all marching by two by two"
5840.500,5841.400," so we can name them"
5841.800,5843.100," because he was the name giver"
5843.900,5845.500," he gave everything it's name"
5846.700,5850.300," and then as and then actually I was in conversation with Jack the other day about this and"
5851.200,5851.700," wow"
5853.700,5856.500," animistic cultures indigenous cultures"
5857.200,5858.200," they um"
5859.900,5862.700," they I mean the core of animism"
5863.400,5864.000," isn't it that"
5865.000,5866.000," things that we"
5867.400,5867.800," folks"
5868.300,5868.900," civilised"
5869.400,5870.300," civilised people"
5870.900,5872.100," don't think have"
5872.600,5873.300," conscious lives"
5874.200,5875.700," do have conscious lives they"
5876.100,5876.700," the tree"
5877.300,5877.500," is"
5877.900,5878.300," animal"
5878.600,5880.100," the same way human being is"
5880.700,5883.200," the mountain is the river is the clouds are"
5884.100,5887.800," I think in some Navajo traditions the clouds that ancestors"
5889.400,5890.800," are our ancestors"
5891.900,5892.000," you know"
5892.600,5894.200," that everything is alive"
5895.500,5897.300," and there's all Adam"
5897.500,5898.500," naming everything"
5899.400,5901.100," locking it in with a name"
5902.700,5903.500," and what is it"
5903.900,5904.000," you know"
5904.700,5906.400," isn't it a kind of dehumanising"
5907.200,5908.400," kind of or it"
5908.800,5910.800," maybe maybe it's not exactly the right term"
5911.200,5913.900," but a d animating or a d life"
5914.600,5915.600," taking"
5916.200,5917.100," reducing life"
5917.900,5920.200," reducing fixing constraining"
5920.600,5921.300," with a name"
5922.100,5922.500," rather than"
5923.200,5924.000," it's a life"
5924.500,5927.000," yes exactly the white marble stone is animal"
5927.300,5929.000," exactly It's Alive"
5929.500,5930.000," now this is what"
5930.600,5932.900," this is actually one of the beautiful things in zen's and"
5933.400,5935.700," I don't know where there's then is related really to"
5936.200,5936.700," the ancient"
5937.500,5939.200," animistic traditions of China and"
5939.900,5941.900," and Japan I didn't maybe it is but they"
5942.800,5946.000," Joe shoot was asked you know what is then"
5946.900,5947.900," what really is then"
5948.600,5949.100," and he said"
5949.500,5951.400," without hesitation it's not then"
5951.800,5952.500," it's not Zen"
5953.500,5954.000," let's say"
5954.200,5954.800," well what is it"
5955.900,5956.900," why is it not then"
5957.700,5958.500," it's alive"
5958.900,5959.700," It's Alive"
5960.200,5963.100," it's like a Discovery that this whole world is alive"
5963.900,5964.500," this whole"
5965.000,5966.900," everything that we think is not alive"
5967.600,5968.400," table chair"
5968.800,5969.100," up"
5969.600,5969.700," you know"
5970.400,5972.300," pavement even steering wheel"
5972.800,5974.400," it's all alive it's all"
5975.100,5975.600," you know"
5977.000,5977.800," we might have to"
5978.600,5983.500," to satisfy some folks we might say well not really a lives all consciousness it's all consciousness"
5984.200,5989.000," but actually that doesn't get it what it can be like to really meet it it's like it's all"
5989.500,5990.100," alive"
5990.500,5991.800," it's all busy with"
5992.600,5993.200," animacy"
5993.900,5994.000," you know"
5995.900,5995.900," so"
5996.300,5996.500," okay"
5997.000,5998.100," that was in response to"
5999.400,5999.600," yeah"
6000.000,6002.700," the dehumanizing point let me just take a quick look"
6004.500,6008.800," time or to go Henry you were talking about awareness and what a gift it is that we're aware tool"
6009.400,6012.900," I find myself stopping many times that during the day and just being aware of"
6013.300,6015.100," and experiencing something a sound"
6015.500,6016.100," a thing"
6016.600,6017.700," a bird a tree"
6018.200,6019.500," it is so wonderful"
6020.200,6021.500," it thank you it is"
6022.700,6023.100," a gift"
6023.400,6024.600," kind of a Mini"
6024.900,6025.500," Awakening"
6026.300,6026.600," yes"
6027.800,6028.200," yes"
6029.300,6032.300," the Direct the meeting the receiving"
6032.900,6033.000," the"
6034.600,6036.300," the no nothing in between"
6037.800,6038.900," just the sound"
6041.900,6043.700," ah okay lovely to raise him-"
6044.300,6045.300," do you like to unmute"
6050.000,6050.400," hi"
6050.700,6051.300," Henry"
6051.700,6052.000," hi"
6053.400,6056.400," I love the apps I second everything that's been-- said"
6057.100,6057.500," I just"
6059.000,6061.900," finished zen mind beginner mind and"
6062.700,6064.900," this is the 50th anniversary"
6065.600,6067.600," edition in the epilogue"
6069.400,6069.500," the"
6071.500,6073.400," against name Should Know It"
6074.600,6075.400," David Chadwick"
6075.900,6077.000," mentions that"
6078.000,6078.600," initially"
6079.300,6081.100," Roshe Suzukis"
6082.100,6082.800," dermatocranium"
6086.100,6091.000," and it was breaking with some sort of tradition as sodas and tradition"
6091.700,6094.200," for them to begin to record but a group of people"
6094.800,6097.400," around him felt it was so important and"
6098.000,6100.800," and he finally at we asked in"
6101.200,6102.800," the end result was this book and"
6103.500,6105.400," chadwicks gone and on about how many"
6105.900,6107.900," people were so influenced you know from"
6108.500,6110.000," you know all the poets and"
6110.800,6114.100," Phil Jackson the basketball coach and everything anyway"
6115.300,6118.000," as I was reading it I was thinking thank God"
6118.600,6122.400," you know you Embrace the internet in the way you did and"
6123.200,6124.300," allowed it during"
6124.800,6126.000," the quarantine"
6127.200,6131.400," to reach out to reach out to reach so many more people and I"
6131.900,6134.200," I found a correlation between"
6135.700,6139.000," the recordings of roshes Suzukis talks and"
6139.700,6141.600," and you're disseminating"
6142.200,6143.600," your your wish"
6144.200,6145.800," for so many people to find"
6146.300,6148.400," what meditation can offer"
6149.000,6149.300," so I"
6150.100,6150.700," am so grateful"
6152.100,6153.200," what I want to ask"
6154.500,6158.600," and maybe I'm dancing on the head of the pin here so please tell me"
6159.900,6166.000," in your app I'm in the section where we're talking about silence and then stillness"
6167.000,6170.300," and in the Silence you ask us to"
6172.100,6174.800," have a sense can you sense that it's larger"
6175.600,6178.400," that it's in folding all sound"
6179.400,6183.500," and I and I do I I feel and folded by it"
6184.100,6185.500," and then in the Silence"
6186.100,6188.600," still in this section can you feel"
6189.500,6189.800," It"
6191.900,6197.100," moving out of your own stillness and create and stillness coming all around"
6198.300,6199.100," where I sit"
6199.400,6202.500," and I feel it I feel the edges of my form"
6203.100,6204.900," you know blurring like ink"
6205.700,6206.700," oh and I think"
6208.300,6210.200," am I imagining this"
6210.500,6212.600," is this my imagination"
6213.500,6214.700," or is it something"
6215.700,6218.800," I mean if it feels like I'm connecting or I'm"
6219.100,6220.100," heading somewhere"
6220.800,6221.100," you're"
6221.700,6222.400," pointing toward"
6222.900,6225.500," but then I think maybe I'm just imagining this"
6226.200,6226.500," and"
6227.100,6228.200," is there a difference"
6229.200,6230.500," that's a great question"
6231.200,6232.100," I mean I think you're coming"
6232.500,6236.600," it could be brushing against that question about constructivism you know"
6237.200,6240.100," all we constructing that I'll tell you everything that I"
6240.600,6243.900," that's in the app is things that I've experienced myself"
6244.900,6246.200," and and I tend to"
6247.200,6248.700," you know the best I can be trying to"
6249.300,6251.700," convey them the way I experienced"
6252.600,6252.800," them and I"
6253.300,6254.500," often have felt"
6254.900,6256.100," that I get into"
6256.700,6260.600," you know I do a little bit of my own work so to speak to become still"
6261.800,6266.000," and then it it does feel like I find a larger stillness"
6266.600,6266.900," and now"
6267.600,6269.000," I didn't read that somewhere"
6269.500,6274.700," I just that's just like and so I was I wasn't trying to aim to have that experience at any time"
6275.000,6277.000," I just find it often feels like that"
6279.000,6281.000," does that mean it really is like that"
6281.400,6281.800," because"
6282.200,6283.200," I just don't know"
6283.800,6284.800," I think it doesn't seem"
6285.500,6287.000," him it seems quite possible-- because"
6287.800,6288.900," I mean after all you know"
6291.400,6293.600," I mean this world maybe hurling along"
6294.100,6296.300," I don't know 40,000 miles an hour or whatever it is"
6296.800,6297.800," but it doesn't feel like"
6298.600,6300.300," it it feels like it's very still"
6301.300,6303.900," the earth beneath us yeah of course there can be earthquakes but"
6304.500,6305.400," by and large"
6307.400,6308.700," this vast Earth"
6309.500,6310.200," is still"
6312.300,6313.100," you know and I think"
6313.900,6315.000," I think there's a way in which"
6315.900,6318.500," often we're quite sort of agitated within"
6319.900,6321.700," and it's only when we get"
6322.900,6323.600," less"
6324.200,6325.300," agitated we sort of"
6325.800,6326.900," settle down within"
6328.900,6330.900," I suppose I'm talking about myself here when I"
6331.600,6332.800," settle down within"
6334.800,6337.400," I I I think I always or"
6338.700,6341.600," maybe I don't know always look for it but anytime I look for it"
6342.300,6343.600," I find oh yeah"
6344.500,6346.600," there's a kind of quiet here"
6347.900,6350.000," that most of this natural world"
6351.000,6352.200," the birds the trees"
6353.600,6355.600," in a yellow wins the clouds"
6356.200,6356.900," the mountains"
6358.000,6359.000," they're very quiet"
6360.900,6361.900," and there's just a sort of"
6363.000,6365.100," lots of stretches of great choir"
6365.700,6367.800," and a few little sounds of babbling stream"
6368.400,6369.400," some bird call"
6369.800,6371.900," and the birds go quiet in a it's"
6372.700,6373.800," it's actually very quiet"
6374.300,6376.100," he's only a lion roars you know"
6376.600,6377.200," on the Savannah"
6377.900,6378.900," but a lot of the time"
6379.600,6380.400," it's quiet"
6380.900,6381.800," I think this world"
6383.300,6385.500," may be rather quiet and still"
6386.500,6389.100," and it takes us getting quiet and still"
6389.700,6390.700," to start to notice it"
6391.200,6392.100," it's on a join it"
6393.100,6394.500," so thanks for the question"
6395.700,6396.900," hey let's do one more"
6398.000,6398.700," Dana hi"
6404.600,6405.300," wait you're"
6405.900,6406.600," alright"
6407.100,6408.100," hi hi I'm"
6409.400,6411.200," two weeks ago during our sit"
6411.600,6414.200," you are asking us to engage with the Cohan"
6415.100,6416.300," your original face"
6418.000,6419.700," and it was very effortful for me"
6420.900,6421.900," and then you said this"
6423.000,6424.200," precious profound"
6424.900,6427.900," thing you said often in a Cohen there's a word"
6428.800,6429.600," you could omit"
6430.600,6433.700," you said Take Away original take away the word face"
6434.000,6435.700," the original face someone the word"
6436.400,6438.200," face was gone and it was the original"
6440.000,6443.300," it became a completely different experience that was effortless"
6444.500,6446.000," and today during the sit"
6446.400,6447.700," you're speaking about breath"
6449.100,6451.000," and by adding the word this breath"
6451.900,6454.600," the word this talking about the power of a word"
6455.900,6458.600," transforming and experience even though it's language"
6459.800,6464.600," so taking out the word face two weeks ago today you said this breath and started breath"
6466.400,6469.500," and the same thing happened it went from an effortful set to"
6471.000,6472.400," an effortless sit"
6473.300,6474.000," so I just wanted to"
6475.400,6480.000," pay related it back to another sit and the way that language you're in parting to us"
6480.900,6481.800," in a word"
6482.600,6483.800," can transform the moment"
6486.000,6488.600," then thank you so much for sharing that I mean I would"
6489.100,6493.300," that seems to me a beautiful way of speaking to the wisdom of cohan's"
6493.800,6494.400," really because"
6495.100,6498.100," they're alright they're quite strange you know in the in the Buddhist"
6498.500,6499.500," in the realm of Buddhism"
6500.600,6501.300," which is"
6502.000,6504.800," kind of where they belongs are a little bit odd"
6505.300,6506.000," you know there are"
6506.500,6509.600," Buddhist instructions to sit with there's Buddhist sort of"
6510.400,6513.800," you know scripture or sutras you can sit with pieces of"
6514.600,6515.900," but coins you know they're just"
6516.300,6516.600," they're just"
6517.500,6518.600," little phrases and"
6519.800,6524.300," and it but there their power is is it exactly what you're describing that they can"
6526.300,6528.900," it's a it's a word or two or three or whatever it is"
6529.900,6530.900," and the word"
6531.900,6533.100," can make something happen"
6533.800,6534.100," to us"
6534.900,6537.700," that doesn't almost doesn't seem related to the word it's so"
6538.500,6539.400," it's a different from"
6539.800,6541.100," what we think words are"
6541.700,6545.500," it's like and one teacher man Reuben habito roshi he says"
6546.800,6548.900," their words to go beyond words"
6551.300,6554.200," Cohen's a words to take us beyond words"
6555.500,6558.300," which I think it's a nice way of describing thank you Dana very much indeed"
6559.200,6559.900," for sharing that"
6560.700,6561.400," yeah thank you"
6563.500,6566.200," okay I'll just take a quick look in the chat is that the last"
6573.600,6575.000," oh is it is this some"
6576.200,6579.700," someone saying yeah I'm happy that certainly people are happy"
6580.000,6581.300," experiencing no self"
6581.700,6583.100," but quite frankly I find it"
6583.400,6584.500," bloody terrified"
6585.000,6586.000," could you comment please"
6588.200,6594.100," well I think that's very natural and and I'd like to say the comment would be"
6598.100,6599.100," let's see"
6600.000,6600.500," well first of all"
6601.400,6602.400," don't worry about it"
6602.800,6603.000," I mean"
6603.800,6604.600," it's not like"
6605.000,6608.200," we all have to go that way in our practice"
6609.200,6609.900," you know there's"
6610.100,6611.900," there's some people who are really curious"
6612.700,6613.100," about"
6613.900,6616.100," what the self is some people just are"
6617.100,6619.700," and many of us just aren't"
6620.300,6622.100," I wasn't at all for the first"
6623.200,6624.900," I don't know eight years of my"
6625.200,6626.600," meditating life I just"
6627.000,6629.900," I just wanted to calm down and be less miserable"
6630.500,6631.100," and and"
6633.700,6636.600," so it's perfectly okay to have no interest in that whatsoever"
6640.800,6641.700," that's the point one"
6643.700,6645.400," and if it's a terrifying prospect to"
6646.000,6646.600," it probably means"
6647.000,6653.400," this is not the time you know don't be practicing for that kind of Reason practice it practice for the reasons that you have"
6654.000,6654.700," the practicing"
6656.700,6658.100," another comment that"
6658.400,6660.700," I I don't know if this is going to be any help at all"
6663.000,6663.200," but"
6663.800,6664.200," actually"
6665.000,6666.200," I mean the truth is"
6668.900,6670.800," that in a moment when"
6672.300,6672.700," our"
6673.300,6674.300," when we're clear"
6675.100,6675.300," that"
6675.800,6677.200," there is no self"
6679.900,6681.400," there really is no self"
6682.400,6685.500," so they're really isn't anyone there to be"
6686.000,6686.400," afraid"
6687.700,6687.900," and"
6689.000,6690.900," it's actually not uncommon"
6691.400,6694.000," I don't think it's quite common but it's not uncommon"
6694.600,6695.200," for somebody"
6695.700,6698.300," to have an unexpected glimpse of that"
6699.300,6701.500," suddenly their self is sort of gone"
6702.300,6706.100," and then it quickly comes back their oh my god what was that in their scared"
6706.300,6708.400," but they lurcher away from it they"
6709.000,6709.100," and"
6709.600,6713.600," but in the actual instant when the self was gone"
6714.500,6715.300," there was no fear"
6717.300,6717.400," and"
6718.500,6722.600," I don't I don't suppose that's particularly reassuring actually"
6723.200,6727.800," but the two things really that when there's no self there is no fear"
6728.500,6729.300," a hundred percent"
6730.700,6730.900," but"
6731.900,6737.200," it could be that the the self would quickly come back to oh my god you know be very scared"
6737.700,6737.800," so"
6738.500,6740.300," I don't know I don't know really"
6741.500,6745.300," I think it's not it's like that's one says it's not today's problem you know"
6745.900,6746.600," if if you"
6747.400,6747.600," if you're not"
6748.000,6749.000," particularly interested in that"
6750.100,6750.600," no problem"
6751.300,6754.900," if you are interested it but you're not seeing it not a problem"
6755.300,6758.600," it's only a problem in a sense if you've seen it and then you're terrified"
6759.100,6759.300," you know"
6759.900,6760.000," so"
6760.700,6761.600," so I suppose"
6762.600,6766.600," if that if what I've just been saying hasn't helped with the fear about it"
6767.400,6768.900," then you just sit with the fear"
6769.500,6770.800," and you process the fear"
6771.600,6774.000," as we would any other difficult emotion"
6774.400,6775.200," in our sitting"
6775.900,6777.200," we let it be there"
6778.500,6780.600," you know we we come to it as a"
6781.400,6782.300," body Sensation"
6783.800,6785.900," right so if we find the fear in the body"
6786.700,6787.700," maybe is in the chest"
6788.600,6791.100," of usually a good place to start looking"
6791.700,6792.200," maybe it's"
6792.600,6796.400," not very clear might just be a little tightness or a little bows or something"
6797.300,6797.900," in the chest"
6799.000,6802.800," and then we just sort of locate that and we sit with it and we get soft"
6803.700,6804.600," and tender"
6805.200,6806.600," and we're allow it to be there"
6807.500,6808.200," and we loved it"
6809.600,6810.200," and we loved it"
6810.700,6811.300," and it becomes"
6812.000,6812.400," okay"
6814.800,6816.700," okay so I'm actually now going to stop"
6817.500,6819.000," and Sarah is going to come in"
6819.400,6821.900," with some announcements so please don't don't go quite yet"
