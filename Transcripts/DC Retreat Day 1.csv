6.100,6.600,"wow"
7.800,9.000," well great that"
9.300,10.400," everybody could make it"
11.200,12.000," thank you for coming"
13.200,13.400," yeah"
14.800,16.900," ummm we're we've got a we've got a"
17.600,18.800," deep dive happening"
20.200,20.900," deep but"
21.600,21.800," but"
22.300,22.900," but easy"
23.300,24.800," nice restful"
25.300,26.600," easeful not"
27.400,28.400," not grueling"
29.400,33.500," not like going to a Zen monastery and having to get over 4 a.m."
34.400,35.900," and having to not move a muscle"
36.400,38.400," but 12 hours of the day you know"
39.100,39.800," not like that"
40.900,42.300," this is an easy way"
43.600,44.800," is a way of"
45.900,46.500," contacting"
49.700,51.100," in the midst of our busy"
51.300,51.900," lives"
53.200,53.700," a great"
54.800,55.300," space"
57.000,58.700," that's actually always here"
62.100,63.600," waiting to be recognised"
64.100,64.500," basically"
66.200,67.300," and you know we've we've"
69.100,71.400," actually I must say I always get it because I live in a"
72.100,73.500," little mountain City"
74.000,75.300," and a large space"
75.700,76.800," all around you know"
77.300,78.600," the mountains the desert"
79.500,80.000," forests"
82.000,84.700," and staggeringly beautiful Dawn's"
85.300,88.600," and even more beautiful sunsets every day basically"
89.600,90.600," and a huge Sky"
91.700,92.400," I get"
92.600,94.300," a very big thrill coming back"
94.700,100.500," to a city a real city I mean I've lived in New York I lived in London I lived in Edinburgh"
103.700,105.100," and there's that congest"
105.500,107.100," you know you know what I mean it's tight"
107.600,109.500," it's tight they're sort of isn't space you know"
110.400,114.200," it's going to buildings everywhere people everywhere in how houses everywhere cars everywhere"
114.900,117.500," and actually it's it's a real thrill when you know live among"
118.400,119.300," that but the thing is that"
119.700,121.500," actually even in"
122.400,123.100," the congested"
124.000,124.500," City"
125.800,126.700," this space"
128.100,128.600," I'm talking about"
129.500,130.500," is still present"
132.800,135.900," it's like you know we call this weekend three days"
136.400,137.100," going deeper"
139.000,139.200," and"
141.000,144.000," again that I don't know whether that sounds inviting or daunting or"
144.900,146.200," or neither"
146.600,149.300," but actually the the point about the deeper"
150.300,150.500," part is"
151.100,152.300," that just under"
153.900,156.200," the surface of our lives"
156.800,160.500," just under our lives as we know them as we commonly experienced them"
161.600,163.400," the ordinarily experienced that"
165.000,169.100," it's it's it's it's that the right preposition is hard to find you can say under"
170.600,171.400," kind of"
171.800,172.400," within"
173.900,174.500," ah kind of"
175.100,175.700," behind"
176.800,178.400," our ordinary sense of things"
179.400,180.100," kind of"
181.100,181.600," beyond"
182.500,185.700," our ordinary sense of things I don't like that so much it sounds a bit grand"
186.200,186.300," but"
186.800,187.600," just here"
189.700,193.000," when we engage in stillness in being still"
193.700,194.600," in being quiet"
195.400,195.600," in"
196.100,197.000," detaching"
197.800,198.700," disengaging"
199.400,199.500," from"
200.300,203.100," the whole a to b model"
204.000,205.400," I'm here and I got to get there"
206.000,207.900," that's things that I want and I got to get it"
208.400,209.300," a to b"
209.600,211.300," their home model that somehow"
212.100,213.200," what I really need"
214.000,215.000," is not quite here"
216.500,219.900," you know whether it's getting stuff or getting you know a new job"
220.600,221.200," a new"
221.600,223.200," home a new partner a new life"
224.200,226.000," if I just had a slightly different life"
226.800,227.600," all will be well"
228.000,231.600," a to b when we just disengage from that we don't say"
232.200,234.300," no no you're wrong don't try to get that we just say"
235.200,236.100," put that down"
238.100,239.300," just for a little bit"
241.200,241.800," put down"
242.800,243.500," the AA"
244.100,244.500," to b"
245.600,245.900," model"
247.700,250.300," as words worth called it getting and spending"
251.300,253.600," getting and spending we lay waste our"
254.000,254.400," powers"
255.300,258.300," why do we do that we'll because basically if we stop doing that"
258.900,259.500," trying to get"
260.000,261.700," trying to spend trying to get trying to spend"
262.100,263.200," if we stop doing that"
264.800,265.200," that we find"
266.000,266.500," that what"
268.600,270.300," we really really need"
271.600,272.100," and want"
273.400,274.700," perhaps has been here"
276.100,276.600," all along"
277.900,278.100," just"
278.500,278.900," waiting"
280.000,281.000," for us to stop"
282.500,283.400," the a to b"
283.900,284.100," model"
285.300,286.000," if you see what I mean"
286.700,288.000," so in the midst of"
288.400,289.900," our ordinary a to b"
290.300,290.700," living"
291.300,291.600," actually"
292.800,294.100," is present all the time"
294.900,295.500," what's present"
296.200,297.400," well there's no name for it"
298.100,300.300," actually I said great space earlier"
301.300,301.500," and"
303.000,304.200," it's sometimes it feels like that"
306.100,306.700," my new book"
307.300,309.100," called it original love"
310.200,311.200," sometimes it feels like that"
313.400,314.300," then calls it"
314.900,319.100," original face the face you've had since before your parents were born"
320.000,321.000," okay whatever"
321.700,322.900," and Buddhism"
323.900,326.200," Buddhism calls it original nature"
327.200,327.800," something"
328.500,330.900," that all things including us"
331.800,332.200," chair"
334.200,334.400," okay"
334.900,335.700," that'll that'll do"
336.500,337.900," but actually it doesn't have a name"
339.500,340.400," but it's present"
342.000,342.500," and and"
343.300,344.700," fortunately mercifully"
348.200,349.500," it's not that hard"
350.000,351.600," to get little glimpses of it"
352.400,353.600," and to sense it"
354.500,357.300," and to find the kind of peace that it can bring"
358.300,359.800," you know it's not that you have to do"
361.100,362.200," three decades"
362.800,363.800," in a monastery"
364.300,365.500," to start getting a hint of it"
365.900,366.500," not at all"
368.900,372.000," I know people who did three decades in a monastery has said"
372.500,373.300," I wish I hadn't"
373.600,374.300," I wish I just sort of"
375.200,377.500," had a little bit of guidance to just help me"
378.100,379.700," taste what I really wanted to find"
381.400,383.300," you know because it's it's always within us really"
384.500,387.200," anyway this I know I'm throwing out a lot of different things right now"
388.500,391.900," because actually we don't know what is going to open the door"
393.100,393.200," you know"
394.000,395.200," the little door in here"
396.400,397.500," just a little crack"
398.200,400.200," nothing it actually it doesn't even need to be a door"
401.000,401.900," just a crack"
403.100,404.100," of a kind of"
404.600,405.100," releasing"
409.900,410.700," so we're already"
411.600,414.600," you know we're basically becoming into stillness as well we're doing"
419.700,421.100," all the hustle and bustle"
422.200,423.300," and then we arrived"
424.500,424.600," here"
428.900,429.900," we can take a breath"
433.700,434.700," for so long"
435.000,435.800," you know we"
437.500,438.100," we haven't"
439.200,443.900," I said I suspect a lot of you are very serious practitioners so you have been doing this"
444.400,446.500," but some of us for so long we haven't really"
447.800,448.900," given ourselves a chance"
449.900,451.100," to draw breath"
455.000,456.400," and that's that's what we can do"
457.400,457.500," now"
461.700,463.500," so we're going to start with a little sit"
465.300,465.600," and"
467.300,468.700," let me just have a quick check"
473.200,474.800," has please raise a hand"
475.300,476.500," if you are"
477.700,480.100," if you have some kind of Regular meditation practice"
481.500,482.700," and just hold it there a sec"
483.400,487.100," okay so it's a Forrest to hand almost entirely but not quite okay"
487.800,487.900," fine"
488.500,488.900," if you've"
489.600,494.900," if you've meditated before but don't consider yourself like a regular meditative please raise your hand"
496.900,499.500," if I don't okay and is there anybody whose simply never done it before"
503.100,504.300," okay wow okay"
504.700,505.600," we're all adapt"
506.100,507.500," yeah great"
509.000,509.400," well"

522.600,523.800," AC temperature"
526.000,526.800," oh yeah we'd have a lot"
527.300,528.600," it's a little warm that's what I was thinking"
529.100,530.300," it's a little warm can we"
531.100,532.300," up the AC and"
533.800,534.700," another cushion"
536.500,537.600," maybe I can do it here"
546.900,547.100," yeah"
547.700,551.000," okay hey thanks a lot maybe look it's it's I think you can go up and"
551.900,552.300," see it's just"
552.800,555.500," you know why I mean the the fan power"
556.600,557.700," oh okay yeah"
558.600,559.200," you know what I mean"
560.000,560.200," yeah yeah"
560.800,563.300," yeah okay take this back okay thanks"
565.700,565.900," sorry"
567.400,569.100," look how demo are there cushions back there"
570.100,571.100," there's a stack of cushions"
579.200,579.400," yeah"
580.700,581.200," um"
581.700,584.400," so we got okay there's a few little ground ground"
585.800,586.900," encouragements"
587.500,588.100," that I want to give you"
592.400,596.200," if you're on a chair and you suddenly wish you were on a cushion"
597.400,597.900," on the floor"
599.000,599.900," cushions of"
600.700,601.900," back in that corner"
602.800,605.500," if you're on a cushion and you suddenly wish you on a chair"
606.000,607.000," there's a few spares"
608.100,612.000," and yeah I'm going any time like if it's mid"
612.500,613.300," meditation"
616.500,620.500," the the encouragement is like this if you are going to make any kind of move"
621.100,622.500," including getting up to going"
622.900,625.400," to go and get you know an alternate seating arrangement"
626.100,626.300," just"
627.100,628.100," before you move"
629.700,632.100," just be aware that you're about"
633.000,634.300," that you're about to move"
636.000,636.900," so then you can move"
637.900,639.200," what we call mindfully"
640.100,642.300," in awareness that you're moving"
644.300,646.200," and if you do that you won't disturb anyone"
647.100,648.300," that's the magic of mindfulness"
651.500,653.000," another ground rule is"
653.600,656.200," yeah I was going to avoid the word rule but okay ground encouragement"
656.800,657.200," is"
657.700,658.500," if you get"
659.400,659.900," tired"
661.200,662.900," if you start feeling some kind of"
663.900,665.300," ripple of fatigue"
665.900,669.300," or even a straight swell ocean swell of fatigue"
670.100,672.900," roles into your experience it's not at all uncommon"
673.900,674.200," because"
675.300,681.200," there's a there's an idea that we all walk around with some amount of a quote unquote sleep debt"
682.900,686.100," and when we when we when we start relaxing and being still"
687.200,689.600," and you know we're actually"
691.000,697.700," increasing the parasympathetic nervous system and we're dialling down the sympathetic nervous system basically we're"
698.400,699.400," getting into more of a"
700.900,705.100," equivalent equilibrated nervous system calm and nervous system"
705.800,707.700," and it's not at all uncommon to find"
709.800,710.600," wow there's"
711.300,713.400," this there's there's fatigue in the system"
714.600,718.800," you know there's the stress a daily life in the system and as that begins to settle"
719.700,721.900," or boy that's in fatigue in the system so"
722.600,724.600," what I think and I don't know"
724.900,727.400," I mean you might not feel very comfortable doing this but actually"
727.800,729.700," really the best thing is if you're getting that"
730.300,731.800," really the best thing is to lie down"
732.600,735.600," you know and now I know it's not magically comfortable here"
736.500,739.000," but it's it's I think it's okay I've I've done it on"
739.600,741.700," all kinds of circumstances in my life"
742.400,746.000," went travelling and I'm in a railway station I have a sit and sitting on my gosh"
747.000,750.500," just put this back in the old days put my backpack on the ground and just lie down"
751.100,752.900," and some some out of the way corner"
753.500,754.500," and it's go out for"
755.200,757.700," five minutes ten minutes 20 minutes you know whatever is needed"
758.700,760.500," but actually and you also might think"
761.400,763.500," when I'm here to engage in this"
764.600,767.200," in this process that Henry's leading US on"
767.600,768.500," I don't want to be sleeping"
769.200,771.200," but actually that may be the most"
771.800,772.800," helpful thing you can do"
773.600,774.900," and just sort of trust the"
775.900,777.900," you know the the snippets whatever little"
778.800,779.600," problems met"
780.700,784.100," come out of my mouth that would be helpful for you you'll get what you need you know"
784.600,787.500," and the most important thing is taking care of yourself"
789.200,790.700," I don't think I gotta go home and"
791.400,792.600," lie down on my couch and"
793.200,796.400," that's going to take me an hour to get there and you know none of that just"
797.200,798.600," go to the side of the room"
799.000,799.700," and lie down"
800.300,802.700," and maybe if you can get a cushion under your head that we're good"
804.600,805.700," well that's it for ground rules"
807.900,812.500," no I guess there's another we won't have a we won't have biological brakes midstream"
813.300,814.800," you know so just go out if you really need to"
815.900,818.300," because everybody know how to do that how to use the restrooms"
819.100,820.200," there's info on"
820.600,821.800," look there's info out there right"
841.000,841.800," could everybody hear that"
842.900,843.000," yeah"
843.900,844.900," 10004"
845.200,845.700," star"
846.900,847.200," okay"
847.600,848.300," get you back in"
855.900,856.000," okay"

857.500,859.500," we're going to do let's get let's get comfortable"
860.000,861.600," for about a 20 minute sit"
862.400,863.300," and I'll be guiding it"
865.200,865.600,"as well"
869.000,869.700," as improving is"
870.300,872.000," coming the cooling is coming okay- great"
872.900,873.100," okay"
885.400,886.900," yeah you know just a little"
887.500,888.100," background"
888.700,889.000," to this"
891.200,893.300," as we're getting comfortable get yourself settled in"
893.800,895.500," and I'm just going to tell you a little story from"
896.400,897.400," the early Buddhist"
898.200,899.900," scriptures that there was a farmer"
900.700,902.300," who came to the Buddha"
903.600,906.500," and said I got all these problems you know my kids"
907.200,907.400," don't"
907.900,910.000," disobedient and rebellious the"
910.700,916.100," workers are doing what they're supposed to do then they're not plowing properly one of my oxen is lame"
916.900,919.300," and actually my wife's very unhappy with me"
919.800,924.100," and went on with this litany of problems and the Buddha interrupted him and said I know"
924.900,925.200," I know"
925.600,927.100," you've got 83 problems"
928.200,931.900," and the Farmer says what do you mean I got a everybody has 83 problems"
932.800,935.200," and if you solve one another one will pop up"
935.600,936.500," to take his place"
937.800,938.000," and"
938.700,942.500," and well and the pharmacist will can you help me with them he says no"
942.900,943.900," I can't help you with"
944.100,947.300," any of those 83 problems you're always have 83 problem"
948.700,950.600," and the promises but you're the Great Teacher"
951.400,952.200," surely you could help"
952.700,954.900," that I can't help with any of those problems"
955.500,956.600," but you also have"
957.100,958.900," an 84th problem"
959.800,960.700," and that one"
961.200,962.000," I can help you with"
963.000,965.500," so I can great well what is my 84th problem"
966.800,969.400," it's that you don't want to have any problems"
971.900,972.400," and that"
973.200,974.100," I can help you with"
976.000,980.400," now actually I love that story I feel a great mercy in it"
981.200,981.900," it because actually"
982.700,983.300," what if"
984.000,984.800," it's okay"
986.000,989.400," that my life is the imperfect incomplete"
990.200,990.800," UN"
991.100,992.100," slightly unfulfilled"
993.400,997.000," monster that it is you know or maybe I've got very serious problems"
998.000,998.800," in amongst the"
999.600,1001.200," along with lesser ones"
1002.000,1003.300," maybe one of my loved ones"
1004.600,1007.700," is having a basically interactively hard time"
1009.000,1011.100," untreated hard time it happens"
1012.800,1013.600," even that"
1014.300,1015.200," is it possible"
1015.700,1016.400," that somehow"
1016.900,1017.900," with all of our"
1018.600,1019.500," hardest stuff"
1021.000,1021.800," that there is"
1022.600,1023.300," a kind of"
1024.600,1025.200," release"
1026.300,1027.900," that we can still find"
1029.300,1029.900," you know a"
1032.300,1035.500," resolution of that 84th problem"
1037.300,1040.400," no no I don't want these big problems please"
1041.300,1042.000," take them away"
1043.600,1044.400," maybe that"
1044.800,1045.100," wish"
1046.000,1048.500," can be sort of a swayed and met"
1050.000,1050.900," that longing"
1051.400,1053.000," that somehow there be peace"
1053.900,1054.700," even in the midst"
1055.700,1056.500," even in the midst"
1057.700,1058.400," there can be peace"
1059.900,1061.400," so that's where we're"
1062.300,1063.500," that's where we're exploring"
1064.500,1065.400," that's our edge of"
1067.700,1068.100," Discovery"
1069.500,1070.300," okay I'm going to sit"
1071.300,1071.500," two"
1072.700,1073.000," so let's"
1074.800,1075.700," let's get comfortable"
1077.200,1078.500," rearrange anyway you like"
1079.000,1079.900," at any time"
1080.600,1084.000," and if you're going to rearrange just be noticed just noticed that"
1084.700,1087.500," you're you're about to do it so you know you're about to do it"
1091.700,1094.600," you can you can either close the eyes or lower"
1095.200,1095.900," lower the gaze"
1099.400,1099.400," yeah"
1100.200,1101.800," we don't need lights really yeah"
1103.400,1103.500," okay"
1107.000,1110.000," so that's spend just a moment being aware of the body"
1110.900,1111.500," feeling your"
1111.800,1112.200," your seat"
1114.400,1115.500," your seat beneath You"
1116.000,1116.300," that's"
1116.900,1117.000," that's"
1117.900,1119.900," the you're entrusting your weight"
1120.900,1121.200," too"
1127.500,1131.400," right off the bat there's a kind of choice point you can have your back"
1132.200,1133.400," being supported by"
1134.600,1138.100," the back of the chair that's great if that works for you just go that way"
1139.100,1142.100," and let your let your back release into"
1143.300,1144.200," the back of the chair"
1145.400,1145.900," and let"
1146.100,1151.700," let your your your back side your buttocks release into the seat"
1152.500,1153.500," supporting you"
1155.200,1156.500," imagine you're sitting in a"
1157.000,1157.900," great hand"
1158.800,1159.700," cupped hand"
1160.800,1162.300," and it's really supporting you"
1163.200,1164.900," if you're back is free"
1165.500,1166.200," not touching"
1167.800,1168.800," any support behind"
1169.600,1170.000," we want to"
1170.800,1172.700," we want to do our best to have it balanced"
1174.700,1175.600," so let the"
1177.700,1181.300," you know the there's usually some emphasis in the traditional"
1183.000,1185.100," approaches to posture that"
1185.600,1189.200," you have a little bit of lumbar arch in the lower spine"
1189.600,1192.400," that's if you're back is unsupported if it's free"
1194.000,1195.200," and sense your seat"
1196.500,1198.800," and sense the crown of your head floating"
1201.500,1202.800," floating above your seat"
1206.000,1207.800," just kind of be aware of the space"
1209.400,1209.700," between"
1211.900,1215.000," the the moolah bander the the route"
1215.800,1217.300," write down at the bottom of the spine"
1220.000,1221.500," where you're connecting with the seat"
1222.600,1223.900," and the crown of the head"
1227.500,1228.600," feel the"
1229.900,1233.400," space between those two points those two areas"
1236.900,1238.900," and again if you're back is free"
1239.400,1242.000," see if you can align the two so that you are really"
1243.300,1245.400," your head is floating easily"
1247.300,1248.200," above your seat"
1252.800,1257.200," and next step for us often is to relax the jaw"
1259.700,1260.700," we carry a lot of"
1264.200,1267.100," well of tension and of the day's momentum"
1268.100,1269.000," in the jaw"
1271.700,1273.800," so what's it like to let the jaw go"
1276.100,1277.500," let it actually sink"
1278.800,1280.700," and maybe slide forward"
1282.200,1283.000," it may only go"
1284.500,1285.900," you know a millimetre"
1288.700,1289.300," or two"
1292.100,1293.100," and that might be enough"
1297.000,1298.700," that you feel a little shift"
1302.400,1304.000,"something releasing"
1311.200,1312.600," you're soft"
1316.700,1318.900," and throat also"
1321.300,1321.700," soft"
1330.500,1331.300," again you might have"
1333.300,1334.100," eyes closed"
1334.600,1338.000," some of you might have eyes open with the gaze lowered"
1338.800,1340.200," both are equally fine"
1347.200,1349.600," so bringing some awareness to the eyes"
1353.300,1354.900," let them be resting"
1356.800,1357.900," in their sockets"
1362.200,1365.000," rather where they are eyelids are open or closed either way"
1367.100,1368.000," eyes resting"
1375.800,1376.900," if they're open"
1379.900,1381.300," you can be aware of"
1381.600,1383.100," whatever's appearing on the"
1383.700,1385.000," screen of sight"
1385.900,1387.500," colours patterns shapes"
1388.600,1389.500," light and dark"
1390.800,1391.600," just let it be"
1393.000,1394.100," a kind of screen"
1394.700,1395.900," that's that's appearing"
1396.900,1398.200," if your eyes are closed"
1399.400,1400.700," actually rather similar"
1401.900,1403.200," you can be aware of the"
1404.900,1405.800," grey scale"
1407.900,1408.500," patches"
1409.000,1410.200," that are lighter and darker"
1411.500,1412.200," maybe some"
1412.900,1414.100," hints of colour"
1418.400,1419.300," rest with"
1421.300,1421.800," seeing"
1425.300,1426.700," the screen of vision"
1440.300,1443.300," knowing that right now you don't have to do anything"
1456.100,1457.300," we're settling the body"
1461.000,1464.100," starting to begin to settle the mind"
1470.900,1472.100," very gently"
1473.500,1475.100," coming into our"
1476.100,1477.600," actual experience"
1479.000,1479.900," Here and Now"
1482.600,1484.400," very gently though no"
1486.400,1488.300," no forcing it it's like we're"
1490.300,1492.600," imagine a shy man being"
1493.500,1494.400," coaxed into"
1495.600,1497.500," a stable or into a Paddock"
1501.900,1503.600," that's very gently"
1505.100,1506.300," poking ourselves"
1510.500,1511.400," into the"
1513.000,1513.900," Here and Now"
1522.400,1524.100," seeing what we're seeing"
1529.100,1530.800," where their eyes are open or closed"
1548.500,1551.500," and now let's also bring in"
1553.600,1555.000," the soundscape"
1559.700,1561.000," starting to hear"
1566.000,1566.900," starting to listen"
1605.400,1607.600," again no need to force anything"
1609.200,1610.000," just let"
1610.900,1612.700," the Field of sound"
1614.000,1615.000," show itself"
1662.100,1662.700," hear"
1683.600,1685.800," can you let yourself be"
1686.800,1687.700," choir"
1698.900,1700.100," and you come back"
1701.800,1702.000," to"
1702.900,1703.600," hearing"
1744.600,1745.800," means now let's"
1746.700,1749.400," let's come into the body again feel your feet"
1749.900,1750.400," on the floor"
1753.600,1754.200," however there"
1755.200,1757.500," making contact with what's beneath them"
1762.100,1763.600," sense that contact"
1770.800,1772.200," sends your lower legs"
1775.100,1778.100," is there perhaps a light tingle or warm"
1780.300,1780.900," in them"
1783.800,1786.000," and maybe some contact as well"
1795.100,1797.000," since the upper legs"
1798.600,1799.200," knees and"
1800.700,1801.700," hamstrings and"
1802.700,1803.300," quads"
1808.800,1810.100," and into the seat"
1810.700,1811.100," again"
1825.400,1827.000," and sends the lower back"
1832.200,1832.800," whatever it's"
1833.800,1835.000," experiencing right now"
1840.300,1841.400," and the mid-back"
1848.900,1851.300," and the upper back and shoulder blades"
1857.000,1858.500," that the shoulders relaxed"
1867.500,1869.500," let the hands relax"
1873.300,1874.700," the hands be limp"
1881.600,1883.400," and let the arms also be"
1884.400,1884.900," Slack"
1910.900,1911.600," and letting"
1913.800,1915.300," that in their awareness now"
1916.600,1918.100," open up to the belly"
1920.600,1922.700," in the belly be warm and soft"
1930.700,1934.400," you might send some movement in the belly associated with"
1936.200,1937.900," becoming and going of breath"
1948.700,1954.600," and that's expand the awareness to include the diaphragm the mid- Drift"
1955.700,1957.600," the middle of the front of the torso"
1960.000,1962.300," adding that area also be warm"
1963.500,1964.100," and soft"
1980.600,1981.100," and"
1981.600,1983.700," moving up into the heart area"
1985.100,1986.000," the chest"
1992.300,1994.500," and there be a warm glow"
1996.100,1998.000," through the chest softening"
2021.000,2025.100," and now becoming aware of the back of the neck and the back of the head"
2030.900,2032.300," imagine that some"
2032.600,2034.700," gentle kind hand is"
2035.400,2037.600," gently lifting the back of your head"
2038.700,2040.500," drawing it slightly upward"
2042.200,2045.200," elongating the back of the neck just slightly"
2046.400,2048.600," it's a little bit like a puppy"
2049.700,2050.300," being lifted"
2051.400,2053.000," by it's by his mother"
2054.000,2055.100," at the back of the neck"
2056.500,2059.700," just something like that a little light lift"
2062.100,2064.600," the back of the head the back of the neck"
2071.300,2072.800," but actually may allow"
2075.400,2076.600," a great"
2079.800,2081.700," softness and slackness"
2083.000,2084.500," to spread right through the body"
2085.800,2088.400," just like that puppy how limp they go"
2090.300,2091.500," when they're lifted there"
2108.600,2110.900," it's the last few moments will rest"
2113.200,2114.200," that yourself rest"
2115.700,2116.600," in the quiet"
2258.100,2259.200,"just keep listening"
2331.500,2333.400,"hey thank you all very much"
2335.400,2338.300," for joining in that and being really nice and quiet and"
2340.300,2342.800," beginning our beginning our journey you know the"
2345.300,2350.500," the the the the the process I think of gatherings like this when we've got a few days"
2350.900,2353.400," is is there's a kind of whole arrival process"
2354.700,2356.300," takes a while actually to arrive"
2357.100,2359.300," we don't walk in the door and we've arrived actually"
2359.800,2360.800," we're still arriving"
2362.100,2365.600," there's a there's a there's an old story about a student or a"
2366.600,2368.600," potential student visiting a Zen master"
2370.400,2376.300," you know way back in 9th century China and and asking so what are you got what's what's this all about"
2377.100,2378.400," you know what are you learn in Zen"
2379.500,2381.100," and the master thinks for Roman says well"
2382.000,2383.400," when I sit I sit"
2384.300,2385.100," when I stand"
2385.800,2386.400," I stand"
2387.200,2388.000," when I walk"
2389.100,2389.700," I walk"
2390.500,2391.300," when I arrived"
2392.300,2392.900," I arrived"
2394.600,2395.100," that's then"
2396.200,2398.700," and the guy the guy says well that's not"
2399.400,2400.100," big deal I mean"
2400.700,2401.100," I do that"
2401.800,2404.300," you know what's the big deal all these years of training and that's why you got"
2405.100,2407.200," and the master said no you don't do that"
2408.300,2410.100," when you sit you're already standing"
2411.100,2412.900," when you stand you're already walking"
2413.800,2416.300," when you walk you're already arriving and when you're arrived"
2416.900,2417.600," you're already leaving"
2419.600,2420.200," so I actually"
2421.300,2421.900," it is something"
2422.900,2426.200," you know to all of us from the the whatever"
2427.700,2429.900," unless you just come fresh From a monastery"
2430.100,2430.300," you know"
2431.100,2433.300," probably you've got some momentum of life"
2434.300,2436.800," in you and it very least the journey"
2438.200,2439.600," are getting here this morning"
2440.400,2441.500," and what's this going to be"
2442.300,2444.500," what's this strange English guy going to do with us"
2444.900,2446.700," you know what am I letting myself in for"
2447.500,2448.900," you know is it a cult you know"
2452.200,2456.900," is it going to be deeply uncomfortable am I going to get physical discomfort and emotional discomfort"
2460.200,2461.700," so there's an arriving process"
2462.300,2464.800," there's also then kind of mixed in with that somewhere"
2465.400,2466.100," the settling"
2467.200,2468.600," starting to settle it's like a"
2469.600,2471.600," glass of muddy water"
2472.300,2472.500," you know"
2473.400,2474.700," it's this is an old Taoist"
2475.000,2475.400," saying you know"
2476.000,2478.400," if the water is Muddy don't keep stirring it"
2479.600,2480.100," could it"
2480.700,2481.300," on the shelf"
2482.600,2483.500," and leave it"
2484.200,2485.300," just let it sit there"
2486.100,2489.200," and gradually gradually the silt will settle"
2489.900,2491.200," and the water will become clearer"
2492.400,2494.200," so there's we're engaged in that"
2495.000,2495.800," sometimes I feel"
2496.600,2499.300," it's almost like I can actually sense"
2500.100,2501.000," the silt"
2501.500,2502.000," in me"
2503.000,2503.700," sifting down"
2505.400,2506.200," and settling"
2507.000,2508.100," and something gets"
2509.300,2509.500," clearer"
2511.300,2512.500," that's part of the process"
2514.000,2515.700," and to help us actually"
2517.200,2519.000," in the arriving and the settling"
2519.700,2520.600," Luke who's a"
2521.200,2521.700," qigong"
2522.200,2523.700," master yoga teacher"
2524.500,2525.100," breathwork"
2526.300,2526.800," teacher"
2528.500,2529.600," mindfulness coach"
2530.400,2531.700," he's going to just help us a little bit"

2544.200,2545.700," movement whatever you think we need"
2550.000,2550.900," good morning everybody"

2554.500,2555.800," I'm I grew up here in DC"
2557.100,2561.500," it's nice to be in my home town I've lived in San Diego North in encinitas"
2562.100,2564.400," for almost almost 25 years now"
2565.100,2567.600," um and it's um DC has changed"
2569.000,2570.300," my life easier than I remember"
2571.500,2576.400," it's a joy to be here with you all I just want to invite any of you that are interested in"
2577.300,2578.500," theoretically standing up"
2579.100,2580.400," can we do that I know it's tight"
2583.000,2588.800," as you stand maybe just glanced over your left and right take a look in the eyes of your neighbor and just give them a little acknowledgement"
2590.000,2590.400," hello"
2592.200,2597.500," and I see some of you have shoes off some of you if she's on them I'm going to take my shoes off I just that's my personal preference"
2598.200,2599.300," but you know by all means"
2600.400,2602.200," and anything that you do in your shoes or"
2603.500,2607.400," with your feet on the floor just take a look down at your feet for a moments have your feet about his white as your hips"
2608.100,2610.400," do a little spreading open of your toes"
2610.800,2614.900," and note if you did that that your hands might have done the same so you can allow for that right"
2615.300,2618.400," just kind of like pulse that a few times it's gonna limp spread open"
2619.200,2622.900," and then relax open and relaxed and this is really just about you enjoying this"
2623.600,2625.700," vehicle of this body a minute"
2626.100,2629.400," and just check on your breath and please put your arms down by your sides close your eyes"
2630.300,2631.700," as long as you're comfortable doing that and if"
2632.400,2633.900," you prefer keeping them open then"
2634.400,2635.600," enjoy the view that way"
2636.500,2637.800," I feel your feet in the ground"
2639.200,2643.200," and in feeling your feet in the ground from your naval down since gravity"
2644.500,2647.800," like your feet are spreading into the floor and just do a little bit of a"
2648.200,2650.500," right and left sway weight goes into the right foot"
2651.300,2652.900," together what goes in the Left Foot"
2653.600,2656.600," your hands can go into your hips if you feel like you need any sense of"
2657.000,2660.500," stabilizing and that just might feel good to just to kind of move this way"
2660.800,2662.500," like a cat needing a pillow"
2663.100,2663.600," gently"
2664.700,2665.400," back and forth"
2668.400,2668.700," all right"
2669.700,2671.600," and then just go ahead and reach your arms up unless"
2672.300,2674.000," you have any complexities with shoulders"
2674.700,2679.000," or next step right and let all of the bones of your fingers extend"
2679.600,2684.100," but from your fingers through your skeletal system that all of your muscles feel"
2684.500,2685.700," down into your feet"
2686.100,2689.200," and notice what's happening with your breath and if your breath is gotten tight"
2689.800,2692.000," or stuck just let it gently begin to move"
2693.200,2698.200," and when I want you to do is just allow the weight of your arms to very slowly"
2698.800,2702.600," descend downwards and anyway that you want just feel this gravity"
2703.700,2704.300," from space"
2707.200,2707.600," really good"
2709.800,2711.800,"cool and then just a couple times turn your thumbs out"
2712.600,2714.700," and almost like your pinkie is kind of inwards"
2715.800,2719.400," I noticed this might let you do a little bit of a looking up at the ceiling"
2720.000,2723.400," good and then turn your thumbs in and back and your pinkies forward"
2723.900,2727.100," and this might let you drop forward a little bit so again from your feet now"
2727.500,2728.300," up through your hands"
2728.900,2731.300," up through your gaze look up and if your eyes were closely"
2731.700,2732.000," like"
2732.200,2733.600," they could open it might make a little easier"
2734.100,2735.900," and then exhale and like drop your head down"
2736.500,2737.200," don't get too far"
2737.700,2738.200," only get"
2738.400,2740.700," a to where it feels comfortable and just notice how that felt"
2742.200,2744.900," and then we'll do this very gentle thing very gentle"
2745.400,2746.900," begin to simply bend your knees"
2747.600,2747.700," right"
2748.400,2750.500," and we'll begin to move a little bit of pace and so"
2751.000,2755.200," ideally you do this without developing tension in the body but if it comes then it comes"
2755.900,2757.200," and then you can start to move a little quicker"
2758.200,2761.200," and the fun part about this is where breath begins to"
2761.800,2762.600," move from the"
2763.100,2764.600," feet all the way up through the body"
2765.000,2766.400," yeah you can already hear it in the room"
2767.100,2767.200," and"
2768.400,2772.600," let your face relax let your ears kind of dropside to side almost like a bobblehead"
2773.400,2776.500," right and then you'll hear how my breath starts to Stagger"
2777.000,2778.000," into the movements"
2778.400,2788.200," again if you observe tension or overdoing it or over efforting in your legs just fine he's there's no wrong way to do is you can get side to side if you feel uncomfortable doing this close your eyes"
2788.800,2791.200," no now that you're just in your own space of your body"
2791.800,2794.600," and just find the steadiness with breath"
2795.100,2797.700," it's smooth through your nose for five breath like this"
2802.500,2803.200," gentle good"
2807.300,2810.800," so you could also visualise and feel this from your feet up on the inhale"
2812.200,2814.800," and from the space and your head all the way back down on the Excel"
2815.800,2816.700," two more in"
2819.200,2822.800," out see if you can just do the even more soft with the inhale"
2825.100,2826.000," soft with the exhale"
2826.600,2829.400," keep this pattern going of in and out but in through your nose"
2831.100,2831.900," and then out through your mouth"
2833.600,2834.500," and then into your mouth"
2836.300,2837.100," and out through your nose"
2838.700,2841.400," and again it's not finest we'll do four more breaths in those"
2843.500,2844.000," hot mouth"
2845.700,2846.200," and mouth"
2848.600,2849.100," out nose"
2851.000,2852.300," and two more nose"
2854.500,2855.100," now"
2856.300,2857.300," really good now"
2859.700,2860.300," knows"
2861.100,2864.800," see how it feels to keep your body balancing and do three more breaths without sound"
2867.900,2869.000," and this might be a different"
2870.100,2872.300," touch of your breath into the space for your body"
2874.800,2877.000," and you might scan and observe where attention"
2878.000,2880.200," inevitably most often shows up"
2880.600,2881.500," face especially"
2882.900,2883.200," he's off"
2884.100,2885.000," do one more breath together"
2887.900,2889.100," and then breathe all the way out"
2890.500,2893.400," and then stop the bounds and again feel your feet"
2894.800,2898.800," and breathe from your feet the gravity under you this stability under us through the"
2899.300,2899.800," through the body"
2904.200,2905.900," and just do this again you can open the eyes"
2906.500,2907.900," if you breathe in turn your thumbs up"
2909.100,2911.800," and just kind of feel like lifting up the of the space of the heart"
2913.900,2916.800," and as you breathe out turn your thumbs down you think he's forward"
2917.500,2917.700," down"
2917.900,2919.100," a couple times right until like that"
2919.800,2921.700," so I'm almost like you using your hands"
2922.300,2925.500," to do this very gentle arching looking up"
2926.100,2930.800," lifting up your heart and then this rounding can let your chin drop your head be heavy"
2933.200,2933.400," good"
2934.300,2935.900," and then take your hands all the way up again"
2938.700,2945.700," and the same thing from the Fingertips all the way through the bones of your hands that all the muscles of your body just kind of droop down into your feet"
2947.100,2949.400," and then see how this feels turn your left thumb forward"
2950.300,2953.200," and grab the left pinky side of your hand with your right hand"
2953.800,2956.800," do a little bend in your left elbow a push with your left hand"
2957.500,2958.600," just a little bit of a lean"
2959.400,2961.900," and notice if the weight goes into the right foot with that feels like"
2962.500,2965.400," and then if it goes into the Left Foot with that feels like what happens to your breath"
2967.700,2969.000," draw your navel in on an exhale"
2970.700,2973.400," and then come all the way back up and switch so write them forward"
2974.400,2978.800," little bend in the right up we'll push the right hand and the left lean to the left waiting to the left foot"
2979.500,2985.200," waiting the right but just don't go too far you're too far would be where you're breathing gets defected and feels like it's Limited"
2986.900,2987.400," really good"
2988.300,2990.300," and go ahead and take your hands together-- like this"
2991.600,2993.900," and up to the sky just the stretch up like that"
2994.500,2997.100," good and see how it feels to grab opposite elbows overhead"
2997.600,2999.100," and turn to your turn to the"
3000.800,3001.300," windows"
3001.900,3004.100," those of you that are towards it doesn't matter which way I guess"
3005.000,3005.800," and then get the other way"
3007.800,3008.800," and then remember your feet"
3010.100,3012.100," and move from your fees you come back to the center"
3013.500,3016.200," and I like to do this this little thumb Hook"
3017.000,3019.300," pull your thumbs apart and try the other way"
3020.200,3021.900," good and then come out here in front of you"
3022.600,3023.400," see a little of this"
3024.600,3027.300," and just see how this feels to put your hands on your hips and just to kind of"
3027.900,3030.600," like kind of wag your tail and fold it into your growing"
3031.600,3032.300," good and"
3033.300,3037.200," just do a little bit of a touch for your limp so as long as this feels alright take your hands"
3037.800,3039.800," and find a little tapping at the backs of your knees"
3041.100,3042.600," and notice the sound will will"
3043.500,3046.900," co-ordinate in the room you can straighten out a little bit this will feel really nice"
3048.500,3048.900," then again"
3049.500,3049.700," cool"
3050.200,3052.300," and then you're gonna come to your groins and do the same thing"
3056.200,3056.500," awesome"
3057.700,3060.300," and then you're going to go to just below your collar bones"
3063.000,3063.400," you're good"
3064.100,3065.500," see a lot of smiles and this happens"
3065.800,3066.400," those"
3066.900,3071.000," things this is a five main areas of Limp so you might feel really good at the end of this"
3071.300,3072.900," go to your left armpit"

3277.400,3279.700," okay good so um"
3281.200,3284.400," yeah we're already in a slightly different place right"
3285.300,3286.300," friendly walked in"
3287.600,3289.000," when I we had this time together"
3289.800,3291.200," we were doing some arriving"
3292.000,3293.600," some movement with the body with Luke"
3294.200,3294.900," some sitting"
3296.200,3297.200," some engaging"
3298.400,3300.500," and we're just sort of just noting that"
3301.200,3303.000," it's not quite like it was when we came in"
3304.500,3305.400," you know this is um"
3306.400,3307.300," the practice"
3308.400,3308.800," you know the"
3309.900,3310.600," the process"
3311.000,3311.300," of"
3311.800,3312.300," training"
3313.200,3314.900," ourselves through meditation"
3315.900,3317.400," which is you know basically what"
3318.300,3319.300," what we're we're doing"
3320.000,3320.200," is"
3322.200,3323.800," the scenery changes as we go"
3324.400,3326.500," the way things feel changes we go"
3327.000,3327.800," and we're learning"
3328.400,3329.000," that actually"
3330.000,3332.900," how it feels to be experiencing life"
3333.700,3334.400," can change"
3335.800,3336.000," there's"
3336.400,3338.500," lots of different dimensions to it"
3339.300,3341.100," it's not just one thing we"
3342.100,3342.500," typically"
3343.100,3343.900," very easily"
3344.600,3348.200," kind of habituate ourselves condition us ourselves and get conditioned"
3348.700,3349.000," into"
3350.000,3350.300," very"
3351.000,3351.700," you know fairly sort of"
3352.400,3354.300," set channel of experiencing"
3355.500,3358.700," the way we think the world is and the way we experience it the world"
3359.400,3362.500," it's very easy to get conditioned into experiencing"
3362.900,3363.200," it"
3363.400,3364.400," one way"
3365.100,3366.000," but the reality"
3367.000,3367.200," that"
3368.200,3375.900," the wisdom traditions of all of various flavours of wisdom and tradition that there is that there are have been"
3376.800,3379.000," that one of the cool things that they've discovered"
3379.700,3382.700," is that actually there's a great spectrum"
3383.400,3385.100," of ways of experiences"
3386.200,3388.100," of like this very moment"
3389.100,3391.600," of being aware of this very moment"
3392.400,3392.800," that"
3394.400,3397.700," that awareness has multiple- possibilities"
3398.700,3400.300," it's not just one way"
3401.600,3405.100," and and the heart of what meditation is about"
3405.600,3406.600," is expanding"
3407.300,3408.300," our sort of menu"
3409.100,3413.700," of ways of experiencing are repertoire of ways of just experiencing"
3414.400,3414.900," life"
3415.700,3416.800," because there's so many"
3417.400,3419.100," Waze is not just"
3420.200,3422.100," one thing that human consciousness is"
3422.800,3423.000," no"
3423.800,3424.400," can have a coffee"
3427.000,3427.800," I want another way"
3429.400,3430.200," thanks a lot okay"
3433.500,3433.800," so you know"
3435.100,3439.600," it's it's very cool actually that this is a possibility for us because"
3440.200,3443.400," we're so habituated to think in that if we want any change"
3443.900,3444.900," it's got to be outside"
3445.800,3446.100," we got a"
3446.600,3449.800," effect change externally to get some"
3450.500,3451.500," inward change"
3452.400,3454.900," with so you know what I mean we're so conditioned to like"
3455.400,3457.600," as I was saying before the a to b model is a"
3458.000,3458.700," if I want"
3459.600,3459.700," to"
3461.300,3464.500," feel an experience my life in a different way"
3465.200,3466.500," it's gonna be because"
3467.300,3468.000," I basically"
3468.700,3469.900," adjust things out there"
3472.100,3474.000," and it's very understandable"
3474.900,3479.600," that we think that and operate that way because we've been taught that from the start"
3481.200,3481.300," and"
3481.800,3482.200," basically"
3483.300,3484.000," is wrong"
3485.300,3486.800," it's actually wrong"
3487.800,3488.900," is incorrect"
3490.800,3492.000," the number one way"
3492.400,3493.300," of experiencing"
3494.300,3494.700," things"
3495.400,3497.000," differently of experiencing"
3498.700,3502.400," things in the way that we might really want in order to be fulfilled"
3503.100,3504.400," and more at peace"
3504.800,3506.900," and actually have more Joe"
3508.700,3511.400," and have more gratitude and have more"
3512.000,3512.900," Tenderness"
3514.200,3516.700," and you know of course yes more love"
3518.500,3518.900," is"
3520.100,3522.300," not really out there"
3523.200,3524.700," it's actually in here"
3526.200,3527.000," it's about"
3529.300,3530.300," finding what"
3532.100,3534.800," what the possibilities are that have been here"
3536.200,3537.200," from the start"
3539.000,3541.000," and you know we we we we kind of"
3542.200,3542.800," hear this"
3543.700,3543.900," in"
3544.400,3544.600," many"
3545.300,3546.900," traditions in the Buddhism"
3548.600,3551.600," some say it can be summed up in two words"
3552.800,3553.300," dott"
3554.500,3555.100," and C"
3556.700,3557.100," stop"
3558.400,3559.000," and see"
3562.300,3562.700," and then in"
3564.000,3566.500," the abrahamic world of spirituality"
3567.200,3567.600," there's something"
3568.200,3569.300," really quite similar"
3570.400,3571.000," be still"
3572.400,3573.400," and no"
3577.000,3578.200," very similar really"
3578.400,3578.800," stop"
3580.100,3580.600," and be still"
3583.300,3583.600," see"
3585.300,3585.800," and no"
3589.800,3590.500," I find that just"
3590.900,3591.300," amazing"
3592.300,3592.400," that"
3593.100,3593.800," there could be such"
3596.100,3598.500," a great sort of wealth waiting for us"
3599.500,3600.200," if we just stop"
3602.500,3602.700," you know"
3604.900,3607.600," and again it's goes it goes against the grain"
3608.400,3611.800," because I've got 83 damn problems I got to fix you"
3612.400,3612.600," right"
3613.800,3615.400," but that 84th one"
3615.700,3616.900," is always right here"
3618.800,3619.000," that"
3619.700,3620.600," what if I'll never"
3621.000,3623.000," what is the I'm going to die with the inbox"
3624.100,3624.700," full you know"
3627.400,3628.000," and actually"
3629.700,3630.300," that's okay"
3631.900,3632.200," and the"
3633.300,3634.000," the sort of"
3635.300,3636.300," the solution"
3637.600,3641.800," I mean that's the that's the the wonder of all this wisdom"
3642.600,3642.900," is that"
3643.500,3645.700," there's that there is a kind of solution"
3647.700,3650.500," to our Human Nature to our human condition"
3651.600,3652.300," in a we"
3653.400,3656.000," it's been spoken about you know for"
3656.400,3657.200," thousands of years"
3659.600,3660.600," we don't really know how long"
3662.100,3664.000," some some people think that"
3665.900,3667.700," the discoveries of meditation"
3668.800,3670.800," about the nature of consciousness essentially"
3673.100,3675.400," we're starting to be discovered in the pally"
3676.500,3676.800," I mean that means"
3677.200,3677.900," pre"
3678.200,3679.200," 10,000 years ago"
3680.400,3682.800," that in the shamanic world that"
3683.400,3684.900," the oldest religion is shamanism"
3685.400,3685.900," you know and"
3686.700,3688.200," so they say of humanity"
3688.700,3689.900," they could have started"
3690.600,3693.800," with sapiens 300,000 years ago in the when I really know"
3694.600,3695.600," but you know let's"
3696.000,3696.400," possibly"
3698.400,3699.900," some kind of exploration"
3700.700,3703.800," of the territory of consciousness is being going on"
3704.900,3707.600," maybe you know 100,000 years how many"
3708.900,3712.600," divide that by what I have to buy them by 20"
3713.800,3715.500," hundred thousand ten thousand"
3716.800,3718.300," 5000 generations"
3719.000,3719.100," maybe"
3720.000,3720.200," you know"
3720.800,3721.100," roughly"
3722.900,3724.800," maybe more you know who knows but"
3727.600,3729.000," the wisdom that"
3729.400,3729.600," that"
3731.200,3733.200," cat that we can uncover"
3734.100,3736.000," with those two words stop"
3737.900,3738.200," and see"
3741.000,3741.600," be still"
3743.100,3743.500," and know"
3747.500,3749.300," and you know of course is always"
3751.000,3753.000," not something we're about to do"
3754.300,3754.900," it can't be"
3755.400,3756.900," it can't be something we're gonna do"
3759.900,3760.000," because"
3760.700,3761.700," because that"
3762.000,3763.700," actually is a fantasy"
3764.300,3765.100," it's now"
3766.300,3768.700," it's not like I get it I'm going to do some stopping"
3769.100,3769.600," in a little bit"
3771.100,3772.300," and then I'll do some seeing you know"
3772.800,3773.600," that's it's actually"
3774.500,3774.900," only"
3776.700,3778.200," it only applies to now"
3779.500,3780.400," you know to stop"
3781.200,3781.900," includes"
3782.700,3783.100," stopping"
3784.300,3785.700," that I'm gonna do it"
3786.700,3787.100," now it's actually"
3788.100,3788.500," ah"
3788.800,3789.500," it's already happening"
3791.300,3791.500," here"
3794.600,3795.500," I sometimes think that"
3796.600,3796.900," the"
3799.200,3801.000," really the only teaching"
3802.400,3804.200," the only teaching is"
3806.100,3806.300," this"
3807.400,3807.900," this moment"
3809.200,3811.100," but all elaborate"
3811.200,3811.900," you know there's"
3813.000,3813.700," I don't know how many"
3814.500,3816.600," millions of words there are"
3817.200,3818.700," in the Buddhist tradition and"
3819.400,3822.400," in the abrahamic traditions with all their commentaries as"
3823.100,3823.200," you know"
3823.700,3825.100," millions upon millions of words"
3826.000,3826.900," and in Hinduism"
3827.500,3829.100," you know all of Vader's and the"
3829.600,3832.400," Acres and acres of commentary upon the Vader's you know"
3833.200,3833.600," but actually"
3834.600,3836.400," really the only teaching"
3836.800,3838.300," is is just now"
3839.400,3839.600," this"
3842.700,3844.400," because because this is what there is"
3845.400,3847.100," this moment is what there is"
3849.100,3851.100," and if we if we just get that"
3852.400,3853.800," you know we're we're kind of"
3854.200,3855.400," it's one and done you know"
3856.700,3857.300," this is it"
3857.800,3858.000," this"
3858.500,3861.500," and actually the great Vietnamese Zen master tic that h"
3862.200,3864.100," you know he he used to have on"
3865.100,3867.900," on his altars in his centres"
3868.600,3870.200," and we're traditionally there be"
3870.700,3871.400," a Buddha"
3871.500,3872.700," you know the emblem of"
3873.700,3874.600," the Buddhist world"
3875.000,3876.400," the Buddha sitting there you know"
3876.900,3877.700," in meditation"
3878.400,3880.200," he would have a calligraphy"
3880.800,3882.400," in English that just said"
3883.000,3883.200," this"
3884.000,3884.300," is"
3885.000,3885.300," it"
3893.800,3894.100," excuse me"
3894.600,3897.400," I'm so okay I want to tell you just a little bit about"
3898.300,3900.700," the way that I've come to"
3901.900,3902.700," sort of"
3903.800,3907.600," encourage encourage people who are interested in learning meditation"
3909.900,3912.200," which is expressed in my new book original love"
3912.600,3918.100," and it's also expressed in the app the way by the way anybody here using the way could you put up a hand"
3919.100,3921.300," oh my gosh great okay"
3922.900,3927.100," wow actually I should ask that again and take a photo and send it to my nephew Jack"
3928.100,3929.500," Jack's the CEO of the way"
3930.200,3936.300," brilliant young guy well thank you for thank you for picking it up I hope you're finding it helpful and do give us feedback by the way"
3936.500,3936.800," if you're"
3937.600,3937.800," yeah"
3938.100,3938.300," you know"
3939.100,3942.600," yeah didn't like that one Henry you know you okay let us know"
3943.200,3943.400," um"
3945.900,3947.600," but let me just I really want to just"
3948.800,3949.700," yeah just tell it"
3950.800,3952.400," tell me a little bit about about"
3952.900,3954.800," how I come to think"
3955.100,3956.100," one can share this"
3957.100,3958.500," is practices most effectively"
3958.900,3959.400," and why"
3961.500,3967.300," and actually I'm just thinking before I do that I'm going to just I I'm sorry I didn't do this earlier just to let you know"
3968.000,3969.200," what you're actually in for this"
3969.800,3970.700," in this three day thing"
3971.400,3974.200," you already experiencing it it's going to be a mixture of"
3976.500,3977.400," of some sitting"
3978.400,3979.600," some of which will be guided"
3980.400,3983.200," and they'll also be times of more quiet"
3983.600,3984.600," more silence together"
3986.100,3988.200," and when I say sitting I guess you know I mean meditation"
3989.400,3993.200," they'll be some actually Q and A Certain points"
3993.600,3994.100," I'll"
3994.700,3997.200," shoot my mouth off a bit here and there like I'm doing now"
3998.000,4001.400," and they'll be chances for you to connect with one another"
4002.500,4004.900," um in in the room in our sessions"
4005.500,4005.600," just"
4006.200,4009.700," a bit and pieces like that we'll have sometimes some topics that you can"
4010.600,4012.000," exchange views on"
4013.100,4013.200," and"
4014.800,4015.600," they'll be movement"
4016.100,4017.400," here is from Luke now and then"
4018.700,4018.900," and"
4020.900,4023.800," that's basically it when we're in session"
4024.400,4025.200," we have a long"
4026.100,4028.800," lunch break you know so it's a fairly light schedule"
4029.600,4033.200," for those who are used to intensive meditation retreats"
4034.100,4036.600," where you start a 5 a.m. and go to 9:00 p.m."
4037.500,4038.800," at we're just 10 to 4"
4041.200,4045.700," I don't remember once in I went to a Zen Retreat there was absolutely Revolution"
4046.500,4047.200," because instead of being"
4047.700,4048.100," five"
4048.700,4049.100," to nine"
4050.100,4051.100," 5 a.m. to 9:00 p.m."
4051.500,4052.300," it was 95"
4052.800,4053.900," we also"
4055.300,4056.800," we also that was fantastically"
4057.800,4061.300," crazily risky Wild and Free you know"
4062.200,4063.700," but this is 10 to 4 you know"
4064.900,4066.400," and two hours in the middle"
4066.900,4068.600," so we can Wonder out and get some lunch"
4069.700,4071.500," and also so that you can mingle"
4071.900,4072.200," because"
4073.400,4074.600," especially with that number of you"
4074.900,4076.200," using the way you know"
4077.000,4078.600," you can you can connect and"
4079.600,4081.500," and you know we're actually hoping"
4082.400,4083.200," well we're going to be"
4084.500,4087.700," creating more ways that people who are using the way can connect with one another"
4088.400,4090.400," by time zone by location and so on"
4090.800,4091.300," if they want to"
4092.300,4095.200," huddle form little pods that can meet now and then so on"
4096.800,4098.500," that's basically what we're in for"
4099.500,4101.700," I Believe in a lighter schedule"
4103.200,4105.100," because I think you can digest it more easily"
4105.900,4108.000," so you've got the evening to just be sort of"
4108.500,4109.600," doing whatever you do but"
4110.500,4112.800," somehow the time together is working in in US"
4113.600,4114.500," and you got the early morning"
4115.300,4116.400," some of you might like to sit"
4117.200,4118.300," you know before you come in or"
4118.900,4120.100," you know it's again it's"
4120.600,4123.200," the time together is working on us"
4123.800,4124.600," when we're not together"
4125.000,4125.000," so"
4125.700,4127.400," I think it actually can be more effective"
4128.100,4128.700," even though"
4129.600,4130.400," for a decade"
4131.200,4131.700," and more"
4132.500,4135.600," I've been teaching very intensive meditation retreats"
4135.900,4136.600," that's what I was doing"
4137.500,4140.900," you know that was I gave my life to it for a decade completely I mean"
4141.600,4142.500," well and my family but"
4143.000,4147.000," going to places and running a Center mounting cloud zen center in New Mexico"
4147.600,4149.700," and it was there to do intensive meditation"
4150.200,4151.900," and when I go I go to Germany"
4152.900,4153.100," and"
4155.100,4156.100," no sightseeing"
4156.800,4158.100," straight into the center"
4158.800,4159.300," and just"
4160.400,4161.300," five to nine"
4162.100,4163.100," 5:00 a.m. 9 p.m."
4163.500,4164.100," because I actually"
4165.100,4170.800," that was that was the way I was taught and trained and I believed in it and I still do actually it's a very powerful way"
4171.300,4173.000," of shifting human"
4173.500,4175.200," experiences opening us up"
4175.800,4177.100," but it's not the only way"
4178.200,4180.400," and so what I've come to"
4181.400,4182.100," realise"
4182.700,4183.100," slowly"
4183.800,4186.200," I'm going to slow learner is that there's another way"
4186.600,4188.100," and I'm going to read you a little bit from this book"
4188.800,4191.600," about how I really got that when I was in my"
4192.400,4193.900," mid early thirties I was"
4194.900,4199.700," I started young as a writer and I lived full-time as a writer for quite a while actually and"
4200.500,4202.100," at a certain point I was doing a"
4203.800,4207.100," I had a writing assignment in South America which I often did and"
4207.400,4209.900," this one was in Venezuela and at the end of doing the assignment"
4210.700,4215.800," I had also a book to write with for a publisher that I had already signed a contract for and"
4216.800,4219.000," I had six weeks free and I went to this little"
4219.900,4223.300," village on the North coast of Venezuela called Santa Fe"
4223.900,4226.200," and actually the book I was writing was about New Mexico"
4227.000,4233.200," called Savage pilgrims if anyone's interested and which has Santa Fe in it and I saw this little fishing village called Santa venator"
4233.400,4235.500," I've been really having a hard time writing and I thought"
4235.700,4237.100," I know I'll go to Santa Fe"
4237.600,4239.700," Venezuela to write about Santa Fe New Mexico"
4240.400,4241.400," and I actually didn't really work"
4241.800,4246.500," but I had a nice time there because in every evening I went out onto the beach"
4248.000,4249.800," to do my evening meditation"
4250.800,4251.500," and you know"
4251.900,4254.900," I dig up a little heap of sand and sit on it like a cushion"
4255.600,4258.300," I was a little bit self-conscious but I found a quiet"
4258.700,4261.000," it was a very quiet little fishing village and"
4263.000,4266.500," and I just found a quiet corner near some palm trees and just sat there"
4267.200,4267.600," and then"
4268.800,4273.600," the second evening I was there I heard these voices going out senor senor"
4274.400,4276.300," and I see them there were calling somebody and they"
4277.400,4281.800," called again senior and I looked up and then there were three boys in tattoo shorts"
4282.200,4283.000," looking at me saying"
4283.500,4283.900," what are you doing"
4285.400,4285.600," and"
4286.200,4287.300," and I said well"
4287.800,4289.000," actually I'm meditating"
4290.100,4291.600," what's that when you just sit still"
4292.600,4293.400," can we do"
4293.800,4293.800," it"
4294.700,4295.800," so I showed them"
4297.300,4299.200," how to do it just to have a little"
4299.600,4300.800," sort of heap of Santa sit on"
4301.700,4302.500," hands in a"
4304.100,4305.100," lap body upright"
4306.300,4307.000," counting breaths"
4308.100,4308.200," and"
4309.300,4309.900," I kind of thought"
4310.600,4311.900," little I was a little sort of"
4312.200,4315.300," you know I hope that I hope they're okay you know and I timed it I said"
4315.700,4316.800," we'll just do five minutes"
4317.500,4318.400," and we did five minutes"
4319.600,4321.200," and I said that was five minutes well done"
4322.300,4323.100," can we do some more"
4324.400,4325.700," okay we'll do another five minutes"
4326.500,4327.000," and that's enough"
4328.100,4328.200," and"
4329.000,4329.200," and"
4330.100,4331.800," actually they started coming every evening"
4332.900,4336.700," and and even one evening I didn't go"
4337.600,4341.000," and the next morning they were around at my hotel rooms where were you last night you know"
4342.400,4346.400," and it became a thing the whole time I was there every evening this little meditation"
4346.700,4347.600," thing happened and"
4348.400,4351.400," that bring other friends sometimes their parents came one of the kids up to"
4352.000,4353.600," who's this weird guy what's going on you know"
4354.900,4355.000," and"
4356.100,4362.900," it was actually really nice and what I realised well I'm going to read you a little bit from the book about this I took to dip"
4363.900,4364.800," um"
4367.100,4367.900," yeah whenever"
4369.600,4372.200," there was someone new I went over the instructions again"
4373.500,4377.300," and in the other seemed to listen in happily enough I realised"
4378.300,4379.500," it was actually nice"
4380.300,4380.700," to feel"
4381.300,4382.000," like a beginner"
4382.800,4383.200," again"
4383.800,4384.200," and again"
4384.900,4385.600," because you know I thought"
4386.500,4386.900," some of them"
4387.400,4389.600," if somebody knew came I had to give the instructions"
4389.900,4390.100," again"
4390.900,4396.100," and I thought well that's a problem because all those adept or whatever their skilled already they don't need to hit"
4396.700,4399.100," they don't need to hear again but they liked hearing it"
4401.100,4401.400," again um"
4402.300,4403.400," it freed"
4403.900,4405.700," my companions and me"
4406.300,4407.400," of any sense"
4407.900,4410.300," we ought to be getting better at it"
4412.100,4412.800," every time"
4413.500,4415.700," it could be as if we'd never done it before"
4417.300,4421.000," and actually one very common strange"
4422.000,4422.400," symptoms"
4423.300,4425.100," in meditation practice is"
4425.800,4426.800," performance anxiety"
4428.200,4429.200," people get nervous"
4430.100,4431.300," I I know it well"
4432.100,4433.600," oh my god am I doing it right"
4434.300,4435.300," am I doing it right you know"
4437.000,4438.800," really the whole thing"
4439.800,4441.800," is that you can't do it wrong"
4443.800,4450.800," I thought back to the daunting or steer practice I've done at the Zen monastery where a trained the atmosphere there have been underlying"
4451.200,4452.500," undeniably powerful but"
4453.000,4454.000," intimidating"
4454.700,4455.200," as well"
4455.800,4456.900," no one made a sound"
4457.300,4459.700," no one moved actually they had monitors"
4460.500,4461.900," you sat in these rows"
4462.800,4463.500," facing the war"
4464.000,4466.300," either side in the maybe three rows or something"
4467.800,4470.100," either side and at the end of each row there was somebody"
4470.600,4473.000," who didn't sit that way they sat looking down the road"
4473.900,4478.900," to see if anyone moved and if you did that bark at you don't move"
4480.400,4480.400," and"
4481.300,4483.100," and and and and you couldn't even"
4484.500,4485.900," you know if you had a"
4486.400,4487.000," sniffle"
4488.000,4490.300," forget pulling out a tissue"
4491.100,4492.200," no no no let it run"
4492.900,4493.600," let's shout you know"
4494.700,4494.800," and"
4496.100,4496.800," it was scary"
4499.200,4499.600," I mean I"
4501.000,4505.400," I don't want to knock it actually because I think that there's a lot of pedagogies"
4506.000,4507.400," a lot of ways of"
4508.700,4510.300," helping us humans learn stuff"
4510.700,4512.100," including learning how to be"
4512.800,4514.400," with a more open consciousness"
4515.000,4517.500," and that may well be an effective one"
4518.300,4520.200," but it's definitely not the only one"
4520.700,4522.000," it can be much gentler"
4522.700,4523.800," and kinda you know"
4524.600,4524.600," so"
4526.600,4528.400," this sitting here on the beach"
4529.200,4529.900," in the evening"
4530.500,4531.900," was basically the same"
4533.000,4533.600," sitting"
4534.500,4535.600," but if felt so different"
4537.400,4538.500," there was an ease"
4538.900,4539.500," in the air"
4540.400,4544.100," whatever little huddle of us it might be sitting there by The Quiet Bay"
4544.800,4545.900," under the palm trees"
4546.700,4547.300," as the light"
4547.800,4548.600," dissolved"
4549.500,4550.500," we were there only"
4551.100,4551.700," to rest"
4552.900,4554.200," to unwind"
4555.700,4557.800," we made no demands on ourselves"
4559.600,4560.100," we were just"
4561.100,4561.500," being"
4564.000,4565.800," as day gave way to night"
4566.900,4567.300," so we"
4568.200,4568.700," gave way"
4569.900,4570.600," to being"
4572.500,4573.700," we slip loose"
4575.000,4576.700," from whatever agenda we might have had"
4577.300,4578.400," and let the evening"
4579.300,4580.300," Hold Us"
4583.100,4584.300," in years to come I often"
4584.900,4587.200," thought about sitting on that beach with those young people"
4587.700,4590.400," after completing years of rigorous and training and"
4591.300,4594.900," practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction and other mindfulness systems"
4595.500,4602.800," and taking a deep dive into absorption training that's the whole other thing I remembered that time on a beach in Venezuela"
4603.400,4605.700," with young people looking for a simple way"
4606.400,4607.100," to appreciate"
4608.000,4608.800," the fading"
4609.400,4610.100," of each day"
4612.100,4615.300," in occurred to me that in all the practices I had done"
4615.900,4617.700," there was a common ground"
4619.900,4620.600," in all of them"
4621.900,4623.000," there was a kind of bedrock"
4624.300,4625.200," they would bring you to"
4626.500,4627.400," which was all ways"
4628.000,4628.200," about"
4629.200,4629.800," he's"
4631.500,4632.300," not trying"
4633.100,4634.000," Not striving"
4634.900,4636.400," but knowing in your bones"
4637.400,4639.700," that at some deeper level of your being"
4640.400,4642.500," as some deeper level of your being all"
4643.100,4643.500," as well"
4645.100,4646.400," and when I'm inquired further"
4647.200,4648.600," as to what that wellness"
4649.300,4651.800," was about and why it was there the answer"
4652.400,4653.200," always came back"
4653.700,4655.300," the same whatever the practice"
4655.900,4658.600," whatever the time or place in which we did it"
4659.200,4660.700," what each practice"
4661.300,4662.500," could uncover"
4663.400,4663.900," was love"
4665.000,4665.300," love"
4666.400,4668.600," for Life love love self"
4669.200,4670.100," love for others"
4670.800,4671.100," love"
4671.900,4673.600," for this world love was"
4674.500,4675.100," the bassist"
4680.500,4680.800," so yeah"
4683.400,4683.900," there's a"
4686.200,4690.900," there's a there's a there's an old Chinese document which is actually kind of the the fundamental"
4691.700,4694.800," thing actually sort of thing behind this book originally love which says"
4695.700,4695.800," that"
4696.200,4697.900," the path of practice is a cart"
4699.400,4699.900," track with two"
4700.700,4701.400," wheel tracks"
4702.900,4704.100," the first Wheel track"
4705.000,4705.900," is called"
4707.100,4708.200," foundations of mindfulness"
4709.000,4710.400," and I explain what that is in a second"
4711.000,4711.800," the second one"
4712.300,4712.800," is called"
4714.200,4714.800," principal"
4715.000,4716.000," and I explained what that is in"
4716.900,4716.900," so"
4717.500,4719.600," the first Wheel track and this is this is"
4720.800,4723.500," it may sound a little complex but it's actually really simple"
4724.600,4725.300," first wheel"
4726.800,4728.100," track the foundations of mindfulness"
4728.800,4731.100," is a Path of gradually"
4731.600,4732.400," developing"
4733.600,4735.100," a gradually becoming"
4736.000,4736.400," more"
4737.000,4738.500," mindfully aware"
4739.200,4740.100," more aware"
4740.500,4742.600," in the moment and it's a gradual training"
4743.400,4746.000," now and this thing learned this thing learn this thing"
4746.400,4747.200," and gradually"
4747.800,4750.300," building up the capacity to stay aware"
4751.200,4751.700," in the moment"
4752.900,4755.900," so that at any time even when we busy we can stop"
4756.300,4756.600," and see"
4758.700,4761.000," and the other path the other track"
4761.800,4762.900," the other Wheel track"
4764.500,4765.300," principal"
4766.400,4771.000," is a is an old Taoist term so it's not very helpful for us actually"
4772.200,4773.000," what it means"
4774.000,4774.500," is that"
4775.600,4776.000," that"
4777.000,4778.800," love I was just reading about"
4781.000,4782.000," or we could call it"
4783.300,4784.400," a great Ocean"
4785.400,4785.600," of"
4786.000,4786.300," peace"
4787.900,4788.700," or we could call it"
4789.200,4790.100," original nature"
4792.700,4793.500," the"
4795.500,4800.000," some dimension or set of dimensions of our very own consciousness"
4800.700,4801.500," some level"
4802.300,4804.100," of our very own awareness Here and Now"
4804.700,4806.000," there's always present"
4806.800,4808.900," that you don't need to cultivate"
4809.900,4812.100," you don't need to get better at it"
4812.400,4813.500," because it's already here"
4815.600,4817.600," so this is kind of the most important thing I should actually"
4818.200,4818.500," is this"
4818.900,4820.600," this idea that there's sort of two"
4821.700,4822.200," parts"
4824.300,4825.500," there's one path"
4826.000,4827.400," that isn't a path"
4827.800,4829.200," because it's already here"
4832.400,4833.300," and what is already here"
4834.200,4837.300," is is it like I said shift in the angle of light"
4838.200,4838.700," it's a"
4839.000,4840.300," shift in"
4842.800,4843.500," experienced"
4844.200,4844.500," right"
4845.000,4847.200," now so suddenly"
4847.900,4852.100," in the midst of experiencing things just as we are asked together"
4852.800,4853.400," in a room"
4854.200,4855.000," this guy talking"
4855.800,4858.700," light outside city outside trees outside"
4859.700,4861.600," air in the room sound of the AC"
4862.200,4863.700," in the midst of all of this"
4865.100,4866.700," actually at the same time"
4867.900,4868.600," right now"
4869.100,4869.400," here"
4870.200,4870.700," there is"
4871.300,4871.900," the presence"
4872.900,4873.100," of"
4874.000,4875.000," a boundlessness"
4876.300,4877.200," or something without"
4877.700,4878.300," time"
4879.200,4879.400," without"
4880.000,4881.000," known space"
4882.200,4883.100," to order unable"
4885.000,4885.800," but it's here right now"
4888.500,4891.000," and it doesn't matter what we're doing it's always present"
4892.300,4893.400," and that's the principle"
4894.100,4895.600," that's what's known as"
4896.400,4897.100," Awakening"
4897.700,4898.500," in Buddhism"
4899.400,4900.300," to discover that"
4900.900,4901.700," that which is"
4902.200,4903.000," never gone"
4903.600,4905.100," that was cannot come and go"
4905.800,4906.300," that which"
4907.100,4909.500," it's a kind of universal healing"
4910.500,4913.200," because it takes away all our need for things to be different"
4916.400,4918.500," because there's that's always present that's"
4919.900,4921.000," one of those wheel tracks"
4922.600,4923.300," the other one"
4924.000,4927.700," is the more sort of in a sense more merciful almost"
4928.500,4929.900," it says yeah but we're human"
4930.700,4933.900," we need to gradually help ourselves"
4934.600,4937.200," I need methods I need tools I need"
4937.800,4938.500," I need"
4940.100,4945.300," tricks and skills and you know I need a little toolkit a quiver the things I can do to help myself"
4946.000,4948.000," if I'm in if I'm having a really hard time"
4948.600,4951.200," don't tell me that there's something boundless and wonderful present"
4951.500,4952.300," help me you know"
4953.000,4956.300," and I need something to help me so yeah we got a lot of things we can do"
4957.200,4957.800," we can start"
4958.300,4958.600," sort of"
4959.500,4961.100," getting to be aware"
4961.700,4961.900," of"
4962.400,4963.900," when there's difficult in Motion"
4965.000,4966.000," what actually is it"
4966.500,4967.600," it's something in here"
4968.500,4969.600," yeah that'd be a lot of thoughts"
4970.100,4971.100," often coming with it"
4971.700,4972.600," talk in the mind"
4972.900,4973.800," images in the mind"
4975.400,4976.500," and we can track that as well"
4977.400,4978.500," but they'll also be"
4979.300,4981.000," an uncomfortable miss"
4982.000,4984.300," somewhere in chest or diaphragm usually"
4984.900,4986.900," the research actually with anxiety is that"
4987.400,4989.500," 94% of people feel it in the chest"
4990.500,4992.900," and six percent just below the chest"
4994.100,4997.900," so we're probably going to fall in that range throat down to diaphragm"
4998.700,5001.400," and we can feel the uncomfortable this"
5002.500,5003.200," and the"
5004.400,5006.000," the beauty of"
5007.600,5008.000," um"
5008.600,5010.200," I've meditation actually"
5011.100,5011.500," is that"
5012.200,5014.200," in all cases really we're learning"
5015.200,5018.000," not how to switch something we don't want"
5018.600,5018.800," off"
5020.000,5020.900," not how to"
5021.300,5023.000," have a difficult emotion like anxiety"
5023.800,5024.800," and get rid of it"
5026.200,5027.000," that in fact"
5027.700,5027.900," is"
5029.400,5031.300," gonna only intensify it"
5031.500,5031.900," typically"
5033.300,5037.400," the wisdom in the path of meditation at least as I've come to understand it"
5038.000,5039.800," is totally counterintuitive"
5041.000,5042.400," it's actually in"
5044.300,5045.500," that 84th problem"
5046.700,5048.600," so that if there's an uncomfortable emotion"
5049.400,5051.500," of course I don't want to feel it it's uncomfortable"
5053.800,5055.600," but actually the path"
5056.100,5057.200," is to Let It Be There"
5057.900,5060.100," the path is to learn to allow it"
5061.300,5062.200," it is to release"
5063.200,5063.700," the resistance"
5067.300,5067.900," so that's"
5071.300,5076.200," that's the actually as a listed in the first Wheel track is learning"
5077.000,5078.600," that we have the capacity to"
5079.200,5081.300," to welcome more of our life"
5082.100,5083.400," than we sort of think we do"
5084.300,5084.400," you know"
5088.400,5089.800," and then the second Wheel track"
5090.400,5095.000," is that they're truly is and it's it's important to stay because they're truly is"
5096.000,5097.500," sort of another"
5098.600,5099.200," dimension"
5100.600,5102.200," very experienced Here and Now"
5103.200,5103.700," there is"
5104.500,5105.000," Limitless"
5106.500,5108.400," you know and now we we're and we're all"
5108.900,5110.000," part of it and we can all"
5110.600,5113.200," find it actually at any time and sometimes"
5113.900,5115.900," meditation practice helps us to find it"
5116.400,5117.200," and sometimes it doesn't"
5117.800,5119.500," you know because sometimes people find it"
5120.000,5123.100," when they're lifting a bag of groceries out of the back seat of the car"
5123.700,5124.900," they're just leaning in and"
5125.400,5126.300," Bam all of a sudden"
5126.800,5129.000," you know the yoga teacher Stephen cope"
5129.800,5133.200," to us about a time he was 21 years old he was painting a house he was up a ladder"
5133.900,5135.900," painting a clabbered house"
5136.600,5137.400," with white paint"
5138.000,5140.300," and all of a sudden just add a nowhere"
5140.900,5143.400," he just suddenly got this overwhelming sense"
5144.100,5145.100," that he was part of everything"
5146.600,5150.600," you know and that's principle is the sudden Discovery"
5151.400,5153.000," the coal construction"
5153.800,5157.500," that I always made but I'm in here and everything else is out there"
5158.100,5159.100," and I'm separate"
5159.500,5160.200," from everything else"
5160.800,5161.800," that construction"
5162.500,5163.800," is only a construction"
5164.700,5166.400," is only an idea in my mind"
5167.100,5167.700," and actually"
5168.300,5169.200," if we see that"
5169.700,5170.200," we see"
5171.600,5173.100," a radical alternative"
5173.600,5174.300," situation"
5174.800,5176.000," which is that we're part of everything"
5176.800,5178.200," that we're not separate"
5179.100,5181.900," the discovery of a non separate nest"
5182.400,5185.700," and it's and anybody who's tasted it knows"
5186.200,5187.600," somehow knows in their bones"
5188.200,5188.700," is true"
5189.400,5191.000," it's real when we taste it"
5191.600,5194.300," we tend to get this overpowering sense"
5195.600,5197.600," that is actually more real"
5198.900,5201.900," than our ordinary construction of reality"
5203.400,5206.100," so this is I wanted to say again I feel it's the most important thing"
5206.800,5208.400," that I'm going to have to say this weekend"
5208.900,5209.900," is that"
5210.300,5211.100," is real"
5211.800,5216.300," the reality of non separatists of their being a level of our very life"
5217.000,5219.000," that is inseparable from all else"
5219.800,5220.800," that's real"
5221.400,5223.100," and it's not a fanciful"
5225.300,5228.200," doctrine or something it's a human experience"
5228.600,5229.500," that's reported"
5230.100,5232.300," not commonly but not uncommonly"
5232.500,5232.800," either"
5233.300,5234.900," and both from the world of"
5236.000,5238.500," people meditating is the usual place people get it"
5239.300,5241.700," I know nowadays there's some psychedelic"
5242.800,5243.900," glimpses of it that can happen"
5244.700,5245.300," and then there's"
5246.100,5250.700," everything else all in real life people get it they suddenly get hit by Thomas Merton"
5251.100,5253.100," was walking down the street in Louisville Kentucky"
5253.600,5256.100," and he suddenly saw everybody was part of one great light"
5256.600,5258.600," or something like that there's different ways it'll show up"
5259.200,5261.400," but the same thing that would no nan"
5261.800,5262.700," separate nest"
5263.300,5265.000," and each of us is"
5266.600,5267.000," this is"
5267.800,5270.400," is it holographic each of us is the whole"
5271.400,5273.200," each of us is all things you know"
5273.700,5274.300," and actually"
5276.200,5276.600," I'm going"
5277.400,5278.300," I'm too weird"
5278.700,5280.700," too Fast Too Deep let's do that"
5283.100,5283.500," I was gonna"
5284.300,5288.200," I would I'm gonna say it actually each thing is also everything"
5289.300,5290.900," so this little book in my"
5291.300,5291.800," house is everything"
5292.400,5293.600," not because it's a special book"
5297.000,5298.000," this cover coffee"
5298.800,5301.700," you know and actually then it's full of weird teaching stories"
5304.200,5309.100," you know what is Buddha nature is what what's this underlying level of reality that everything is"
5309.800,5310.300," answer"
5311.100,5311.300," it's"
5311.700,5312.500," this cup"
5312.700,5313.300," of coffee"
5316.200,5322.000," you know actually don't all I know is is a compostable bamboo Cup"
5324.700,5325.200," and that's it"
5326.500,5327.000," ultimately"
5328.000,5329.200," is a compostable"
5330.000,5330.700," bamboo"
5332.500,5333.000," cup and"
5333.700,5334.100," anyway so"
5335.000,5337.300," what it was this guy talking about you know anyway"
5338.100,5339.600," but somehow this is actually real"
5340.000,5340.700," so that's"
5341.200,5343.000," part of the most important thing I'm going to have to share"
5343.700,5345.000," and other part of it"
5345.900,5349.300," is that that's one track and there's a second track"
5350.000,5351.200," and the second track"
5351.800,5352.500," is very"
5353.800,5354.600," kind"
5355.900,5356.900," to us humans"
5358.300,5359.800," see there are parts that say"
5362.300,5362.700," hey"
5363.000,5364.000," it's just realised that"
5364.800,5366.900," realize that the coffee cup is the whole universe"
5367.400,5367.800," easy"
5368.200,5368.700," and then you're done"
5369.500,5370.400," you know just realise it"
5371.000,5373.600," well how the earth am I supposed to just realise that"
5375.500,5376.200," well because it's real"
5377.100,5377.900," you have a how"
5378.900,5380.000," and we'll just sit there"
5380.500,5384.100," sit there a long time we don't have it'll take you five minutes or 50 years"
5384.500,5385.100," just sit there"
5386.800,5388.900," I mean they're really are traditions that are do it like that"
5391.400,5395.600," but actually it doesn't have to be quite such as sheer Cliff"
5396.800,5398.900," kind of there is a little path we can follow"
5400.000,5402.600," and that little path is the other Wheel track"
5403.200,5404.800," where it is the part of the kindness"
5405.700,5408.000," not trying to get something that's not already here"
5408.900,5409.800," not trying to get"
5410.200,5411.200," anything actually"
5412.200,5412.400," just"
5413.300,5415.300," trying to tend kindly"
5416.000,5417.200," to what is a rising for us"
5418.400,5420.900," rather there's a negative emotion or a positive emotion"
5421.400,5422.600," or a sound in the room"
5423.900,5427.600," or you know some thought that persistent and"
5428.500,5429.900," it just let it we just let it be"
5430.900,5432.100," we don't there's no measuring up"
5432.900,5434.200," there's no high bar"
5434.300,5435.000," to get over"
5435.900,5437.200," there's nothing to accomplish"
5438.300,5439.200," there's nothing to achieve"
5441.300,5442.200," we're just learning"
5443.200,5444.400," to kind of soften"
5445.300,5445.700," into"
5446.700,5447.200," being here"
5448.200,5448.600," like this"
5453.100,5453.800," so let's let's"
5454.800,5456.900," I think we'll just let's stand up for a moment"
5458.100,5460.800," and maybe Luke you could just give us two or three minutes of"
5461.500,5462.200," easy movement"
5463.300,5464.200," easy movement"
5464.600,5464.800," great"
5465.300,5465.500," okay"
5466.100,5467.000," let's start like that"
5471.400,5473.300," take a couple of Smooth breaths"
5474.700,5476.100," there's no wrong way to do it you know"
5477.100,5478.700," that's how this this kind of movement"
5479.300,5480.500," you can move it up and down and"
5480.900,5481.800," kind of really create"
5482.300,5484.400," a little bit of Bend in the knees and just to loosen this in the body"
5485.800,5488.200," we won't go cheap on balanced like we did before but just"
5488.900,5492.400," same way you did before this recognise tension in the face breathe through your nose"
5494.200,5495.800," hold your breath for a minute doing this"
5497.300,5498.700," and then make an r sound"
5501.200,5503.400," and then try a breath in through your mouth like a straw"
5505.900,5506.500," well there"
5507.500,5509.600," make an awesome but don't use your mouth through nose"
5511.700,5513.800," good at the bottom just for three or four seconds"
5515.500,5517.300," now another test with your breath moves"
5521.900,5523.300," and make circles of your hands"
5526.100,5529.300," just gonna be mindful of your neighbor and open up like this a little bit"
5530.500,5531.200," and then go the other way"
5533.500,5535.800," and then from your arms kind of really get going like this"
5536.200,5536.500," laughing"
5537.400,5537.600," good"
5539.100,5540.900," you can put these out in front of you and see how this feels"
5543.000,5544.300," notice how this affects your breathing"
5549.300,5550.500," and just make it really easy"
5551.600,5552.500," there's down by your sides"
5553.200,5553.400," good"
5553.900,5558.500," so now just take a few breaths where you extend the length of your limbs from"
5559.100,5562.300," really your femur heads and the heads of your arms all the way to your"
5562.900,5564.300," fingertips and your toes"
5565.400,5566.300," and then soften"
5566.600,5569.800," any sense of reaching or contracting on the exhale"
5570.200,5575.400," so just kind of move breathe with that now breathe in and feel the spreading the open of your hands and your feet and lengthening of your limbs"
5576.200,5581.800," and then breathe out and let all kind of feel like it's coming back into the body so you might go a little bit wider with your feet"
5582.300,5585.500," just continue this gentle movement lengthen the bones"
5586.300,5591.000," feel a little bit of contraction from your hands and your feet up your limbs and then let us off in"
5591.500,5593.700," so you can get that correspondence going with breathing good"
5594.300,5596.800," then we'll go just kind of like out here like that like a Scarecrow"
5598.600,5599.100," yeah nice"
5599.800,5600.100," soft"
5601.000,5601.700," and then up here"
5602.500,5604.500," like a like a stretched out at x"
5605.300,5606.600," the letter x good"
5607.300,5610.300," a couple of breaths just like this feel the feet in the ground again and breathe from"
5610.900,5613.200," the four corners of your feet all the way up to the"
5613.800,5614.900," four corners of your hands"
5617.100,5622.200," and if this is too much you could always go here we're all we're going to meet here in a minute to hands in a lace on top of the head"
5622.800,5623.500," and we'll go back to"
5624.400,5628.300," what's called pathways we're really sorry we read in and out of the body knows in"
5630.600,5635.000," hold the breath and from your elbows all the way down to your heels read out of your nose"
5636.600,5638.000," yeah it feels to breathe from your heels"
5638.600,5640.600," up to your thumbs on the back of your head through your nose"
5643.000,5647.000," hold your breath briefly and keep your face soft and be that of your mouth with an r sound"
5649.600,5650.700,"and then like you're pulling through a"
5651.200,5652.900," real big straw in through your mouth"
5656.100,5656.600," hold their"
5658.000,5660.200," and read that like you're breathing out through a coffee straw"
5662.500,5664.100," that in the space of your body"
5664.800,5667.600," and then switch breathe in like you're breathing in through a coffee straw"
5672.000,5674.200," and make the hole wider and breathe out like a"
5674.700,5675.700," big gulp straw"
5679.200,5683.400," and then just an open relaxed mouth breathe in into your the space behind you"
5685.400,5686.300," and breathe out of your nose"
5687.300,5693.100," just circulate the breath a few times naturally that way don't let there be a positive bottom breathe in from your heels to your thumbs"
5694.800,5698.200," and gently breathe out from your thumbs through your nose down to your toes"
5700.100,5701.400," just take your hands up"
5704.900,5705.800," just showed us relax"
5707.000,5710.700," and then when we're about to reach up and let the breath do the stretching internally for you"
5711.600,5717.900," and the same way we did at the beginning in the first thing we did just feel the gravity in a way of your arms as your arms come down by yourself"
5721.400,5723.900," really good and just to kind of round it off"
5724.200,5727.900," take your left hand and just go right underneath your navel and your right hand on top of that"
5728.400,5730.400," you could keep your eyes open you can close your eyes"
5732.900,5736.900," to them in qigong or in martial arts it's called Dante and empowerment"
5737.700,5739.900," just see if you can feel the warmth of your hands"
5740.900,5741.700," and the weight"
5742.400,5744.400," from your below your navel all the way down to your feet"
5745.300,5746.600," let your feet spread into the ground"
5747.800,5751.300," and then see how it feels to sense that from your hands up"
5752.000,5756.300," your spine is um like a string and your head is like a helium blue"
5757.600,5758.600," balance box"
5759.400,5760.000," to breathe in"
5761.800,5762.200," and out"
5765.400,5766.800," all right I hope that feels good"
5768.100,5768.600," thanks everybody"
5775.300,5777.500," I just want to welcome everybody on online"
5778.000,5778.800," thank you for being with us"
5779.200,5779.300," and"
5780.800,5783.300," hope all well on the av front"
5783.700,5784.500," folks online"
5786.600,5788.600," okay well we're going to we're going to do another set"
5789.700,5791.200," to take us up to our break"
5792.700,5794.400," and I'll do a little bit of guidance and"
5795.700,5796.700," just helped us get in"
5797.100,5797.800," and into it"
5799.300,5799.400," and"
5801.400,5803.000," then see if we can have some quiet"
5805.700,5807.200," just sharing quiet"
5812.500,5812.900," so get"
5813.400,5814.000," get comfortable"
5817.200,5818.100," if you haven't tried"
5819.300,5820.100," sitting with your back"
5820.700,5821.000," free"
5822.700,5823.800," you could you could"
5824.200,5825.400," see if you want to try that I mean"
5826.000,5829.700," only if you want to there's there's no particular advantage to it actually"
5830.500,5832.200," if you're curious you can try it"
5836.300,5838.700," but I would say if you are sitting with back free"
5839.700,5841.300," it is really important to be relaxed"
5842.600,5844.400," and you can't really be relaxed"
5845.400,5846.200," unless you're balanced"
5847.100,5850.500," so so if you're back is free like mine is"
5852.400,5855.800," just make sure that you know your your shoulders are over your hip"
5856.300,5858.300," and you ears are over your shoulders"
5859.100,5863.100," and you've got a little bit of lumbar arts in other words that the lower spine"
5863.600,5865.400," is coming forward just a little bit"
5866.400,5866.600," that"
5866.900,5868.000," sets the whole thing up"
5869.100,5871.300," and then you can have your shoulders a little bit back"
5872.600,5873.500," and settled"
5876.400,5880.300," and if you're sitting with your back resting and supported"
5882.300,5884.000," really give it"
5884.300,5884.500," to"
5885.200,5888.200," the support am I loud enough by the way hear me"
5888.500,5888.800," okay"
5939.300,5939.700," I just"
5940.200,5943.100," check in with how how you're doing right now"
5956.100,5957.200," how are you feeling"
5959.300,5959.700," what's"
5960.100,5960.400," what's"
5960.900,5962.100," a rising for you"
5964.100,5964.600," how are you doing"
5966.900,5967.500," right now"
5984.500,5985.000," we can just"
5985.400,5986.700," check in with a few things"
5988.600,5991.000," let's see other any images in the mind"
5996.100,5998.100," as a kind of internal movie"
5998.500,5999.100," screen"
6000.400,6000.900," sometimes"
6001.800,6003.900," images are a flickering on it"
6004.800,6006.200," we're seeing scenes and"
6007.100,6007.700," images"
6008.800,6010.600," other times is it's at rest"
6010.900,6012.000," it's kind of blank"
6013.300,6014.300," it just take a look"
6027.400,6030.000," can you detect any faint subtle"
6030.700,6032.000," ghostly images"
6041.900,6042.500," or is it"
6042.600,6043.300," still and"
6044.900,6047.000," quieter at rest in the"
6052.200,6053.100," projector off"
6066.200,6068.100," and by the way there's no preference"
6071.300,6071.700," we just"
6073.500,6074.700," becoming more aware"
6077.400,6078.100," of what's going on"
6096.300,6099.500," and how is the internal radio"
6100.500,6102.200," the inner commentary"
6103.800,6104.700," can you hear"
6107.400,6108.900," commentary talk"
6110.800,6112.300," monologue dialogue"
6113.200,6113.900," in the mind"
6117.300,6117.800," or"
6118.900,6120.300," is the radio"
6120.700,6121.200," currently"
6122.300,6122.800," quiet"
6166.300,6168.500," yeah we're listening inwardly"
6170.700,6172.600," here whether we can detect"
6173.700,6175.500," internal commentary"
6177.400,6177.900," talk"
6179.000,6180.400," in the mind or if"
6182.700,6184.500," it happens to currently be"
6185.500,6186.000," silent"
6187.500,6188.300," both are"
6188.600,6189.400," welcome"
6238.600,6240.700," sometimes there is Token the mind"
6242.700,6245.000," and we just are aware of it"
6246.600,6247.900," and sometimes"
6249.400,6250.500," the mind is quiet"
6252.900,6255.500," and we listen into that quiet"
6257.700,6258.700," both are fine"
6325.000,6327.500," now let's be aware of the whole body"
6328.700,6329.500," can you"
6331.900,6333.000," sense the whole of the body"
6335.400,6341.100," however vaguely it doesn't have to be perfectly accurate or anything just a sense of the"
6342.200,6344.300," kind of the energy field of the body"
6345.900,6349.200," sometimes there may be a little bit of an image of the body in the mind"
6352.600,6355.500," sometimes you just censor kind of general warm"
6357.300,6360.100," or a bit of tingling sometimes"
6361.400,6362.900," there's no right or wrong way"
6365.900,6370.300," but we're just seeing whether attention can stay with"
6372.200,6377.500," some kind of general body Sensation sensation of the body field"
6378.400,6379.200," as a whole"
6435.700,6438.800," now let's start to be aware of the breath"
6443.600,6446.400," let's see if we can receive the breath imagine that"
6448.600,6448.800," your you're"
6450.300,6451.900," something like a rock pool"
6453.900,6454.200," and"
6455.900,6457.000," the Waves"
6457.900,6458.600," of the ocean"
6459.700,6460.500," are coming in"
6462.000,6463.000," they're Rising"
6464.300,6465.500," and they're falling"
6471.100,6472.600," and you don't have to do a thing"
6476.800,6478.900," Rise and Fall of the breath"
6481.700,6483.000," happens by itself"
6486.500,6488.600," as the ocean swells"
6490.500,6491.500," passed through you"
6502.300,6504.400," sometimes they come quicker"
6505.800,6507.300," sometimes they come slower"
6521.700,6525.800," sometimes they're they're stronger and Fuller sometimes they're shallow"
6527.500,6528.300," slight"
6536.600,6537.500," imagine that"
6538.500,6540.600," your touching the surface of that water"
6541.700,6542.400," with a feather"
6544.800,6547.700," and just sensing it rise and fall"
6554.600,6555.900," they are attention is"
6556.900,6557.900," light as a feather"
6564.600,6565.700," following the lift"
6567.400,6568.100," and fall"
6600.000,6602.200," and just letting it be as it is"
6606.500,6608.900," there is no way it's supposed to be"
6651.000,6652.600," that really let the breath"
6654.100,6654.900," to you"
6677.900,6680.900," that is rolling ocean swells of breath"
6682.700,6683.800," calm you down"
6695.900,6700.000," if they want to come more gently and slowly let them"
6703.900,6707.100," a breath wants to be big Let It Be Big"
6860.400,6860.500,"okay"
6861.400,6862.100," so um"
6862.600,6865.200," sweat a word of thanks to Luke"
6866.000,6868.600," Luke thank you so much for your wonderful guidance"
6869.700,6870.600," to help for our bodies"
6872.600,6875.100," thanks to Sarah for helping"
6875.600,6876.600," to check us all in"
6877.800,6879.200," thanks to Jeremy for"
6880.000,6882.300," tremendous amount with setup actually Lucas well"
6883.400,6884.000," thanks to"
6885.400,6886.300," crossings healing"
6886.800,6889.000," base for allowing us to be here"
6890.800,6892.000," another and the team"
6893.800,6895.400," so we're coming to the break"
6895.800,6896.000," and"
6897.500,6898.500," I really feel"
6900.000,6902.400," disinclined to give you any kind of guidance"
6902.900,6903.800," just"
6904.700,6905.400," enjoy the break"
6905.800,6911.900," I mean if if some if you happen to be a person who happens to feel right now like they want to stay"
6912.900,6914.500," you know in a very meditative"
6915.100,6918.300," of this place you know that you can you can buy almost stay and sit here"
6919.800,6923.200," have your lunch if you're having lunch you could have your lunch"
6924.100,6926.400," so low in a mindful way where you"
6927.200,6930.000," you know the main thing there is to be aware of"
6931.400,6932.900," the process of getting"
6933.600,6935.200," food onto fork"
6936.000,6937.500," lifting fork to mouth"
6939.100,6940.300," depositing in mouth"
6940.700,6941.500," food stuffs"
6942.100,6942.700," chewing"
6943.800,6944.500," swallowing"
6945.700,6946.200," and then"
6947.400,6948.600," doing and then repeat"
6949.400,6950.000," loading up"
6950.400,6951.000," lifting"
6951.700,6952.500," inserting"
6953.000,6953.500," chewing"
6954.100,6954.600," swallowing"
6955.100,6955.500," repeat"
6956.000,6960.100," that's how you can eat mindfully you know tick that han against says two"
6960.600,6961.600," x number of times"
6962.300,6963.000," every mouthful"
6963.800,6965.600," I've found that it really depends what you're eating"
6966.000,6968.400," how many times"
6969.900,6973.000," but there's a there's a yogic idea that the mouth is a"
6973.400,6975.100," is a kind of pre stomach"
6976.000,6976.500," that you're doing"
6977.300,6979.200," instead of preparing the food for the"
6980.100,6980.500," the journey"
6981.000,6982.900," to come through the digestive tract"
6983.300,6985.300," and then the more you choose the easier it is"
6986.000,6989.000," and the better your digestion will be in fact there's a health clinic"
6989.700,6992.100," I've never been to it but I've read about it in Austria"
6993.000,6993.100," that"
6994.200,6994.900," their main"
6995.800,6997.000," their main thing"
6997.300,6998.000," to help people"
6998.900,6999.700," calm down"
7000.500,7001.600," is chewing"
7002.800,7005.500," when you go there you are supposed to chew"
7006.500,7009.600," to the point that you hardly need to swallow because everything is being sort of"
7010.100,7010.600," pulped"
7010.800,7010.900," and"
7012.000,7014.000," you know master to such a point"
7014.500,7019.000," that it can actually enter the the digestive tract almost without swallowing"
7019.400,7021.800," and that's how they calm people down"
7022.700,7027.200," you know there's they you know that's what they do that's if you go there and it's going to be healthy food"
7027.800,7029.500," but mostly you're going to chew it"
7029.900,7032.500," and your digestive system will be much happier"
7033.800,7035.200," and you'll be much happier"
7035.700,7036.400," that's what they say"
7337.900,7339.900," welcome back from lunch everybody"
7343.700,7346.300," Henry will be back in here with us momentarily and I've been"
7347.000,7349.200," instructed to begin with a little bit of"
7350.300,7350.900," more active"
7351.600,7352.400," and body practice"
7352.900,7356.600," so if you're good with this what I'd like to start with is a little bit of"
7357.200,7357.500," this"
7358.200,7360.400," thing I'd touched on before pathway breathing"
7362.000,7362.200," just"
7362.500,7363.200," two or three minutes of"
7364.300,7365.500," moove connected breathing"
7367.300,7370.900," and then we'll stand and we'll just kind of shake it out a little bit it's the son right"
7371.700,7374.300," cool so let's start with hands Like This"
7375.200,7377.700," just get a little bit of that a little bit of heat in your hands"
7380.600,7382.600,"really good take a breath in through your nose you're doing this"
7384.400,7387.100," and then put these hands on your belly and hold your breath at the top"
7387.600,7389.000," and you can close your eyes if you'd like"
7391.300,7392.700," and then through your mouth you can breathe out"
7394.900,7396.400," so we'll breathe from where your hands are"
7396.900,7399.000," To Your Heart first and about half a breath"
7400.600,7401.600," take a little pause right there"
7402.300,7404.500," and then from your heart breathe up to where your throat is"
7406.100,7413.500," and hold for about ten seconds as long as it's comfortable for you just see if you can sink into this cloud-like hold of the space of the einhell"
7415.100,7418.200," and then the same thing through your mouth with a sized sound breed out"
7420.200,7425.400," see how it feels now from the base of your spine and your chair to breathe all the way up through your collar bones"
7425.900,7427.900," into that helium balloon of your head"
7430.800,7433.300," and let the breathe beheld openly"
7433.800,7434.200," in you"
7434.900,7435.500," in relaxed"
7437.100,7438.300," just look for five more seconds"
7440.600,7441.600," and then breathe out of your mouth"
7443.900,7444.200," and so"
7445.300,7447.400," collaborate with the movement of your breath let the"
7447.600,7449.900," pattern of natural breathing be observed"
7450.900,7452.400," um but have your"
7453.100,7454.500," own sense of touch on it"
7455.000,7455.000," so"
7455.600,7455.800," you"
7456.500,7459.100," are breathing and the breath is breathing you the same time"
7461.100,7462.000," in the space of your body"
7463.600,7465.100," and then just begin to follow me with this"
7465.800,7467.900," gentle looping pattern reading through your nose"
7469.900,7470.800," and out through your nose"
7472.000,7474.200," just do three more breaths like that nose in"
7475.500,7478.100," see how it feels to round the corner into the Excel"
7479.000,7479.700," round the corner"
7480.300,7481.800," into the einhell gently"
7485.400,7486.900," and one more breath from your nose"
7487.600,7487.800," up"
7489.500,7490.900," and through your nose down"
7492.500,7494.400," and keep the breath moving breathe in through your nose"
7496.700,7498.400," and breathe out through your mouth little quieter"
7500.600,7501.400," and pick it back up"
7503.300,7506.000," and just kind of get out of the way of the letting go of the exhale"
7508.500,7509.500," two more nose in"
7511.800,7512.500," mouth out"
7513.400,7517.400," and you can look at this as like the third or fourth Gear if you were driving into the nose"
7518.900,7519.700," and out to the mouth"
7521.500,7524.200," and take a rich full breath through your mouth now and anyway you'd like"
7526.500,7528.000," and the same way out through your mouth"
7529.700,7532.300," and play with the shape of your lips now anyway you'd like"
7534.700,7536.100," and the same way moving out"
7538.800,7540.500," and make it even softer this time"
7543.000,7545.500," and notice that that corresponds with it being quieter"
7547.500,7549.400," and try one more and relax your face"
7554.700,7558.400," and then the last pathway of breathing and I'm going down shifting reading through your mouth"
7559.400,7561.100," just open relax mouth between the"
7561.500,7562.400," palette & pelvic floor"
7563.000,7563.900," and then breathe out of the nose"
7566.300,7569.600," let the pattern naturally slow down to take more of a natural breathe"
7570.000,7570.300," of the mouth"
7571.800,7576.400," and see how it feels to allow the exhale to be more organic and"
7577.900,7578.900," non effort"
7580.000,7581.200," try that one more time nothing"
7583.900,7584.500," and those out"
7586.500,7587.300," and then go ahead and just"
7587.900,7589.100," simply place your hands here"
7589.700,7590.700," just below your collarbones"
7592.200,7596.400," see how it feels to breathe into the chair that's holding you at your glutes"
7597.100,7598.900," and I probably your mid back"
7601.100,7602.500," with this feedback loop in the front"
7606.800,7610.000," and you might notice that it's a little bit easier to have an engaged but"
7611.300,7613.600," an active but effortless breath pattern"
7617.000,7619.400," and as long as you're given it but you stand up"
7625.100,7629.600," so be a little bit more gentle we'll do this in like two two or three intervals"
7630.100,7633.400," hands on your hips look down at your feet shoes on or off totally up to you"
7633.900,7636.300," and just kind of sway side to side like your"
7636.700,7639.800," a cat needing a pillow and in essentially see how it feels to"
7640.500,7642.500," press into the four corners of both feet"
7643.100,7645.000," and just note if the way it goes into the"
7646.000,7649.500," ball mounts behind your toes or more into your heels and just explore"
7650.500,7652.200," and bring your attention back to your breathing"
7654.100,7654.300," just"
7654.800,7655.800," kind of like Sway"
7656.300,7657.300," and win so to speak"
7658.800,7662.300," and then we'll do this we'll get a little bit more movement going with the hands like we did before"
7667.500,7669.400," good and we'll do this gentle bouncing"
7670.100,7674.200," so now that we've kind of put some of these pieces together to what happens if you let go of the actual"
7674.600,7675.300," flicking"
7676.100,7679.600," to the hands and just see if the movement the bouncing through your knees allows for"
7680.500,7682.000," hands and arms like ropes"
7684.700,7688.700," and a smooth breath pattern will just do five breaths together any of the pathways that felt most"
7689.400,7692.100," accessible for you to read fully and gently"
7692.600,7693.500," and easily in your body"
7697.400,7699.300," of course you could explore with with all of them"
7709.700,7711.500," close your eyes and just see how it feels"
7712.100,7714.100," for the next two breaths to stay steady"
7724.000,7726.200," and the eyes can open you can put your hands back on your hips"
7726.900,7729.500," and we're going to do like um slow motion kind of hula hooping"
7731.000,7733.900," um maybe like five or six circles clockwise"
7736.300,7737.800," and again just see if you can feel the weight"
7740.100,7741.100," distribution from"
7742.000,7743.800," heals the toe mounts to heal"
7744.400,7744.700," etc"
7745.600,7747.100," as you can stand up real tall through your head"
7747.700,7750.400," like you're drawing a circle on the ceiling through the crown of your head"
7751.000,7753.400," and then in midstream switch until the other direction"
7753.900,7756.600," you might need to bend your knees a little bit that way am I make it a little easier"
7757.500,7760.400," just note that you're playing with weight and bring attention back to your breath"
7761.600,7763.100," let your arms come down by your sides"
7763.800,7766.100," and just see how it feels to do this it's going to reach Up"
7766.700,7770.300," spread open through your fingers like really actively spread the webbing of your fingers"
7770.900,7774.500," do this little thing we did it earlier and now just kind of like you're walking in place it's been your knees"
7775.400,7776.800," bring the attention back to your breath"
7777.100,7779.800," good you can turn your palms out to the sides thumbs forward"
7780.300,7782.800," it could dip deep breathe in here and you can stop the swing"
7784.500,7786.600," just be mindful of your neighbor's and come out to the sides"
7787.800,7789.100," go ahead and bring the hands behind you"
7789.500,7793.400," to the best of your ability and squeeze your elbows back some and the chest up"
7794.800,7797.000," good and you can just kind of sit down just a little bit"
7797.800,7799.100," bring the hands out and in front of you"
7799.900,7803.900," and take the hands forward like you're pulling them apart and drop your ears down and take a breath here"
7806.600,7807.900," and then stand back up"
7809.300,7813.100," just find these placements but just touch this time and a breath here"
7813.600,7814.600," under your colour bones"
7817.300,7817.500," good"
7817.800,7819.300," here under your armpits"
7821.700,7827.200," you might feel heat from this kind of motion thumbs can go to the eyes of your elbows for breath"
7831.600,7832.600," and it can go to your groins"
7833.300,7834.700," you can kind of lean forward like this"
7835.600,7838.000," and you can also sit back like this and kind of wag a little bit"
7839.100,7843.300," and then as you're seated kind of like this in the bent knees go to the backs of the knees"
7844.600,7845.100," find your breath"
7846.000,7849.300," straighten your legs out just a little bit and kind of zwei again to see how this feels for the legs"
7850.400,7852.600," and then go down on the outside of your shins"
7853.400,7854.400," really outside of your feet"
7855.100,7857.300," come up the inside of your shins"
7857.700,7858.300," muscles"
7859.100,7860.700," thighs until you go across your"
7861.000,7861.700," project sets"
7862.400,7864.900," up your hips and your kidneys and we'll just do this little"
7865.600,7867.700," kneading at the kidneys little padding"
7869.000,7869.500," so Softly"
7873.400,7875.000," great and then Arms by your sides"
7875.700,7876.400," simple just stand"
7877.400,7879.400," with the weight from the naval down into the feet"
7880.800,7881.800," you can deep breath in together"
7884.000,7885.000," hold the breath of the top"
7886.900,7888.200," and then how to pop the bub"
7892.200,7893.100," write welcome back everybody"
7896.500,7897.000," okay"
7897.800,7898.000," um"
7899.400,7900.700," yeah thanks Luke that was lovely"
7902.300,7903.200," I hope you all had a good"
7904.400,7905.000," break"
7905.400,7907.000," whatever you however you spent it"
7908.000,7910.700," and good to be back our journey goes on"
7911.100,7912.800," and I want to just tell you a little bit about"
7913.600,7914.700," where the journey goes"
7915.500,7919.000," the this my latest book originally love is a"
7920.400,7920.900," I kind of"
7921.300,7922.400," say it's free things"
7923.300,7927.400," it's a manifesto and it's a map and it's a manual"
7927.800,7928.900," and the manifesto part"
7929.900,7931.200," I think I spoke to a bit this morning"
7931.600,7933.000," the manifesto is essentially"
7934.100,7935.100," there is this reality"
7936.400,7943.900," and then they say there is the reality even prior to heaven and earth it indeed it has no named much lesser form"
7944.500,7946.900," ice can't see it ears can't detect it"
7947.500,7948.200," it has no voice"
7948.600,7949.400," for years to detect"
7949.900,7951.800," to call it mine to call it"
7952.600,7955.000," dharma to call it but a violates it's nature"
7956.100,7956.900," it's got no name"
7957.400,7959.000," but it's real and we can find it"
7959.500,7960.200," so that's sort of"
7960.700,7964.100," manifesto one and manifesto two is actually"
7965.200,7966.300," yeah all the above"
7966.800,7969.000," but also there's an easy way"
7969.600,7970.700," to help us ourselves"
7971.100,7973.400," gradually get more aligned with it"
7973.900,7977.700," even if we haven't clearly really Limited"
7978.700,7980.200," okay but it's true but"
7980.900,7981.400," don't worry"
7982.100,7983.600," and think oh my gosh what am I missing"
7984.100,7984.900," you're not missing anything"
7985.600,7989.300," and there's this beautiful part of gradual development and those of"
7989.900,7990.200," I mean I"
7991.300,7992.100," this is important to me"
7992.700,7995.400," because it's real but it's also because I actually had a"
7995.900,7998.100," flash of this thing this Awakening thing"
7998.500,7999.200," when I was 19"
8000.100,8003.300," out of the blue with absolutely no practice"
8004.300,8008.300," or no interest in chronic spirituality over word really didn't mean anything to me"
8008.900,8010.800," but I suddenly just dropped into it"
8011.500,8011.700," and"
8013.100,8015.600," and I thought my life had been completed"
8016.200,8019.400," I felt it was so good that I felt I don't need to live anymore"
8020.300,8020.700," my life is"
8021.300,8022.200," totally fulfilled"
8022.900,8026.000," just by virtue of finding this reality I really felt that very strongly"
8026.900,8028.700," even though I was butter with a snapper"
8029.300,8030.900," and um"
8032.200,8033.000," six weeks later"
8033.800,8036.700," I was aware at the time of far from home 6 week later"
8037.700,8040.400," I was back home in Oxford in England where I grew up"
8041.100,8043.000," in a very unhappy dysfunctional"
8044.100,8045.100," pair of households"
8045.700,8045.900," and"
8047.700,8050.700," with a grown up with a terrible really severe"
8051.200,8054.300," skin condition often in hospital and things through my childhood"
8055.300,8057.800," and I came back and basically that"
8058.600,8059.900," beautiful Discovery"
8060.900,8061.200," that"
8061.600,8063.800," that her transformed my way of"
8064.500,8067.400," feeling what life was moment to moment"
8068.300,8071.200," and I was living in a sort of different experience of the world"
8072.000,8073.500," there are after that had happened"
8074.000,8076.900," but the moment I got home I mean literally within half an hour"
8077.500,8079.100," of walking through my dad's front door"
8081.000,8082.200," it was as if it was just"
8084.000,8084.700," corner away from"
8085.100,8085.900," me and I was back"
8086.300,8087.100," to square one"
8087.900,8090.400," only now I knew how bad it was"
8091.000,8091.100," because"
8091.900,8096.500," through my childhood at adapted I'd evolved adaptive parts that helped me cope"
8096.900,8098.200," and I really didn't feel"
8099.100,8102.400," how how unhappy I actually was you know"
8103.100,8106.500," because I wanted to get through school I wanted to have friendships and I wanted to"
8107.800,8112.000," do what I could to get by you know and I think we all do this we adapt and"
8112.600,8114.400," but when this experience happened"
8115.000,8118.600," I kind of lost all my adaptations and I was truly open"
8119.200,8121.100," and actually experiencing the world as it was and"
8121.500,8123.000," and it was overwhelmingly beautiful"
8123.200,8125.200," you know and I felt full of love and"
8126.600,8131.300," I felt like I belonged in the marrow of my bones"
8132.100,8132.200," you know"
8132.700,8134.400," so then six weeks later when I went home and"
8135.400,8137.000," sort of Lost That"
8138.000,8139.200," it was very"
8140.100,8142.300," it was very hard I was really traumatised"
8142.500,8144.500," basically in some language in a"
8146.200,8147.100," and and so"
8147.900,8148.200," and then"
8148.700,8151.900," you know I limped through College very unhappily and I sort of"
8152.300,8156.800," limped into a job and I limpt into a postgraduate degree which I"
8157.700,8160.100," quickly didn't pursue actually and I and I"
8160.800,8165.600," and anyway so the life gradually picked up again but along the way I picked up meditation"
8166.200,8170.200," as a absolutely rigorous daily habit because I was taught in the"
8170.800,8172.100," the only method that was really"
8172.900,8177.100," known in London at that time was TM trying to dental meditation I assumed"
8177.700,8180.600," some of you will know will know about that it was popularised"
8181.200,8181.800," by The Beatles"
8182.200,8183.000," the one thing you know"
8183.600,8185.900," and and many others Deepak Chopra"
8186.100,8186.300," you know"
8187.000,8189.200," was an early advocate"
8190.800,8192.600," and it really helped me"
8193.300,8194.200," and and so"
8195.600,8199.700," and I started doing some therapy and I you know a lot of stuff for the evolved at help me"
8200.800,8201.100," heal"
8201.800,8202.600," but what that"
8205.200,8207.100," what those experiences taught me"
8208.000,8209.700," was exactly what I'm trying to share"
8210.300,8214.100," that is a reality called Awakening where we Awakened to"
8214.700,8215.500," a really different"
8216.500,8219.000," way of being in this world where we're not separate"
8219.200,8224.700," essentially we're and we're it's it may not sound like much the words are a bit dry not separate"
8225.200,8226.400," but it's vast"
8226.700,8229.700," in its implications it means that the normal sense of self"
8230.400,8230.900," I have"
8231.300,8232.200," of being me"
8233.600,8234.300," navigating"
8235.200,8236.500," a world that's not me"
8237.800,8240.400," in which is absolutely standard model"
8240.900,8241.800," for all of us I think"
8242.900,8247.400," unless unless again you're one of the hidden adapts of which I'm sure there are a few in the room"
8247.900,8249.800," but basically that's the way we see it"
8250.100,8252.300," and to have that go"
8252.800,8254.400," is kind of huge"
8254.800,8256.100," because the implications"
8257.100,8262.300," I said all across the board because basically everything I've been doing and thinking I should do is all"
8262.700,8265.200," predicated on me being separate"
8265.700,8266.200," you know so"
8268.900,8269.500," that's real"
8270.800,8271.000," but"
8271.400,8271.800," also"
8273.400,8274.200," there's a path"
8274.800,8275.800," of essentially"
8276.500,8277.100," in one word"
8277.700,8278.100," healing"
8279.400,8279.700," that we"
8280.300,8280.700," I believe"
8282.000,8283.000," nearly all of us anyway"
8283.500,8284.400," also need"
8285.500,8286.800," so there's a there's a kind of"
8287.500,8290.800," these two parts I talked about earlier in the car track model"
8291.200,8292.100," left wheel right wheel"
8292.900,8294.400," or maybe it's right wheel left wheel I don't know"
8294.700,8295.800," but the two- tracks"
8297.600,8299.500," you could also call them Awakening"
8300.800,8301.200," healing"
8303.200,8303.800," the reason"
8305.100,8308.100," in a sense those must be kind of separated"
8309.000,8310.000," so what of is that"
8310.800,8311.600," Awakening"
8314.000,8316.100," I mean however radical and weird and"
8316.900,8321.700," this may sound and you might you might not want to hear it in some way but Awakening needs no healing"
8322.800,8324.400," all is healed"
8324.700,8326.600," in Awakening all is"
8327.200,8327.800," healed"
8328.500,8330.500," and yet there's the other path where"
8331.200,8331.600," healing"
8332.200,8333.900," is so very necessary"
8334.600,8335.400," for individually"
8336.100,8336.900," collectively-"
8337.300,8337.800," socially"
8338.300,8339.000," societally"
8339.600,8340.100," globally"
8340.600,8341.500," it's so needed"
8342.100,8343.600," and both are somehow"
8344.000,8344.400," true"
8344.900,8346.500," it's not an either or"
8347.300,8349.100," and this is also hard for our brains"
8350.100,8351.700," because we're not used to thinking like that"
8352.400,8354.500," this way or is it that way in it can't be both"
8355.500,8355.600," that's"
8356.300,8358.300," fundamental Western logic"
8358.700,8359.600," is either a"
8360.100,8361.300," or it's not a"
8362.300,8364.100," but actually Eastern logic"
8364.400,8364.800," in its"
8366.200,8367.300," ampler wisdom"
8368.000,8368.800," says wrong"
8371.000,8371.300," actually"
8372.300,8374.200," I know they they lay this out"
8374.800,8375.100," there's"
8375.700,8376.100," yes"
8377.000,8377.400," and there's"
8378.200,8378.700," no"
8379.800,8380.300," and there's"
8380.800,8382.200," both yes and no"
8383.000,8383.500," and there's"
8383.900,8385.900," neither yes nor no"
8386.800,8388.100," for possibilities"
8389.000,8389.600," that's what they say"
8390.400,8392.600," it's in the Vader's it's in mahayana Buddhism"
8393.900,8395.500," it's actually in Parow"
8396.500,8398.300," an early Greek philosopher"
8398.800,8399.500," or century"
8400.600,8401.800," who went to India"
8402.600,8403.600," with Alexander the Great"
8405.100,8406.400," god as far as the indus river"
8407.200,8408.500," and spent eight years"
8410.200,8413.400," pierrot this Greek guy spent eight years mingling with"
8414.100,8415.100," the naked philosophers"
8416.100,8417.000," the gymnosophist"
8417.700,8418.300," and other words"
8419.500,8419.700," you know"
8420.300,8421.200," shaggy had"
8421.600,8422.600," dudes and loin cloths"
8424.700,8426.100," swam is and richest and"
8427.900,8429.200," what's the most Sonia in and"
8429.700,8429.800," you know"
8432.000,8432.900," sage's of India"
8434.100,8435.800," and he some have picked that"
8436.700,8437.500," that up there"
8438.000,8438.700," yes no"
8439.300,8440.400," both yes and no"
8441.100,8442.400," neither yes nor no"
8444.500,8445.500," to both are true"
8446.300,8446.900," both are real"
8447.400,8448.700," they don't contradict each other"
8449.200,8449.900," how can that be"
8450.900,8451.600," well the answer is"
8452.400,8453.700," the only way it can be"
8454.100,8454.600," is when"
8455.600,8456.400," our view"
8457.500,8458.000," Pops"
8459.600,8460.000," from being"
8460.700,8461.400," a to b"
8462.100,8464.500," to including a and b"
8466.600,8468.100," like I'm here and I want to get there"
8468.800,8470.600," what if I'm already in both places"
8471.000,8473.700," what if there's a reality that is much more inclusive"
8474.300,8475.200," that I'm part of"
8475.700,8477.400," so that's that's The Awakening side"
8478.300,8479.300," and yet at the same time"
8480.200,8481.400," I'm an ailing"
8481.800,8482.400," suffering"
8482.900,8483.600," troubled"
8484.300,8487.300," oftentimes foolish reckless selfish"
8488.200,8489.700," I'll advised human being"
8489.900,8491.300," and I go work to do"
8491.700,8493.800," I'm a I'm a wip you know"
8494.300,8495.200," a working progress"
8495.900,8498.000," so that's the other part and both are true"
8499.100,8501.000," so now it's absolutely perfect and I think a bit hot"
8501.800,8502.500," is it going to"
8503.000,8504.600," if that's not is that on"
8506.000,8507.400," and it doesn't look like it's on"
8510.300,8511.000," it's not on yeah"
8514.500,8519.400," you got it very good"
8520.300,8521.700," both hot and not hot yeah"
8522.600,8522.900," thank you"
8526.700,8528.000," it's awfully hot and not hot"
8529.900,8535.500," okay so that's so that's our that's basically sort of manifesto now the map"
8535.800,8538.000," to we're already got a bit of it two"
8538.700,8539.500," two two run"
8539.900,8541.000," of one path"
8541.300,8541.800," we could call"
8543.000,8544.700," it all we can say two parts it doesn't really matter"
8546.600,8547.600," but the rut"
8548.600,8551.000," or the sorry the wheel right or the Wheel track"
8551.800,8556.400," that is the mindfulness gradual progressive developmental"
8556.800,8557.200," one"
8558.100,8558.900," that one"
8559.700,8559.800," in"
8560.600,8561.700," my book original love"
8562.400,8563.400," I break it down"
8563.900,8564.500," into three"
8565.500,8565.700," three"
8566.600,8570.900," areas of growth I call them ins because they're sort of refugees"
8571.600,8573.900," for the troubled human out on the high seas of"
8574.900,8575.700," of pain and"
8576.200,8576.500," suffering"
8578.000,8579.400," there's 3 refuges"
8581.000,8582.600," and I'm missing my metaphors"
8583.100,8584.800," I should say three harbors"
8585.200,8586.000," if I was going that way"
8586.700,8590.100," out in the gorgeous and ravines and the deserts there are three"
8590.700,8591.500," in"
8593.000,8593.800," the path of"
8594.900,8595.200," healing"
8595.800,8598.400," number one is mindfulness that we've already started to look at"
8599.400,8601.900," and that's basically becoming more aware"
8602.600,8603.400," of what's going on"
8604.200,8604.500," right now"
8605.500,8606.900," and to make it even easier"
8607.700,8609.300," when we're being still in quiet"
8610.000,8612.700," basically we got a certain amount of external"
8613.200,8616.000," world facing experience going on we're hearing stuff"
8616.500,8617.300," we're seeing stuff"
8618.000,8619.800," and we're sensing body"
8620.400,8620.700," which is"
8621.200,8622.200," touch pressure"
8622.800,8623.300," warmth"
8623.700,8624.200," coolness"
8625.100,8627.000," motion you can feel when you're on your arms move"
8627.600,8629.000," you know in the contact of eir"
8629.300,8630.600," with skin and so on"
8633.100,8636.300," those three things a basically of course they're smelling taste"
8636.600,8636.800," as well"
8637.400,8638.000," but that kind of"
8638.700,8639.400," not all the time"
8640.400,8641.300," you know whereas"
8642.100,8642.800," seeing here and"
8643.400,8644.300," tensing feeding the body"
8644.800,8645.500," they're always having"
8647.900,8648.200," that"
8648.600,8648.800," is"
8650.000,8650.600," all most"
8651.000,8652.500," the whole map of mindfulness"
8653.700,8657.900," the only reason that it isn't the whole map of mindfulness is that we have we have stuff going on in here"
8658.600,8659.000," as well"
8659.900,8661.200," and we in other words think"
8663.100,8667.200," an associated with thinking often there's emotion not always but often the most"
8668.800,8669.700," and thinking"
8672.700,8673.900," breaks down"
8674.200,8674.600," actually"
8675.300,8676.800," basically it's hearing"
8677.800,8678.400," internally"
8679.300,8680.300," and it's seeing"
8681.200,8681.800," internally"
8682.500,8684.200," that's basically what thinking is"
8684.700,8687.100," and you have to check this out for yourself and see if it"
8687.600,8692.200," this is not like the law this is like see if you can find this a helpful scheme"
8692.700,8693.000," basically"
8693.900,8694.000," so"
8695.600,8700.900," here is internally means hearing talk in the mind we were checking that out this morning commentary"
8702.100,8705.000," sometimes it's imaginary sometimes it's actually on this moment"
8706.000,8707.300," what's this guy talking about you know"
8708.000,8709.100," little voice in the mind"
8709.500,8711.200," and it's seeing images in the mind"
8712.000,8718.200," and then in terms of emotion it's some sensation in the in the heart of Chester area"
8718.900,8719.700," could be positive"
8720.800,8723.500," fizzing bubbling effervescent expansive spacious"
8724.300,8725.700," and very calm and open"
8726.300,8728.300," or it could be more contracted and"
8729.000,8730.600," tighter heavier denser"
8733.300,8736.500," agitated you know lots of different flavours of it"
8737.100,8737.900," and in mindfulness"
8739.100,8741.100," we we just want to be"
8741.600,8742.100," aware of it"
8743.000,8744.100," and if and"
8745.100,8746.800," we don't want it we don't want to change anything"
8747.100,8748.700," actually you don't need to change anything"
8749.500,8750.500," Changes by itself"
8751.000,8751.200," if we"
8751.800,8752.300," are aware of"
8752.700,8754.200," it so there's negative emotion"
8755.000,8758.100," and when not trying to push it away we're just aware of it"
8759.700,8760.900," it gradually"
8761.600,8764.200," by itself in time it's it's just softens"
8765.400,8768.700," it may not go away but it's softens and we don't mind it"
8769.200,8769.900," we're learning"
8770.700,8771.500," not to mind it"
8772.600,8773.800," and and that actually"
8774.500,8776.900," helps it and it helps us because we're learning"
8778.000,8780.000," basically in a way to love ourselves more"
8782.400,8786.300," so that's a little that's in number one we've already started exploring that in number two"
8788.000,8788.500," on this"
8791.900,8794.700," wheel right wheel rough number one"
8795.200,8795.400," is"
8796.100,8796.700," connection"
8797.600,8799.600," because there's a real tendency to think"
8800.400,8802.700," I I just do my meditation"
8803.500,8804.600," it's me and meditation"
8805.400,8808.000," I just you know there's that we've got all these ideals or the"
8808.600,8810.800," you know the adapt on the hilltop on the mountain top"
8811.500,8812.600," the Hermit in the cave"
8813.400,8814.300," is a solo thing"
8815.200,8816.600," I'll get better and better and better at it"
8817.400,8817.600," you know"
8818.600,8821.000," maybe more and more cosmic in my meditation"
8821.500,8822.600," but I'm on my own doing"
8823.300,8825.000," it and that's that's that's that's wrong"
8825.900,8826.100," actually"
8826.300,8827.000," you know we are"
8829.100,8830.600," thoroughly thoroughly connected"
8831.400,8832.400," with thoroughly"
8834.900,8837.700," as tick now has as we enter our"
8838.600,8840.300," e into hyphen r"
8841.200,8842.000," in to being"
8842.500,8843.900," everything is into being"
8844.400,8845.200," that's taking a hot"
8845.700,8847.300," nothing exists independently"
8851.100,8852.200," so we can discover that"
8852.600,8853.300," through medit"
8854.000,8854.400," second"
8854.800,8855.000," in"
8855.600,8856.800," so we becoming less separate"
8857.600,8860.300," more aware of our connectedness more aware of our dependencies"
8862.200,8866.200," and then the third Inn is about getting into absorption States where we get absorbed"
8867.000,8869.000," in present moment experience without"
8869.900,8871.900," a sense of time without a sense of"
8872.800,8875.400," effort without you know as athletes getting in the zone"
8876.300,8877.600," you know time gets weird"
8878.400,8882.000," suddenly it was all slow motion and this ball just went in the hoop and you know"
8882.700,8884.700," that what happened there you know that's flow"
8885.200,8885.600," you know that's"
8886.100,8887.800," sometimes called flow or the Zone"
8888.500,8891.700," same thing in meditation the world they call it absorbed and meditation"
8892.200,8892.900," but it's the same"
8893.200,8894.100," human phenomen"
8894.900,8895.400," and of course"
8895.700,8898.800," all of that is great all three of those ins are great"
8899.500,8901.700," so those are the ones that we can kind of work on"
8902.600,8905.400," the fourth one is The Awakening one the other track and"
8906.800,8907.100," ah"
8908.000,8910.600," it's not so clear if we can really work on it"
8911.600,8912.400," because it already"
8913.100,8914.400," is a and b"
8914.900,8917.900," so you have any work on getting to be if you already are b"
8919.100,8921.900," if you are both a and b how do you get to B you don't need to get to it"
8922.900,8923.300," see what I mean"
8925.100,8930.300," kinda okay anyway we don't need to worry about that now I've already talked about that enough for now"
8931.100,8932.900," so that's our basic map"
8933.700,8935.400," and we're just going to sort of Explorer a bit"
8936.100,8936.900," well I'll"
8937.900,8943.900," read a little bit some bobs now and then and we'll do meditations and we'll we'll have Q&A and we'll have discussions and stuff"
8944.400,8946.600," what I want to actually do right now is read a poem to you"
8947.300,8947.800," and then we'll sit"
8948.700,8953.500," so this this is a poem that is a nod really I think to mindfulness especially but a little bit"
8954.400,8957.400," zone two the connection and support zone as well"
8958.000,8959.400," and it's called sweeping the yard"
8960.300,8962.400," when I sweep the yard in the morning"
8964.000,8967.500," I don't do it for myself because I like it tidd"
8968.300,8971.300," I don't even do it for the yards"
8971.600,8974.100," sake because it enjoys being clean"
8975.000,8975.800," I do it"
8976.600,8977.700," for the shy one"
8978.300,8978.900," who lives"
8979.500,8981.600," inside me I do it for the shy"
8982.500,8983.900," one who lives inside me"
8985.600,8985.800," whose"
8987.000,8989.400," who loves this world better than I ever will"
8989.900,8992.200," whose Innocence is beyond understanding"
8993.300,8994.100," who has nothing"
8995.000,8995.500," to probe"
8996.400,8998.900," whose sweetness shines on the Earth"
8999.700,9003.000," who sweetness shines on the earth so the Earth"
9003.500,9004.400," loves itself"
9005.200,9005.600," again"
9007.200,9010.400," and who I only ever know in glimpses"
9011.500,9013.900," that leave me breathless with hope"
9014.300,9015.200," with longing"
9015.700,9019.800," the Goodness is still possible-- is still how is still somehow"
9020.300,9020.800," present"
9021.300,9022.000," in this world"
9025.000,9026.900," and who knocks away"
9027.400,9028.500," all my ideas"
9029.200,9029.700," about who"
9030.300,9030.800," and what"
9031.200,9031.900," I should be"
9033.800,9034.300," So"
9035.100,9037.300," we pick up the Broom again"
9037.600,9038.200," he and"
9039.400,9041.500," I and send the old leaves"
9042.000,9044.100," skittering across the yard"
9044.700,9045.300," and the dust"
9045.900,9047.700," smoking over the tiles"
9048.400,9049.600," like ink from a brush"
9050.900,9052.800," and we make the little heaps"
9053.800,9055.100," we'll gather in later"
9056.100,9056.300," this"
9057.100,9057.600," is how"
9058.100,9058.700," he wakes up"
9060.100,9061.100," this is how"
9061.700,9062.800," his wakefulness"
9064.100,9066.000," turns our little yard"
9066.700,9068.200," into the bright place"
9069.100,9070.100," I can call"
9070.500,9070.800," home"
9080.700,9081.200," yeah so"
9082.300,9082.800," somehow"
9083.500,9085.100," that mindful one"
9086.300,9086.600," actually"
9087.900,9088.600," is already"
9089.300,9089.500," here"
9090.700,9091.900," I just get"
9092.300,9092.600," busy"
9093.300,9093.900," and forget"
9096.800,9097.900," but if I bring my"
9099.000,9100.200," whole hearted attention"
9101.200,9103.000," to the most ordinary everyday"
9103.600,9103.800," action"
9105.100,9106.900," doesn't have to be sweeping the yard"
9107.500,9108.400," washing dishes"
9109.200,9109.500," putting"
9110.100,9110.600," my feet"
9111.000,9113.100," on the pavement as I walk down the street"
9115.300,9116.000," kicker wake up"
9117.000,9118.000," the one who loves the world"
9119.600,9119.700," yeah"
9121.200,9121.900," okay so let's"
9123.600,9124.500," let's assume the position"
9127.500,9128.800," whatever that is for you right now"
9142.200,9144.200," we'll get to that"
9144.500,9145.200," later"
9203.600,9204.400," that can we"
9205.000,9206.600," let the shoulders settle"
9206.900,9207.500," and relax"
9218.700,9220.300," can we release the jaw"
9221.100,9221.700," and the throat"
9233.800,9239.400," so so really there's this cluster there's the throat there's the jaw there's a shoulders"
9241.000,9242.500," as the back of the neck"
9245.900,9248.900," see if you can just release the entire area"
9251.700,9254.200," and make any adjustments in the body need to"
9255.400,9256.400," to allow that"
9257.800,9259.000," whole area to release"
9266.600,9271.300," and that's let's add in The Arms let them be completely slack like old ropes"
9285.000,9287.300," kind of let the whole body sag"
9288.600,9291.400," tagg downward and it's just the skeletal structure"
9292.800,9294.000," that keeps us upright"
9296.800,9298.700," but everything that isn't bone"
9300.200,9302.400," I just draping down like cloth"
9335.900,9338.600," and we can start to open up to these"
9340.100,9343.900," these territories there's the whole soundscape around us"
9351.400,9352.400," in developing us"
9398.400,9400.000," if your eyes are closed there's the"
9401.300,9404.600," there's the screen of sight behind the eyelids"
9407.000,9407.900," look into it"
9409.600,9411.500," as if it was a kind of landscape"
9415.500,9417.300," gaze into the middle distance"
9427.200,9428.300," if your eyes are open"
9429.500,9430.100," likewise"
9430.800,9432.700," kind of gaze a little beyond"
9435.100,9436.100," any objects"
9436.600,9437.700," in your field of vision"
9441.000,9444.000," in my head a bit blurry or out of focus and that's fine"
9454.200,9458.800," I sort of letting all experienced a Rise just as it does we're just letting it be"
9534.200,9535.800," sense your seat"
9547.500,9548.600," sense your feet"
9558.400,9559.500," sense your hands"
9569.200,9570.900," can you be aware of all three"
9607.900,9611.400," now can you send the gentle pulse of the breath"
9612.500,9614.300," somewhere in the middle of the"
9615.000,9615.400," body"
9659.500,9662.600," that can you imagine that you can sense the breath"
9663.800,9666.000," coming and going all through the body"
9669.100,9673.600," as if each in breathe somehow infiltrates even your hands and your feet"
9680.100,9683.200," it's kind of subtle it's like a soft breeze"
9686.000,9687.500," wafting through the body"
9688.200,9689.400," as he breathe in"
9691.900,9693.200," and as you breathe out"
9694.700,9697.800," very subtle don't strain in any way to try to find it"
9698.600,9699.800," a see if it shows up"
9705.800,9707.500," just a subtle Sensation"
9733.900,9734.500," almost"
9735.000,9739.000," something like as if the body were a Grove of bamboos and"
9740.000,9743.400," with each in breath there's a very subtle breeze"
9744.400,9745.700," through the bamboos"
9746.800,9748.500," and lightwise with the out breath"
9800.800,9802.400," every so often we"
9803.000,9804.200," we will find that we've"
9805.800,9806.800," we've got somewhere else"
9807.500,9809.500," we we haven't really been present"
9810.900,9812.300," 100% natural"
9813.700,9814.200," and when we"
9814.800,9816.600," realise we haven't been present"
9817.400,9818.400," let's just take a look"
9819.300,9821.000," check what was going on"
9821.600,9822.100," probably"
9823.300,9823.900," we were off"
9824.400,9824.600," on"
9825.900,9826.900," a train of thought"
9828.300,9829.100," so just check"
9832.300,9834.600," just check where you've been-- and"
9836.000,9839.100," can you detect that the radio was Broadcasting"
9839.500,9840.900," with words usually"
9842.200,9844.500," Cajun does it with music by the way"
9846.000,9846.300," or"
9847.800,9849.300," were there visuals"
9850.300,9851.200," video playing"
9852.700,9853.600," or was they're both"
9854.200,9856.100," audio AV in the mind"
9858.600,9859.200," talk and"
9860.300,9860.900," video"
9863.900,9865.600," the technology and welcome it"
9867.200,9869.500," and welcome the fact that you've become aware of it"
9874.200,9875.200," and then coming back"
9877.800,9881.500," to the bamboo Grove of the body with the soft breeze"
9882.900,9884.700," moving to and froze through it"
10023.700,10024.700," resting"
10027.400,10028.100," rest"
10060.000,10060.300," if if"
10061.400,10062.000," you're in"
10062.800,10068.200," that condition where it's not so easy to stay with what's going on just check your"
10069.000,10069.400," heart"
10069.900,10070.400," area"
10071.700,10074.000," see if there's anything going on there that"
10074.900,10075.900," needs a bit of love"
10077.600,10078.900," that needs to be welcomed"
10080.700,10082.000," needs to be allowed"
10087.700,10090.000," and let this mindful one"
10091.700,10092.700," aware one"
10094.300,10095.600," love and allow"
10097.400,10098.700," whatever might be going on"
10101.100,10101.600," for you"
10105.800,10107.000," they know how to do that"
10163.800,10165.000," let the quiet"
10165.300,10166.100," hold you"
10225.400,10228.600," remember we're not trying to achieve anything"
10231.500,10234.800," if you notice any trying or effort or"
10236.400,10238.600," sort of intention to achieve something"
10240.800,10242.200," can you welcome that"
10243.000,10243.800," allow"
10247.300,10248.500," that fully allow"
10250.600,10251.800," those part of you that"
10253.200,10254.300," feels it needs to"
10255.200,10256.000," achieve something"
10258.500,10260.500," like that part before fully welcomed"
10264.300,10264.800," loved"
10283.000,10284.100," that it join me"
10285.100,10286.300," so of awareness"
10311.500,10314.700," must lasts couple of minutes just let the breast"
10317.100,10318.700," take you where it wants to"
10410.900,10412.700," in keep sitting for a little bit"
10413.400,10414.000," if you'd like to"
10491.800,10492.900,"set aside"
10494.300,10499.900," sometimes it seems hard to meditate in the midst of the stream of life's activities"
10501.200,10503.900," I think of daily meditation as being like the"
10504.500,10505.300," multi-faith"
10505.700,10508.300," chapels that many airports have often"
10508.900,10511.000," when I have time I go out of my way"
10511.600,10513.400," to stop in at one of these chapels"
10514.000,10515.100," when changing planes"
10516.100,10519.400," I love exploring spaces that have been set aside"
10520.000,10521.600," from normal daily activity"
10523.300,10524.100," set aside"
10524.700,10527.400," used to be a term in British agriculture"
10528.600,10532.700," it referred to certain Fields that a farmer had quotes set aside"
10533.400,10535.100," which would not be farmed at all"
10536.200,10538.500," these fields might be plowed or Meadow"
10539.000,10540.000," but they wouldn't be touched"
10540.700,10542.300," they would be followed for years"
10543.600,10545.200," these little airport chapels"
10545.700,10547.200," are set aside"
10548.000,10552.400," as Haven's mid journey where you can interrupt the headlong rush"
10553.000,10554.300," to a new destination"
10555.200,10556.000," you can say to yourself"
10556.500,10557.000," yes"
10557.600,10558.500," I do have time"
10559.500,10562.100," yes rather than browsing for a snack"
10562.700,10564.700," I will feed myself another way"
10565.400,10567.100," I'll Give Myself The sustenance"
10567.700,10570.400," of time set aside made Rush"
10571.100,10571.700," lo and behold"
10572.400,10572.900," can"
10573.200,10573.600," do this"
10574.900,10576.600," I would find it at distinct pleasure"
10577.200,10579.900," to leave the glossy zones of the airport"
10580.400,10581.300," full of Commerce"
10581.700,10582.500," and Hast"
10583.300,10585.200," and suddenly being a place of quiet"
10586.300,10587.700," sometimes I said on a chair"
10588.300,10592.000," other times if I had my inflatable meditation cushion with me"
10592.600,10594.400," I'd pull it out of my bag blow it up"
10594.900,10596.500," and deposit myself on the floor"
10597.100,10599.300," in an out of the way spot with my shoes off"
10600.100,10600.900," and meditate"
10601.600,10602.400," and that's how"
10602.900,10603.500," meditation"
10604.300,10604.900," typically"
10605.600,10607.600," will always be for many of us"
10608.400,10610.700," right in the middle of the stream of life"
10611.600,10612.900," we extract ourselves"
10613.700,10614.800," for 20 or 30 minutes"
10615.600,10616.600," and sit quietly"
10617.600,10619.100," to one side of the Stream"
10620.200,10621.200," we allow the world"
10622.000,10623.900," to position to pursue it's rush"
10624.900,10626.600," such as the bustle of the airport"
10627.300,10628.800," just outside the chapel doors"
10629.700,10630.900," while we rest"
10631.600,10633.900," in the great lake of choir"
10634.700,10635.600," there was always here"
10636.500,10638.800," set aside just behind the world"
10639.800,10640.900," as we usually see"
10641.900,10642.600," it waiting for us"
10643.400,10644.000," to notice it"
10646.700,10650.300," so rather than seeking perfect conditions you know"
10651.500,10652.200," just that"
10653.000,10653.800," that um"
10655.100,10655.800," that act"
10656.300,10656.600," of"
10658.500,10658.900," parking"
10660.100,10661.300," ourselves on the seat"
10663.100,10663.700," I've done it"
10664.100,10665.900," in all manner of places"
10666.600,10669.300," I spent a week sitting on the streets of London once"
10670.200,10674.800," like in and you know in busy places of where the site of sidewalk was wide enough"
10675.400,10676.800," boom I just sit down"
10677.300,10678.500," on my inflatable cushion"
10679.200,10679.300," and"
10680.400,10683.300," and just sit there and I remember being outside the Bank of England"
10683.800,10685.400," you know which is the Central Bank of the UK"
10685.800,10686.900," in the center of London"
10688.500,10694.000," at Russia you know I mean I was there from two in the afternoon or something and then just sitting sitting sitting and"
10694.400,10696.700," and then hearing the build up"
10697.000,10698.300," of footballs"
10698.900,10700.000," for 35"
10700.800,10701.600," 5 30"
10702.200,10702.300," you know"
10702.900,10706.100," just this cascade of footballs behind me"
10707.100,10711.600," as I sat facing the wall actually then styled you know traditional is any sit facing the wall"
10712.300,10714.200," close to the wall so that out of the way"
10714.700,10715.000," and just"
10715.500,10715.700," you know"
10716.400,10718.300," cascades of people pouring past"
10718.800,10720.400," it was it was fascinating you know"
10721.100,10723.000," actually I could be perfectly"
10724.400,10724.800," deep"
10725.300,10726.800," dill at peace clear"
10727.300,10728.500," doesn't letting the experience"
10728.900,10729.300," flow through"
10729.900,10731.400," in you know without any"
10731.900,10732.300," problem"
10733.100,10733.200," and"
10734.400,10735.100," you know occasionally I"
10735.700,10735.900," got"
10736.400,10736.600," you know"
10737.000,10740.100," called things if it was just part of the stream you know"
10743.700,10748.000," but you know rather than thinking oh my gosh I can't do it now gotta have an ideal spot"
10748.700,10749.700," no you know we just do it"
10750.200,10750.900," when and where we can"
10752.100,10754.200," and as somebody who used to travel a lot"
10755.600,10756.800," got I got very used to that"
10757.600,10757.700," you know"
10758.700,10759.900," actually I think there's something"
10760.600,10762.700," I would feel that I could go to a place"
10764.100,10765.900," and the time I spent"
10766.800,10768.200," not looking around"
10769.600,10770.600," just sitting"
10771.300,10771.800," and being"
10772.600,10778.000," present to whatever was a rising in in my field of experience just as it was"
10778.700,10781.400," I felt I would get a better sense of the place"
10782.600,10783.500," you know I'd be"
10784.800,10785.600," because I did I used to"
10786.900,10792.200," in my life as a writer for various times I would I would write for magazines that would send me"
10792.900,10797.700," places you know that being interacting and engaging with people of course and seeing all kinds of stuff"
10798.400,10802.600," but every day I always would do my morning and evening meditation wherever I happen to be"
10803.100,10803.300," boom"
10803.900,10807.200," you know and I mean not in Mid conversation or something you know but"
10808.800,10809.500," but you know"
10809.900,10811.600," hotel or yard or whatever"
10812.300,10812.800," side of the road"
10813.300,10815.500," and there's times are just being still"
10816.600,10817.700," and just hearing"
10818.500,10821.000," what is going on in this community if you just listen"
10822.100,10826.700," you know and the community might be human but it also might be all kinds of critters you know"
10827.300,10830.100," or maybe trees or whatever it is you know all the above"
10831.000,10833.000," just listening to it absorbing it"
10833.800,10834.300," actually was a"
10834.900,10836.100," I think a deeper way"
10836.800,10838.600," a big of kind of sensing"
10839.500,10842.800," you I used to I felt sometimes I was like a wine taster"
10843.700,10846.200," but I was so tasting atmosphere"
10846.700,10847.700," of different places"
10848.200,10850.200," because I was meditating in them"
10851.000,10852.100," like I could see what's this"
10853.100,10854.000," what's this really"
10855.000,10856.500," like yeah I mean walking around the streets"
10858.000,10860.700," but actually it was when I was still on a bench"
10862.500,10863.100," for 20 minutes"
10864.000,10864.500," ah"
10865.300,10867.500," now I've got a sense of where I am"
10868.500,10868.600," you know"
10869.500,10870.300," it would be a kind of"
10871.700,10874.400," almost as a kind of like I was saying earlier I'd go to Germany"
10875.000,10876.100," is it in the you know"
10876.500,10878.900," facing the wall or whatever just sit still all that time"
10879.600,10880.000," but actually"
10880.700,10884.200," really it's it's I used to do the same going to train in Japan"
10885.500,10890.200," you know I'd be on the plane chatting with somebody who's going to see all these temples in Kyoto and"
10890.900,10893.000," this garden and that garden is restaurants there"
10894.300,10896.100," what are you doing well actually I'm"
10896.800,10901.000," yeah I'm going to come Acura and what are you going to see that well I'm actually just going to see a wall"
10901.400,10904.500," right in front of me let me sitting in the center"
10905.100,10907.700," but but I have a very deep sense of"
10908.100,10911.100," of that little neighborhood of kamakura"
10911.400,10912.900," that I've sat in a lot"
10914.100,10914.500," you know the"
10916.000,10920.600," the zendo that I would go to is is in a neighbourhood and you know it's a traditional thing"
10921.800,10924.600," that you just they just have louvered shutters"
10925.000,10926.900," you know and actually not glass"
10927.500,10928.100," it was just about"
10929.000,10932.900," seven years ago I think for the first time they actually put windows in this building you know"
10933.600,10937.600," but previously it was just so that it's totally permeable"
10938.400,10941.100," to the sounds of the neighbourhood you'd hear washing and"
10942.000,10944.000," and you know and cooking and"
10944.900,10947.000," and chat and laughed her"
10948.000,10953.400," the odd sharp voice you know and it just here in the cars in going by the end of the road and"
10955.400,10955.500," and"
10956.100,10957.400," you'd get steeped"
10958.300,10958.800," in a place"
10959.700,10960.400," more deeply"
10961.600,10962.000," that way"
10964.200,10964.300," and"
10966.800,10968.900," yeah you sort of letting it in more"
10970.400,10972.700," which of course means that in some level it"
10973.100,10974.300," touches us more"
10975.100,10976.700," you know it's a more tender"
10977.300,10980.700," engagement actually it's more more loving really you feel"
10981.700,10983.400," I feel so loved for this"
10984.400,10984.700," little"
10986.000,10987.900," cul-de-sac in kamakura"
10988.800,10990.300," you know I walked through"
10991.700,10993.200," but I've also sat kind of"
10993.900,10994.400," deeply"
10995.100,10995.400," in it"
10997.100,10999.000," sort of another way of knowing this world"
10999.800,11001.500," that somehow can touch us even more"
11003.800,11007.100," mindfulness but also a bit of connection"
11007.600,11008.900," is the mindfulness"
11009.600,11010.200," helps us"
11010.900,11012.400," connect it helps us"
11013.000,11014.100," become more open"
11014.900,11016.600," it helps us realise"
11017.100,11018.100," that this body"
11018.800,11019.600," you know which is"
11021.100,11023.900," what is it's so many chemicals and"
11026.300,11028.500," whatever 10 trillion microbes or whatever"
11029.600,11034.400," 7 trillion sells I don't know all that stuff but actually they will kind of made of the same"
11036.800,11038.100," basically the same stuff"
11038.700,11039.400," as the planet"
11040.100,11041.700," then we set a pieces of the planet"
11042.800,11044.100," walking breathing talking"
11045.000,11045.700," hearing"
11046.600,11047.500," seeing you know"
11048.700,11052.000," with a T-shirt in front of me you are the universe experiencing itself"
11052.500,11053.800," a quite a degree very good teacher"
11056.600,11061.700," but it's actually it's actually you know we really are we're made of this planet you know so"
11062.200,11063.200," in some sense"
11067.400,11069.000," we can actually start to censor"
11069.800,11070.300," how much"
11070.900,11071.000," you know"
11071.700,11072.300," this body"
11072.800,11073.600," owes to"
11074.700,11075.800," the planet is made of"
11077.000,11077.500," you know and"
11078.800,11080.400," and of course lightwise are"
11081.400,11082.100," coming and going"
11082.800,11083.500," atmosphere"
11084.300,11085.000," you know we're sort of"
11086.000,11087.100," it's almost like we're sort of"
11090.400,11091.400," suckling infants"
11091.900,11093.400," sucking in air and out"
11093.700,11095.200," in out in out you know"
11096.200,11096.400," and"
11098.000,11101.600," and obviously the fluids the waters that we can't do with out and"
11102.000,11103.600," the warmth we can't do without"
11104.300,11104.700," we're"
11104.900,11107.400," we're we're in sometimes the coolness that"
11108.200,11108.900," we we can't do without"
11109.800,11110.000," would"
11110.500,11113.900," we want to have it's all you know we're just made of"
11114.900,11117.300," you know see how easy it is to think we're separate"
11118.600,11119.900," that this is my body"
11120.400,11121.100," mine"
11121.900,11123.000," what is that even mean"
11124.000,11126.500," you know this is skin and flashing bone and"
11126.700,11127.800," breathe and warmth and"
11129.100,11134.000," solidity and matter and fluidity water and watery nests and"
11134.600,11136.500," what am I talking about is mine"
11137.400,11138.400," what is that what does that mean"
11139.400,11140.800," you know I didn't make it"
11141.700,11143.700," who is this even assessing"
11144.100,11145.000," whether I made it or not"
11145.700,11146.100," who is it"
11146.500,11148.900," saying is mine who is saying is mine"
11152.500,11152.700," yeah"
11153.200,11157.100," I thought he might have an answer you know take that that's taking that home"
11157.400,11159.000," by the way that's his handwriting yeah"
11159.700,11159.900," um"
11164.400,11164.800," yeah so"
11165.600,11166.600," so the path"
11166.900,11167.000," this"
11167.600,11168.700," this single part of"
11169.400,11169.900," mindfulness"
11170.700,11171.600," connectedness"
11172.100,11173.200," support and action"
11173.700,11176.900," and absorption will be getting to is"
11177.800,11179.400," is the path of"
11180.600,11181.900," gradually going"
11183.400,11184.400," a little bit"
11185.300,11185.400," from"
11186.200,11186.700," separately"
11188.000,11189.900," to not quite so separate"
11191.100,11191.700," separate"
11192.100,11192.200," to"
11193.400,11194.700," a bit porous"
11196.000,11197.500," a bit permeable"
11198.500,11199.100," becoming"
11199.600,11201.600," a semipermeable membr"
11202.800,11204.200," I remember that term from science"
11206.400,11208.000," that you can just absorb a bit"
11208.500,11208.700," you know"
11209.500,11211.500," and it's just gradually"
11213.600,11215.700," wondering whether the construction"
11217.500,11218.900," of me and here"
11219.500,11220.600," skin barrier"
11221.100,11223.500," everything out the other side of the barrier not me"
11224.400,11226.200," whether that is in fact"
11227.600,11229.000," a thoroughly correct"
11229.400,11229.900," construction"
11231.000,11232.800," whether there might be alternatives"
11233.900,11235.000," in a just starting to"
11236.700,11237.400," unpick"
11238.100,11239.000," the certainty"
11242.300,11242.600," yeah"
11244.500,11244.700," okay"
11245.700,11246.000," thank you"
11246.600,11246.600," so"
11247.700,11248.600," next item"
11249.100,11249.700," on the agenda"
11250.500,11251.300," is um"
11254.000,11254.700," find a partner"
11256.000,11257.800," maybe when you had last time or maybe not"
11259.500,11259.800," and"
11262.400,11264.400," the question the prompt is going to be"
11266.200,11267.000," what are"
11269.300,11271.700," some of my obstacles to meditation"
11273.200,11273.900," okay and"
11274.500,11277.600," one what I suggest is that one of you speaks"
11278.100,11279.500," and the other one just listens"
11280.700,11281.000," and then"
11281.700,11282.700," I'll ring the bell"
11283.400,11285.100," I'll read it I'll ring a very loudly"
11285.700,11289.900," and so we'll we'll then switch and go the other about two minutes each way"
11290.300,11291.700," okay I'll give you a moment to find"
11292.500,11294.300," your partner trade names if you haven't already"
11388.800,11389.300," okay"
11392.300,11392.800," great"
11393.200,11393.400," great"
11394.500,11394.700," lovely"
11395.900,11396.500," lovely lovely"
11397.300,11397.600," um"
11398.600,11400.000," could we just hear a few"
11401.400,11402.300," a few findings"
11403.300,11405.400," of the common obstacles to meditation"
11406.900,11407.100," yeah"
11411.400,11411.800," understand"
11414.100,11416.900," self and object of an illusion and that"
11417.400,11418.800," really there's just one thing"
11419.300,11420.200," conceptually I understand"
11421.500,11423.000," you talk about it I'm like yes I'm there with"
11423.300,11423.300," you"
11424.800,11426.200," how do how do we feel"
11427.100,11429.600," yeah yeah yeah yeah"
11434.800,11435.000," okay"
11435.900,11440.500," okay I'm gonna repeat that this thing actually let's use the mic in future so everybody can"
11441.100,11441.100," so"
11442.100,11443.700," that was I'm sorry remind me in"
11444.200,11444.500," Mark"
11444.800,11445.700," Mark was saying"
11446.800,11450.500," he gets and I think it's shared with his partner that they get"
11451.400,11455.200," the idea that the self is an illusion and that there's there's some"
11455.900,11458.100," state or condition of non separate and is this"
11458.600,11460.100," transcend self and other"
11461.100,11464.600," they buy into that they agree that that's that sounds right"
11465.200,11467.300," but how do I actually get to feel"
11467.600,11469.600," it how do I actually get to experience it"
11470.300,11470.400," so"
11471.400,11475.600," I mean I think that's that's a sort of most critical question and and a great question"
11476.300,11478.600," and my answer is read my book"
11482.600,11488.600," oh do the way the app you know no I mean I'm kidding obviously yeah but but"
11489.100,11490.000," you're trying that yeah"
11490.800,11492.700," you're doing both okay all right it'll come"
11493.100,11493.300," I mean"
11494.400,11497.600," I mean my answer is almost like I would say it is that"
11497.900,11499.500," too rut part"
11500.000,11501.200," because there's a long as we're"
11501.900,11502.200," saying"
11503.000,11504.300," I want to experience"
11505.000,11506.600," that I'm not separate"
11507.200,11510.100," actually what we're saying is that I want to experience"
11511.100,11511.700," no self"
11512.800,11514.700," and you can hear the problem in that right"
11515.200,11517.700," and I was very natural I've done it for years myself"
11518.200,11523.200," after I discovered that reality of non known non-self Nan separatist"
11524.000,11526.100," you know and I've really thought I'd lost it"
11526.700,11529.300," for years I wanted to find it again"
11530.300,11534.000," and actually the construction I want to find is"
11534.900,11536.400," is part of the problem"
11537.200,11538.800," it is the same construction"
11539.400,11541.800," if it's the same a to b that a"
11542.400,11543.700," is here being me"
11544.400,11545.600," B is there"
11546.100,11547.100," not being me"
11548.000,11551.200," and I want to get from here to being from being me"
11551.900,11552.300," too"
11552.600,11554.100," the state of not being me"
11554.500,11555.200," but actually"
11555.800,11558.300," it's very it is kind of tricky"
11558.900,11561.100," and and as a very real question"
11561.800,11565.100," and it's someone that I suffered with a lot over the years of my training"
11565.600,11567.300," why can't I experience this again"
11568.100,11570.300," why can't I get this again"
11570.800,11572.800," get not being me"
11573.100,11574.900," but as long as I want it"
11575.400,11577.900," I'm being me wanting it"
11578.400,11580.500," and that is the root of the problem"
11580.800,11582.600," I mean that is the thing that have skills it"
11583.300,11583.900," I used to think"
11585.500,11587.300," because you know I had various"
11588.000,11591.700," as many of us will have done all will do in time"
11592.100,11592.900," glimpses of"
11593.400,11595.100," it suddenly arriving there"
11595.800,11596.600," hello that happened"
11597.200,11601.000," well one way it happened for sure is that I wasn't trying to get there"
11602.900,11603.200," right"
11603.700,11603.900," because"
11604.700,11607.600," and so there are methods that might help"
11607.900,11608.200," and"
11608.900,11611.200," then has them with its weird cohan's"
11612.500,11614.700," Tara varda Buddhism has it with"
11615.600,11621.000," various analyses of experience and one of the ones that they share actually"
11621.600,11623.800," mahayana and Zen is part of my"
11624.200,11627.200," you know you don't need this technicality there's different kinds of Buddhism okay"
11627.700,11632.100," but one place where they'll meet a lot of them is this thing called preference"
11633.700,11634.600," wanting something"
11635.400,11636.600," either wanting something"
11637.900,11639.600," that's present to stay"
11640.900,11643.300," all wanting something that isn't present"
11643.700,11644.100," to come"
11645.300,11645.600," or"
11646.200,11649.200," wanting something that is present to please go away"
11651.000,11655.100," or once something that isn't print present please not to come"
11655.900,11657.400," you know right that's preference"
11658.400,11660.600," and they actually they spell it out that clearly"
11662.600,11664.900," and as long as there's I mean preference"
11666.100,11666.800," for and against"
11668.700,11668.900," I mean"
11669.400,11670.500," gosh don't we live by"
11671.200,11675.600," oh he kind of basically living by what we want to have and don't want to have"
11676.700,11679.300," I don't want my son to be having a really hard time"
11680.400,11681.700," and I desperately want"
11682.400,11684.200," him to be a piece or I"
11684.700,11686.000," I desperately want"
11686.400,11688.700," my mum not to die yet please you know"
11689.200,11691.100," and and on and as well as you know"
11692.100,11693.800," gosh I had like to have the money to"
11694.300,11698.500," you know fix that that thing that's not working properly you know"
11699.000,11699.900," and on and on and on"
11700.700,11701.300," and we sort of"
11702.200,11702.900," we seen to"
11703.700,11707.900," be automatically conditioned or maybe with not automatic but anyway conditions"
11708.300,11709.600," to live by preference"
11710.400,11711.600," so it's very deep"
11712.800,11714.300," and it's quite difficult and"
11715.200,11718.000," we might say why I don't want to stop having preference"
11719.000,11721.100," preferences I I wouldn't I just sort of"
11722.100,11727.400," wouldn't I just die actually if I didn't want to have a meal and want to be warm enough and dry enough and"
11728.000,11728.500," so on you know"
11729.400,11729.500," so"
11730.500,11735.500," you know there's some complexity around it but basically if we can see"
11736.100,11737.500," preference operating"
11738.200,11740.600," if we can get to the point where we can actually"
11741.200,11742.200," experienced"
11742.900,11743.500," preference"
11744.600,11745.600," because normally we don't"
11746.400,11747.700," we just obey"
11748.700,11754.800," it you know it says want this okay want me I want to you know but can we actually learn to experience"
11755.500,11756.200," preference"
11756.900,11759.200," and the answer is in fact yes"
11760.700,11763.800," and if we learn to and the prime"
11764.100,11766.900," laboratory for studying preference"
11767.400,11769.000," I believe is meditation"
11769.400,11770.300," I might be wrong"
11770.800,11772.700," many of said that that it's a very good"
11773.300,11774.600," little Arena"
11775.400,11778.300," that we can create with daily practice where we get"
11778.800,11780.000," gradually over time we"
11780.500,11781.300," do get"
11781.900,11782.700," karma"
11783.500,11783.900," dead here"
11784.400,11786.900," the lens kind of gets clearer"
11787.500,11789.100," and we can start to see"
11790.000,11790.900," oh wow"
11792.200,11793.900," when I'm wanting something"
11794.600,11796.500," there's a little ache"
11797.000,11797.600," in here"
11799.300,11800.200," that wants to"
11801.600,11801.700," be"
11803.200,11808.000," that once satisfaction and it the only thing that will satisfy"
11808.600,11810.600," is that thing it wants"
11813.700,11815.400," we can start to see that"
11815.800,11816.500," operating"
11817.500,11819.200," and then we might notice"
11820.100,11820.900," that it's not"
11821.600,11822.100," true"
11823.200,11825.700," because we really want that cup of coffee"
11828.100,11829.600," there was a desperate need"
11830.100,11833.000," it was the only thing that would prevent this ache"
11833.700,11833.900," of"
11834.300,11834.900," wanting"
11835.900,11836.700," from carrying on"
11837.400,11838.700," it would shut up"
11839.000,11840.500," when it got a cup of coffee"
11841.100,11843.000," all the cup of tea if you prefer tea"
11843.500,11846.300," the Irish breakfast tea with a little splatter half and half"
11846.600,11847.900," that's what I want you know"
11848.700,11849.800," and I really want it now"
11850.500,11851.700," and then five minutes later"
11852.200,11852.600," wait a minute"
11853.800,11855.700," where's that yearning for the cup of tea got"
11856.300,11856.900," is this gone"
11858.200,11860.700," it's said it would only be satisfied by the cup of tea"
11861.300,11862.600," and that was the only thing that would end it"
11863.400,11864.500," but suddenly it's not here anymore"
11865.000,11865.500," how did that"
11866.400,11866.700," or"
11867.200,11868.500," it got the cup of tea"
11869.500,11871.800," and learn behold it's kind of still here"
11872.600,11873.700," because now it wants something else"
11875.200,11876.200," so it's not quite"
11876.700,11877.000," as"
11877.400,11879.000," honest as it appears to be"
11880.100,11881.500," because it appears to say"
11882.100,11882.900," nothing but that will"
11883.600,11884.600," make me satis"
11885.800,11888.200," anyway so there's a complexity to it as well"
11888.900,11892.700," but basically if we can start to experience pre"
11896.400,11896.700," I mean"
11897.600,11900.500," you know what you've heard me saying it's about allowing right"
11901.700,11903.900," so you don't need to get rid of prefe"
11904.800,11907.000," we just need to learn to allow"
11908.000,11909.900," it because actually when we allow it"
11910.500,11912.300," preference is so beautiful"
11912.900,11916.000," it's so beautiful this little egg arises in me"
11916.800,11918.700," saying I I need it I needed I needed"
11919.600,11921.200," it's sweet it's beautiful"
11922.800,11924.500," you know and I can just love it"
11925.400,11927.400," so coming back to the question"
11929.500,11932.600," starting to be more aware of preference is considered"
11933.500,11933.800," to be"
11935.000,11935.800," a very helpful"
11937.300,11940.300," I'd say kind of ingredient in the recipe"
11941.000,11943.100," that might bring about flashes of"
11944.100,11945.400," you know non-dual experience"
11945.900,11946.200," you know"
11947.200,11949.700," but at the same time there is no short far away"
11952.000,11955.700," the only short far thing is that probably as long as I'm really wanting it"
11957.100,11957.700," it won't show up"
11959.100,11961.400," but even that's not sure fire"
11962.100,11963.600," there is no chauffer"
11963.900,11965.100," they say in Zen"
11965.800,11967.400," if you walk in the mist"
11968.000,11968.600," you get wet"
11969.900,11972.400," and we don't realise we're walking in the mist but we are"
11974.100,11975.100," so you know so"
11975.700,11977.800," I think there's um I used to think it's like"
11980.300,11982.400," I see if I could get this metaphor right"
11983.800,11985.800," I remember feeling that I never got it quite right"
11986.200,11989.500," but it's it's like Imagine there's a bowl of some solution"
11990.200,11996.000," and you know it's evaporating meaning that molecules are jumping out of it all the time alright I think that's what evaporation is that"
11997.000,11997.900," any chemists here"
11998.400,11999.300," please correct me if I'm wrong"
11999.700,12001.400," but I think basically evaporation is"
12002.000,12005.600," because water might if it's water water molecules are in motion and"
12006.000,12008.400," some of them are jumping out of the bowl and give it long enough and"
12009.000,12011.300," that all jump out well when does the bowl go from"
12013.200,12013.700," a little bit"
12014.500,12015.300," moist to"
12015.800,12016.300," dry"
12016.600,12017.700," it's just one molecule"
12018.200,12018.700," jumps"
12019.400,12020.900," and I think it's the same with"
12021.700,12022.400," Awakening"
12023.000,12023.100," that"
12023.900,12026.000," I'm seven I'm seven I'm separate world's out there"
12026.700,12028.600," it's only one molecule"
12029.300,12030.700," is the tiniest thing"
12031.300,12032.800," and suddenly it's it's the illusion"
12033.600,12034.300," has gone"
12034.900,12039.100," it's it's so tiny and I think the reason it's so tiny let me see okay"
12039.500,12041.400," I'm free and I'm switching metaphors here"
12042.000,12046.400," I do a lot of that but I wish I could be a little bit more disciplined with your metaphors Henry"
12046.700,12047.500," but here's another one"
12048.300,12053.000," just imagine it like this there's a lake and there's a mountain the other side of it forested"
12053.400,12054.900," and there on a lake is this"
12055.300,12056.100," perfect reflection"
12057.300,12058.800," of the Mountain covered in trees"
12059.700,12062.900," crystal Clear mountain lake no wind perfect reflection"
12064.200,12064.300," how"
12064.700,12064.900," thick"
12065.600,12066.400," is that reflection"
12072.100,12074.200," it's not even a molecule thing right"
12077.400,12078.300," and it's so real"
12078.900,12082.200," apparently I mean okay it's inverted but it looks very convincing"
12084.000,12086.700," but it's not even a thick as a single molecule"
12089.100,12090.900," what if the sense of self"
12091.700,12092.700," is equally"
12095.100,12095.800," quick silver"
12096.900,12099.000," it as seen as as"
12099.600,12101.100," however thin"
12101.700,12103.100," the image on a lake is"
12105.100,12111.300," now Henry or wrong my sense of self is much thicker than that I can feel it right here"
12111.700,12112.600," it's not budging"
12113.100,12114.100," it's been here all along"
12114.900,12122.000," I know it I kind of love it but now I'm meditating so I hate it and you know and I know I've got to get rid of it but I don't know how to"
12126.800,12130.900," what if it's no thicker no more solid no more real"
12131.500,12131.600," than"
12134.000,12135.700," that image of the mountain on the mountain lake"
12142.200,12142.900," and what if"
12144.800,12146.700," he had just don't have to get rid of it"
12150.500,12152.000," you just don't have to get rid of it"
12156.200,12160.200," again that's why I believe in this path of allowing and loving actually"
12162.600,12163.200," love it"
12164.200,12164.700," is really"
12166.300,12170.100," again there's no short far away but you'll be more comfortable loving it you know"
12170.800,12171.200," on"
12171.800,12172.900," the yeah right"
12173.300,12173.900," alright yeah"
12174.600,12174.600," so"
12175.800,12176.000," yeah"
12176.400,12178.500," okay so any other things that came up"
12179.200,12181.200," and Luke could we have a mic so that"
12181.800,12183.500," zoomers can hear it as well"
12183.800,12184.800," yeah yeah"
12185.500,12186.000," thanks"
12186.500,12188.100," wait wait wait for the mic so"
12189.400,12190.000," yeah I hear it"
12196.200,12196.400," just"
12199.300,12200.700," so many"
12201.700,12202.600," meditation that"
12204.800,12205.600," myself who I am"
12206.500,12206.600," you know"
12207.200,12207.400," and"
12207.900,12208.200," not"
12208.700,12209.000," exactly"
12209.700,12211.300," knowing what I should do and"
12211.900,12212.900," if I'm doing that"
12215.000,12216.400," yeah so kind of a double"
12217.400,12218.000," question like"
12218.600,12220.000," what methodology"
12220.400,12221.100," methodology"
12221.500,12222.900," is it better for me to pursue"
12223.400,12223.600," and"
12224.200,12226.700," and am I doing it right which everyone it might be"
12227.400,12227.600," yeah"
12228.400,12228.500," yeah"
12233.600,12234.300," so"
12235.000,12235.300," okay"
12236.900,12238.000," well the second part"
12239.900,12241.600," is a bit easier because"
12243.200,12243.700," whatever"
12244.800,12246.000," whatever method"
12246.700,12247.700," we might pick up"
12250.900,12253.000," yeah it's gonna teach us"
12254.700,12255.000," that"
12258.300,12261.100," wait let me just get my let me just check I'm saying what I want to say"
12262.900,12264.000," what would be most helpful here"
12264.900,12266.000," by and large"
12267.000,12269.100," trying to do the methods perfectly"
12270.100,12270.400," will"
12271.900,12273.100," just mess us up"
12274.000,12276.400," and they'll kind of go further and further away"
12277.700,12277.700," so"
12278.400,12279.200," understanding"
12280.000,12282.000," the meaning of the word practice"
12283.000,12284.700," you know imagine if somebody wanted to be"
12285.600,12288.000," playing Mozart in a concert hall of the piano"
12288.800,12292.500," and they start by saying why can't I do Mozart perfectly now"
12293.300,12294.900," obviously it's a part of"
12295.700,12297.800," gently practicing and developing"
12298.800,12299.800," yeah that makes sense"
12300.700,12300.800," and"
12301.300,12302.000," they say in"
12303.400,12304.800," in some"
12306.500,12308.100," I think there's some judo"
12309.100,12310.800," lineage or studio in Japan"
12311.400,12312.900," where the first three years"
12313.600,12315.400," the only thing you learn"
12315.700,12316.800," is how to fall down"
12318.500,12320.600," no throws just falling down"
12322.000,12323.300," and they say and then"
12324.200,12325.900," fall down seven times"
12326.400,12327.800," get up eight times"
12328.600,12330.400," fall down 7000 times"
12331.200,12331.600," get up"
12332.100,12333.200," 70001"
12333.700,12334.000," times"
12335.300,12335.800," that's it"
12336.300,12337.300," so we expect"
12338.000,12339.500," that whatever method we might be"
12340.600,12343.300," following may whether it's let's say it's counting the breath"
12344.600,12345.700," you're not expected"
12346.400,12349.200," to get from one to 10 if it's that if that's the system"
12350.700,12352.000," you're just not expected to do"
12353.000,12353.700," getting to 10"
12354.900,12355.500," again and again and again"
12357.400,12358.600," the expectation"
12359.000,12360.100," is that you'll discover"
12361.100,12362.500," something about your mind"
12363.300,12365.200," which is that it likes to wonder"
12366.200,12368.600," it goes to the past it goes to the Future"
12369.300,12372.800," it goes to imagine futures it goes to imagine pasts"
12373.600,12376.000," we could spend a lot of time changing the past"
12377.000,12378.100," editing the past"
12380.900,12385.400," redoing the past I go to poet friend who says if he ever wrote A Memoir"
12385.800,12388.300," it would be caused my plans for the past"
12393.000,12394.900," he's a great poet actually Sam Willits"
12395.600,12397.500," he's got a one book only called"
12398.400,12401.600," new light for the old dog it's a beautiful poetry book"
12406.600,12406.800," yeah"
12408.200,12411.100," so we're learning about ourselves through a press so the practice"
12411.900,12414.500," I think every practice is sort of dual purpose"
12415.000,12415.900," it's number one it's"
12416.600,12419.200," yeah can you can you see if you can stay with the breath"
12419.900,12423.300," and actually if you do start to stay with the breath it's really nice you can get"
12423.900,12425.700," carried by the breath into very deep"
12426.000,12427.900," beautiful states of absorption"
12428.400,12431.300," and it could be very lovely and that's valuable it's good for the system is"
12431.900,12434.100," if in any all you'll make discoveries about"
12435.000,12435.100," what"
12435.600,12437.700," deep absorption can feel like yourself and it's good"
12438.600,12439.400," and at the same time"
12440.000,12442.400," you'll fail to do all the above and that's good too"
12443.100,12444.800," because you're learning about your own mind"
12448.200,12449.600," but I did not answer the first question"
12450.600,12452.300," I kind of just put it on hold from a moment"
12453.100,12453.200," because"
12454.100,12455.000," let me just say that"
12455.500,12458.600," the map I have in this book and actually on the way as well"
12460.300,12462.200," is intended to show"
12463.500,12466.200," the major possibilities of meditation"
12467.000,12468.000," in four"
12468.300,12468.900," main"
12469.200,12469.800," areas"
12470.700,12472.500," and they do involve"
12473.500,12475.500," somewhat different approaches to practice"
12476.600,12478.800," generally not always but generally"
12480.000,12481.200," and I think it's valuable"
12482.100,12482.400," for"
12484.300,12487.500," a beginner meditator or novice meditator and even"
12488.400,12489.800," a long time meditator"
12490.700,12493.100," to know about these different areas"
12493.400,12493.600," because"
12494.500,12495.400," I've known people"
12496.400,12496.500," who"
12497.500,12497.900," actually"
12498.800,12501.500," didn't realise that one of these possibilities"
12502.600,12503.400," was was around"
12504.200,12507.300," even though they'd meditative for 30 years in a certain way"
12508.800,12511.600," there's I could give lots of examples of that the"
12512.300,12513.800," these Asian traditions"
12514.800,12518.200," you know a fantastic but they tend to be a little bit geographical"
12518.900,12520.700," and a little bit sort of siloed"
12521.300,12522.100," and then at all"
12523.200,12527.400," they're probably isn't one that covers all bases you know but here we are in the West"
12528.200,12528.800," and we're"
12529.600,12533.900," in this strange Crucible where all the Asian traditions are meeting each other"
12534.800,12538.100," not only are we westerners encountering meditation"
12538.700,12539.400," but but"
12540.400,12540.900," the"
12542.500,12546.300," different traditions in Asia are encountering one and encountering one another"
12546.800,12552.300," and so we're you know a lot is changing and fermenting and fertilizing in the world of meditation right now"
12552.800,12556.100," because it's all meeting Western science as well on top of all that you know"
12556.600,12558.000," globalised Western size"
12558.500,12558.600," so"
12559.800,12566.900," um it is a time when we could look at it oh man yeah there's mindfulness and all the stuff I've been talking about with my for this great"
12567.400,12568.300," but there's also"
12569.300,12569.900," Awakening"
12570.900,12571.600," non-dual"
12571.900,12572.400," you know and"
12572.900,12576.200," actually you can be deep in mindfulness for 30 years and not here about"
12576.600,12577.700," non-dual Awakening"
12578.500,12580.100," and vice versa as well"
12581.300,12581.500," so"
12582.700,12582.800," okay"
12583.800,12585.400," that hopefully that's enough for now yeah"
12585.800,12585.900," yeah"
12586.500,12586.800," ma"
12598.600,12599.100," my partner"
12600.200,12600.700," sorry"
12602.000,12606.100," yeah it would be saying that sometimes"
12607.400,12608.100," he is finished"
12608.400,12609.800," let's say absorption"
12609.900,12610.100," and then"
12610.500,12610.700," search"
12612.200,12612.200," the past"
12612.500,12613.400," can I really in it"
12613.800,12616.000," and I really experiencing it and I'm going to add a"
12616.500,12617.200," variant on"
12617.800,12618.000," that"
12618.500,12618.700," question"
12620.800,12621.400," I haven't maybe had"
12622.100,12622.600," you know two"
12624.300,12626.500," positive meditation experiences that"
12626.800,12628.100," maybe only a one or two that are"
12629.500,12629.800," true the"
12630.700,12632.500," kind of almost transported"
12634.600,12634.900," so"
12635.800,12637.800," but before I meditated"
12639.300,12639.700," reality"
12640.700,12640.900," had a six"
12643.300,12645.200," truly transformative spiritual experiences"
12646.100,12649.400," I wouldn't necessarily use the words that you use to"
12650.400,12653.300," describing Awakening but I have written actually"
12654.000,12654.900," how calculated that they"
12656.500,12659.000," were personal from 9911 who doesn't want in the"
12659.500,12662.100," seventh was on 9/11 2022"
12662.700,12664.000," exactly 21 years later"
12664.800,12665.100," and they're"
12665.600,12668.700," characterized by Deep insects into my life very good"
12669.200,12670.800," thought complete lack of critic"
12671.500,12672.000," um"
12673.400,12675.100," or as they talked about"
12676.300,12678.400," an imitation thinking without knowing that you're thinking"
12679.100,12681.200," feeling of these connection to other people"
12682.700,12682.800," and"
12684.000,12685.800," urge the common understanding of"
12686.700,12689.100," connection with other people being able to read their body language and"
12689.500,12690.800," the way of baseball player talk"
12690.900,12692.100," about a ball torturing the"
12693.700,12694.600," plate very slowly"
12695.600,12696.600," that sense of connection"
12698.000,12701.300," a lack of interest in pleasures like teen sex drugs"
12702.400,12702.500," and"
12704.600,12706.900," inability to see I usually spend the time writing"
12707.800,12708.000," and"
12708.800,12709.700," so I guess my question is"
12710.600,12712.400," are these experiences like are they"
12713.300,12714.100," likely Awakening"
12716.000,12718.800," I was the one know what it what is Awakening versus absorption and"
12719.200,12719.300," yeah"
12719.900,12721.100," yeah okay that's a great question"
12721.700,12724.200," did everybody hear that by the way yeah it's about"
12724.800,12724.900," having"
12725.800,12728.200," certain really important experiences"
12729.100,12731.600," and where to fit them into the map"
12731.900,12732.700," something like that yeah"
12733.300,12738.000," it's you know at this distance and with just that sketch I wouldn't be 100% confident"
12738.600,12741.800," and but but what I really want to say here is like"
12742.700,12743.700," any time"
12744.100,12748.400," that our customary where processing experience is interrupted"
12748.800,12756.300," and there's some sense that some kind of light I mean it doesn't have to feel like some kind of illuminated some kind of clarity some kind of understanding"
12756.900,12758.600," that we don't ordinarily have"
12759.300,12759.800," comes in"
12760.500,12762.100," that is tremendous"
12762.700,12766.400," and that's what we want to be trusting because that's a face of original love"
12766.900,12767.700," so I'm you know"
12768.200,12768.800," I'm I'm trying to"
12769.400,12771.700," I'm trying to do it's a very complex field"
12772.100,12775.900," okay and so we can say certain things certain things clearly"
12776.500,12777.000," we can"
12777.700,12779.200," but there's a lot of complexity"
12779.700,12779.700," so"
12780.200,12780.700," actually"
12782.800,12787.000," I believe in the Map that I've laid out in the book and on there is as being"
12787.600,12790.000," important because it's making some"
12791.000,12799.300," it's it's a realm of confusion at the moment in the Western I'm trying to lay out a bit of clarity look hey there it's not all the same if you have"
12799.900,12804.700," a beautiful moment of this of the of The equanimous Witness"
