32.300,33.600," very juicy"
34.600,41.500," and in a moment I'll hand you over to Henry but as always we'd love to hear from you first so please drop a line in the chat"

93.600,94.200," we have a"
95.900,97.800," poem or a poem there"
99.600,100.900," coming in from menlo Park"

128.700,130.400," all over the globe"
132.800,133.300," all right"
133.700,134.800," I'm going to"
136.500,139.500," turn you over to Henry now"
140.600,143.300," yeah Sarah thank you so much and thank you everybody"
144.100,145.000," I've actually been"
146.100,148.600," with checking in as well on this lovely chats"
150.600,151.700," great to be gathering"
152.900,154.400," as always like this for"
156.500,159.500," I was going to say for the purpose of just being"
160.700,161.300," but in a way"
162.000,162.500," it's almost"
163.200,163.600," finding"
164.500,166.300," the purpose is Finding"
167.200,168.900," this great purpose that is"
169.500,170.800," almost purpose less"
171.500,172.600," the great unfolding"
173.300,173.900," you know which is"
174.500,175.400," by some reckonings"
176.100,177.300," are called the Dharma"
177.900,181.900," the Dharma is lots of different things than word has lots of different meanings"
182.800,184.300," but among them"
185.300,186.500," is the meaning that it is"
187.200,189.200," the unfolding of all the way"
189.900,194.100," you almost say the order or the logic by which all things unfold"
194.800,195.000," and"
196.300,197.700," last week we had"
198.400,199.700," Michael taft on"
200.700,200.800," who"
201.800,204.200," I I personally thought was just magnificent"
204.900,207.000," and I hope I got the impression that"
207.700,208.000," that"
209.100,211.100," you know he went that he went down very well"
211.800,212.400," with everybody"
212.900,217.900," if you weren't owned by the way don't miss the recording of his time it was really it was really spectacular"
218.800,222.000," um but in there there was this marvelous comment he made"
222.700,223.000," about"
224.400,225.600," experiencing"
226.600,227.400," thought"
228.400,228.800," as"
229.500,231.700," something in his body he said and"
232.500,234.400," there was a comment from somebody about"
236.100,238.200," finding that really inspirational and"
238.900,241.600," and getting this sense I mean I don't know that I"
242.300,243.000," I fully"
244.000,247.000," understood this correctly but it sounded in the comment like there was a"
247.400,248.200," there was a sense of"
248.900,251.800," realizing that the way thoughts unfold"
253.000,254.400," has a kind of logic"
254.900,255.200," or"
256.300,257.100," a kind of"
258.500,260.700," order in it that corresponds"
261.400,264.100," exactly to the order or logic"
264.700,267.000," by which many other things unfold"
268.600,270.000," and that too is the Dharma"
271.400,271.500," and"
273.800,276.600," so Gathering like this is an opportunity"
277.900,279.000," for us to let go"
279.600,280.100," of our"
282.600,284.100," self based or personal"
286.700,288.800," agendas you know our personal"
290.000,291.300," well self based"
291.800,293.900," understandings of how things operate"
295.100,296.100," and releasing that"
297.100,299.100," and finding that we're already part of"
300.300,302.900," another kind of larger order"
303.400,304.000," of things"
305.400,307.700," and it's it's a beautiful thing to have"
308.400,309.500," that shift from"
310.400,310.900," you know the"
311.400,311.700," the"
312.800,314.100," more constrained view"
315.200,316.000," the more Limited"
316.900,317.600," view to"
318.800,320.500," oh wow there's a larger"
322.700,323.100," purpose"
323.900,325.600," except that it's not exactly a purpose"
326.300,327.500," is a larger order"
328.400,330.000," by which things unfold"
330.700,332.100," and that's part of what"
332.900,335.000," the this thing we call Awakening"
335.800,336.300," is about"
338.500,339.600," but when but we"
340.500,341.700," the title of this"
342.300,344.500," series is undoing and undoing"
345.100,346.200," factors of Awakening"
347.100,347.900," because it's not"
349.000,351.400," unlike so many other things in life this"
352.800,353.100," this"
354.500,356.300," quest or this purpose or this"
357.200,358.500," search for"
359.000,360.600," a deeper kind of well-being"
361.900,363.100," and even really"
363.800,364.400," a deeper"
365.600,367.800," or some sort of underlying goodness"
368.900,369.500," in things"
370.100,371.200," which often seems"
372.300,373.400," thoroughly obscured"
374.000,374.100," and"
374.600,375.500," very implausible"
376.100,377.900," when we look at the way the world is"
379.000,379.200," but"
379.600,382.600," according to these deep traditions and there"
383.300,384.900," practitioners who devoted"
386.100,387.200," so much time and energy"
388.400,391.000," to what they have to offer to the wisdom they have to offer"
392.000,393.400," it's never gone"
394.300,397.700," the base there is a basic goodness that's never gone"
398.500,399.400," and really are"
399.900,401.600," our job as human beings"
402.300,403.200," from that perspective"
404.800,407.300," is to learn how to be more open"
408.500,409.600," to that basic goodness"
410.400,410.900," how to have"
412.500,413.200," swiftor"
413.600,414.600," and more consistent"
415.100,415.600," access"
416.100,416.400," to it"
416.700,418.100," because it's never gone"
419.700,421.500," and from it's perspective"
421.900,424.000," everything that happens is an unfolding"
425.000,425.300," is a"
426.100,426.500," is a is a"
427.500,428.500," is a process"
429.400,430.300," unfolding"
431.600,431.900," that"
432.500,433.800," comes out of"
434.700,435.900," yeah whatever that"
436.800,439.200," basic fundamental underlying"
439.600,440.300," original"
440.700,441.200," goodness"
441.900,443.700," is that they're not just in US"
445.300,446.100," but in all things"
447.700,448.500," including us"
448.800,450.100," and the fact that we're part of it"
450.900,451.800," is actually"
452.400,453.800," the fundamental well-being"
454.400,454.900," that we have"
455.900,456.800," so anyway that's all"
457.300,459.000," a little bit of a sort of a"
459.700,460.600," rapid fire"
461.000,462.500," intro to what will be doing"
463.100,463.300," today"
464.100,464.900," and over"
465.700,466.100," the next"
466.500,467.600," well this and the next two"
468.700,469.500," I can't write"
470.000,472.300," these 3 sessions that we're having"
474.300,475.400," this one and the next two"
475.900,476.200," will be"
477.100,478.000," exploring"
479.500,482.600," what this business of Awakening really is about"
483.000,483.400," what it is"
484.100,484.300," and"
485.700,486.800," what some of its"
487.900,490.100," mysterious and not so mysterious"
490.800,491.400," factors"
492.000,494.000," might be in others the factors"
495.400,496.400," that may help us"
497.400,497.900," realise"
498.700,499.200," we're already"
500.100,500.500," part of it"
502.200,502.400," okay"
503.400,503.600," so"
504.000,505.300," one of those factors"
506.400,506.800," well"
507.200,509.300," a tested I think we can say"
509.700,510.500," is meditation"
510.900,511.100," yeah"
512.300,514.100," if we have a regular"
514.700,515.900," meditation practice"
517.700,518.500," it somehow"
520.400,521.800," wears us down a bit"
522.200,524.400," it makes us a bit thinner I think it's like"
525.500,528.800," a carpet that's been walked on for several generations"
529.800,531.400," you know it gets very thread back"
532.000,532.900," and you start to see"
533.800,535.500," the the weave within"
536.100,537.700," the shag of the carpet"
538.500,541.400," and you know that's a bit like"
542.100,543.400," having the daily meditation"
544.200,547.900," walk on us we get more thread back in a very good way"
548.800,550.900," we get in fact undone"
551.500,552.800," we do the meditation"
553.600,554.300," but at the same time"
555.200,556.800," it's undoing us"
558.600,558.600," so"
559.800,562.100," the the the the the key thing is"
563.200,563.700," every day"
564.400,565.400," at least a little bit"
566.400,566.900," but also"
567.900,569.200," letting it do the work"
570.300,575.100," that's the heart of this approach really as a method this original lover approach"
575.600,576.800," is doing less"
577.200,577.600," letting"
578.200,579.000," it do the work"
581.200,581.300," so"
581.900,586.200," let's come into by the way if you haven't joined one of these sessions before"
587.000,590.200," and the typical format with is we have a sit"
591.200,593.200," little break and then I offer"
594.200,598.900," some some you know some encouraged hope encouraging words"
599.700,601.600," and and then we have given a"
602.600,602.700," and"
605.700,607.100," let's come into"
608.100,609.400," our comfortable position now"
609.800,610.400," for meditation"
614.600,615.600," but we'll"
616.100,619.200," sit in the order of 25 to 30 minutes"
621.600,624.800," and they'll be the opportunity to sit a bit longer if you if you"
625.600,626.400," if you prefer"
626.900,628.800," as we have a break right after the sit"
629.800,629.900," and"
630.500,630.700," some"
631.800,633.300," choose to use that for more sitting"
635.400,635.700," so let's"
637.200,638.000," find our way"
639.300,641.300," rather gently and kind of loosely"
642.000,643.400," not too rigidly"
644.000,645.100," find our way to"
646.000,646.700," a comfortable"
647.700,648.300," upr"
650.000,650.400," position"
651.500,654.100," and if you prefer to be reclining"
654.800,655.900," absolutely do it"
656.100,658.400," if that feels like it's the right thing for you now"
659.500,660.200," go right ahead"
661.000,661.400," you could be"
662.700,664.300," leaning back into a sofa"
665.400,667.400," it could be flat on your back on the floor"
668.700,669.300," or on a bed"
670.400,671.400," whatever works for you"
672.200,675.800," but I'm gonna offer a little bit of body guidance"
676.500,677.900," some of which will be"
679.500,682.700," assuming that you're sitting up right so just exert"
683.600,684.700," whenever it doesn't apply to you"
687.900,689.100," so yeah let's begin"
691.100,691.800," very gently"
697.100,700.600," with again assuming you're sitting up alright rock your body gently"
701.300,702.300," backwards and forwards"
704.500,706.200," at a PACE that works for you"
708.300,710.200," check that your spine is"
710.800,711.900," set up well"
713.800,716.700," and if again if you're sitting up right that means"
717.800,719.800," we want to have some lumbar are"
720.800,721.600," not too much"
723.400,725.300," but enough to create the"
726.800,729.000," kind of intrinsic"
729.500,731.200," structural strength"
732.500,733.600," of the spinal column"
735.600,737.700," it rests on that little bit of"
738.600,741.600," forward lumbar arts just a shade of a"
743.100,745.500," anterior tilt to the pelvis"
747.400,749.300," that's a little bit of a forward till"
750.200,751.700," creating the lumbar arts"
752.900,754.200," then let the shoulders be"
755.600,758.700," just a wee bit back a quarter inch back"
759.400,761.300," opening the chest just a little bit"
763.500,764.200," that the chin"
765.600,766.000," Tuck"
767.200,768.100," one millimetre"
770.700,771.900," just enough to"
775.100,777.200," create a slight length thinning"
778.300,779.400," in the back of the neck"
781.800,784.300," again it might only be half a millimetre"
786.100,786.900," just a little"
789.800,790.700," micro"
792.900,794.800," opening in the back of the neck"
800.100,801.500," see if you can stay with"
802.000,802.200," that"
804.200,807.300," that marginally lengths and back of the neck"
809.500,810.400," and at the same time"
811.900,813.000," release the jaw"
816.300,817.700," so the JW sinks"
820.200,822.000," a millimetre two millimetres"
828.500,830.800," and enough to bring a beautiful softness"
832.500,833.300," into the throat"
841.000,843.600," and let this be our q"
845.100,846.000," this softness"
849.200,851.000," this stillness"
853.300,856.400," perhaps the big Beginnings of a certain kind of"
857.200,858.200," spaciousness"
860.700,862.300," in this whole area"
863.800,866.200," cervical spine and neck"
868.300,869.400," and a jaw"
871.100,873.700," and the throat and the tongue too"
876.500,877.600," this whole region"
880.800,881.600," coming into"
883.900,886.100," a kind of spacious stillness"
887.800,888.700," and he's"
892.600,893.800," and letting that he's"
895.500,896.000," Bloom"
897.500,898.300," into the face"

1403.900,1404.700," and disappears"
1407.000,1407.800," or like a"
1408.800,1410.500," a cloud of ink in water"
1411.400,1413.100," from a square or something like that"
1413.700,1414.300," or an octopus"
1416.100,1417.400," a blooming cloud"
1418.800,1420.400," and then a diminishes to nothing"
1422.900,1424.300," and then again it balloons"
1426.200,1427.200," and diminishes"
1434.700,1436.000," quietly observing"
1437.800,1438.600," the breath"
1438.800,1439.200," process"
1469.400,1471.100," alright you don't have to do anything"
1473.600,1474.600," if your mind"
1475.800,1478.300," slips off the breath goes somewhere else"
1479.300,1480.400," it's no problem"
1483.400,1485.500," if it's into thought that it goes"
1487.000,1488.000," when you realise"
1489.300,1490.400," you've been thinking"
1492.200,1493.000," just note"
1493.500,1493.900," ah"
1495.300,1495.700," thinking"
1498.900,1499.500," all good"
1512.300,1513.700," all parts of"
1514.800,1515.900," the unfold"
1596.100,1596.400," so"
1597.500,1599.200," we can check in"
1600.200,1602.200," if if you're curious or"
1603.400,1605.900," you like to you can just check in"
1607.500,1608.700," with how you're doing"
1612.200,1614.600," what kind of condition are you in"
1622.200,1622.900," here's the"
1624.700,1626.400," the caravans awry"
1627.500,1628.500," the house of rest"
1631.800,1632.900," the place of rest"
1634.600,1636.100," for the wonder of the traveler"
1636.700,1637.400," the pilgrim"
1641.500,1642.100," how are they doing"
1649.900,1652.200," coming into the shade you know off the"
1653.600,1655.400," weary slog across the desert"
1656.400,1657.700," coming into the shade"
1660.900,1662.700," a courtyard with his fountain"
1663.200,1663.300," you know"
1666.200,1667.400," the couch with its"
1668.800,1670.700," camel blankets the rest"
1673.600,1674.400," of resting"
1675.600,1676.000," here"
1679.600,1680.400," how are they doing"
1687.100,1688.100," how are you doing"
1696.100,1700.800," can you release any sense that there's a certain way you should be"
1703.200,1704.300," and know that this"
1705.500,1707.900," guest house this house of rest"
1710.400,1711.000," can only"
1711.700,1713.100," take you as you are"
1714.000,1714.900," you know it only ever"
1717.000,1719.100," is interested in you as you are"
1721.500,1722.300," just as you are"
1729.700,1731.800," it'll take you any way you are"
1759.000,1759.800," one of the"
1762.100,1765.500," maybe strange features of Awakening is that it"
1768.400,1770.400," it has no conditions actually"
1778.200,1779.100," it's unconditional"
1792.300,1793.800," that's why we can't earn it"
1814.100,1815.000," seems to"
1818.100,1818.600," um"
1819.000,1820.300," open to us more"
1821.200,1821.900," the less we do"
1823.300,1823.800," somehow"
1875.200,1876.800," letting the stillness"
1878.900,1881.300," and the restfulness"
1884.900,1886.200," do whatever they need to do"
1901.600,1902.500," it's okay"
1903.800,1907.900," if if something uncomfortable comes up and you want to just kind of back off a bit"
1910.700,1911.800," that's fine of course"
1913.100,1914.000," feel your seat"
1914.800,1915.600," feel the support"
1920.300,1920.500," really"
1921.600,1923.600," whenever comes up we just let it"
1924.800,1925.400," Bloom"
1927.100,1927.900," come up and"
1929.100,1930.300," do it and thing"
1933.600,1936.300," just watch it as another process like the breath"
1954.900,1956.100," and letting things be"
1959.600,1960.800," and letting things be"
1967.600,1968.900," our part"
1970.600,1972.200," is to let things be"
2038.300,2040.800," often when we let things be they"
2041.900,2044.700," that bloom and then they kind of release themselves"
2047.100,2048.700," but we don't ask that they do that"
2051.500,2052.800," we just keep allowing"
2055.100,2055.500," allowing"
2059.600,2060.200," allowing"
2169.000,2170.500," notice if there's anything"
2172.000,2173.400," that you're resisting"
2175.000,2177.300," or notice if there's any trace of"
2178.100,2179.100," resistance"
2181.500,2184.400," not this that kind of feeling"
2185.700,2186.800," this isn't okay"
2189.900,2193.400," if you can find traces of something like that"
2195.000,2196.200," only allow them"
2198.400,2199.400," resistance"
2200.100,2200.500," Is"
2201.800,2202.300," welcome"
2208.800,2209.700," we allow"
2212.300,2213.300," it we welcome it"
2224.000,2228.600," if there's something coming up you think oh no this isn't right for meditation"
2230.400,2232.500," this doesn't belong in this meditation"
2234.200,2236.600," well actually it probably does"
2237.100,2237.200," but"
2238.600,2239.200," allow it"
2241.300,2242.100," allow it"
2243.500,2244.800," and also allow"
2245.800,2246.800," the resisting of it"
2293.400,2295.500,"what if meditation isn't some"
2296.400,2299.500," sacred Space where Only Good Things show up"
2300.900,2302.500," what if what makes it good"
2303.400,2304.500," is that everything"
2305.700,2306.400," is welcome"
2309.700,2311.400," it's truly a place"
2312.500,2313.600," of undoing"
2321.100,2322.000," when booting"
2323.000,2326.200," undoing of our ideas about what meditation should be"
2336.400,2339.000," so in our last moments"
2342.200,2343.200," see if you can"
2344.400,2345.700," undo"
2348.700,2349.200," or"
2349.500,2350.800," be undone"
2353.000,2353.500," or both"
2358.000,2359.300," or even neither"
2361.900,2362.700," beyond both"
2455.800,2458.200," so yeah we're actually going to"
2459.800,2462.200," move into break time"
2464.400,2469.400," but once again if you know if you want to just Cruise in your sitting just obviously do"
2471.000,2472.900," and if you feel like it's time for a"
2473.900,2474.700," a cup of tea"
2475.400,2475.500," to"
2476.700,2477.500," or stretch your legs"
2478.400,2480.200," please do and let's see we're now"
2481.300,2484.300," 40 win at 41 minutes past the hour and night to have"
2485.000,2488.700," just a bit more than five minutes so let's call it a seven minute break"
2489.600,2490.300," and we'll try to"
2491.400,2492.300," resume"
2493.400,2494.100," a bit before"
2495.200,2496.900," 50 minutes past the hour"
2498.300,2499.500," just to shade before that"
2501.000,2501.300," okay"
2503.000,2504.100," thank you very much everybody"
2816.200,2817.300,"hi hi everybody"
2817.800,2820.200," am I clearly audible I hope so"
2821.400,2821.700," yeah"
2822.000,2824.800," okay- good good well I hope everybody had"
2825.600,2827.000," a had a helpful sit"
2827.500,2828.000," just then"
2829.800,2831.300," always eager to hear"
2832.200,2833.200," how different"
2834.200,2837.000," aspects or kinds of guidance work you know"
2837.800,2838.200," and"
2841.100,2841.300," I"
2842.900,2846.400," I hope also that this this series is going to be helpful for you"
2847.600,2850.200," three sessions looking at factors of"
2850.800,2851.500," Awakening"
2852.200,2852.600," the doing"
2853.300,2854.200," and the undoing"
2854.900,2856.800," you know there's the practice that we do"
2858.100,2859.800," but actually when we"
2860.600,2862.800," sort of generate the power of practice"
2863.700,2865.200," that's probably"
2866.000,2868.900," the number one thing that knows how to undo us"
2869.500,2871.100," so we do on the one hand"
2871.800,2873.000," and we are undone"
2873.200,2873.900," on the other hand"
2875.000,2875.900," it's always that"
2877.200,2878.300," process of both"
2879.000,2880.000," action and"
2881.900,2882.600," receptivity"
2883.300,2883.500," of"
2884.900,2885.700," generative"
2886.200,2886.300," and"
2887.900,2889.700," recessive you know we we do"
2890.400,2891.100," and we receive"
2893.200,2894.100," that seems to be"
2895.000,2896.600," a kind of fundamental pattern"
2897.800,2898.100," of this"
2898.600,2899.000," path of"
2899.700,2900.100," development"
2901.000,2901.600," that has"
2902.900,2907.000," Fallen under the rubric or the overall heading of Awakening"
2908.500,2910.300," Awakening as a process"
2911.500,2914.900," Awakening as a Discovery that is not a process"
2916.300,2919.200," because it's the discovery of something that was always going on anyway"
2923.000,2923.300," and"
2924.900,2927.300," Awakening as a further process"
2928.000,2929.200," of integrating"
2930.000,2930.900," what has been discovered"
2933.400,2935.700," and even yet more as a process because"
2936.900,2937.100," the"
2938.200,2939.300," what is discovered"
2939.900,2940.600," in Awakening"
2941.500,2942.500," is actually not"
2943.200,2944.400," a static thing"
2946.000,2947.500," it's not as if there's this thing"
2948.600,2949.600," that we awaken to"
2951.100,2952.600," and it's just fixed"
2954.200,2955.000," static"
2956.300,2957.000," inert"
2958.700,2959.400," not at all"
2960.300,2962.700," is the most dynamic thing there is probably"
2963.500,2965.300," by possibly quite plausibly"
2965.800,2967.900," the most dynamic thing there is"
2971.400,2972.500," so where do we begin"
2974.000,2974.800," it's"
2975.400,2980.700," it's a it's a it's a it you know it's a it can be a very confusing kind of"
2981.700,2984.400," terrain territory it's terror incognito"
2984.900,2985.600," it really is"
2986.400,2988.800," How an earth do we begin how could anybody say"
2990.400,2992.600," what the map is how could anybody say"
2993.300,2994.400," even that there is"
2994.900,2997.600," an identifiable thing called Awakening"
2998.300,3000.900," one of the great old zen Masters talk asan"
3001.300,3002.600," you know student came to him"
3003.900,3007.900," and just pulling up the actual precise text of student came to him"
3008.600,3009.200," and said"
3011.900,3013.000," what is Bode"

3019.900,3020.400," he lived from"
3022.100,3028.000," something like eight nine Team to nine 14 let me just double check yeah"
3028.500,3030.100," eight 19 to 9"
3030.800,3031.200," 14"

3033.700,3034.300," to"
3035.100,3038.000," 9 14 so it kind of spanned almost the second half"
3039.100,3041.000," of the Tang Dynasty period"
3042.900,3045.500," not unusually long lived for"
3046.000,3048.300," those zen practitioners in those days they often"
3049.100,3051.600," seem to live to goodly Old eggs"
3052.800,3053.300," they had"
3054.200,3057.500," presumably relatively stress-free lives"
3058.200,3060.600," in the intra Montagne vallees where they lived"
3062.200,3064.000," you know living off healthy"
3064.400,3065.100," diet and"
3066.100,3068.500," and obviously meditating a fair bit"
3069.300,3069.600," and"
3071.200,3073.900," and sharing the fruits of their meditation"
3074.700,3076.800," with in multiple ways including"
3077.500,3078.400," teaching or guidance"
3079.200,3081.500," so deshan is up there in his Valley"

3102.600,3104.900," body is the noun Awakening"
3105.700,3108.900," the body mind is the Awakened mind or The Awakening mind"
3110.700,3113.500," body cheetah is The Awakening of the heart mind"

3120.300,3121.500," nice and Direct question"
3122.000,3122.900," often in Zen"
3123.500,3125.200," the questions are asking that"
3125.800,3126.400," but not so"
3127.100,3127.800," straightforwardly"
3128.200,3131.300," you know one question that comes up and then is"
3132.000,3135.200," why did Bodhi dharma come from India"
3136.200,3138.700," that's a more roundabout way of asking the same thing"
3139.000,3140.400," but he dharma was the Great"
3141.100,3143.100," Indian sage who is"
3144.300,3144.700," credited"
3145.300,3148.800," both in Legend and to some extent in history with bringing"

3216.400,3217.200," don't defecate here"
3218.400,3218.900," actually"
3220.000,3220.700," they shine"
3221.200,3221.500," is"
3222.000,3222.600," answering"
3223.700,3224.200," the students"
3225.000,3225.500," question"
3226.200,3228.600," she asks what is Awakening"
3229.300,3229.900," and he"
3230.900,3231.400," answers"
3236.100,3236.400," perfectly"
3237.700,3238.200," clearly"
3238.900,3239.500," there it is"
3240.600,3241.100," get out"
3242.800,3243.100," that's it"
3244.000,3244.300," actually"
3245.100,3245.700," it really is"
3246.300,3247.400," it really is showing"
3247.900,3248.600," awaken"
3249.800,3251.600," now there could be another level"
3253.000,3253.300," where"
3253.700,3254.800," the teacher is saying"
3258.900,3259.900," some sort of shock"
3260.200,3260.800," tactic"
3261.200,3261.400," you know"
3262.100,3263.200," maybe startled"
3264.600,3267.300," the person why what what's up you know"
3268.200,3268.800," Damien"
3269.700,3270.900," are normal process"
3271.900,3272.300," of"
3273.400,3274.800," learning whereby"
3275.300,3277.500," we think we approach something and"
3278.000,3279.000," trying to find out about it"
3279.500,3280.800," try to get a handle on it"
3281.300,3282.600," and try to understand it"
3283.100,3283.600," try to kind of"
3284.100,3285.600," assimilate it into"
3286.500,3290.000," our known way of being in the world"
3290.400,3291.400," here's another item"
3292.200,3292.800," Awakening"
3293.200,3294.000," I'm going to get it"
3294.900,3295.500," just like I"
3296.200,3298.400," you know got the new car but kind of thing"
3298.700,3302.900," I'm going to assimilate it into my world as I understand the world"
3303.900,3305.200," my version of the world"
3305.900,3308.000," can take in this thing called Awakening"
3309.300,3310.600," and accommodate it"
3312.200,3314.100," that seems to be the process"
3314.800,3316.500," that we might all think"
3317.200,3319.200," seems that maybe this student also thinks"
3320.000,3320.600," they can get"
3321.200,3321.900," this Awakening"
3322.300,3322.500," thing"
3324.500,3326.300," and that actually is a hint"
3326.800,3327.200," then the way"
3327.700,3330.200," they shine responds get out don't defecate here"
3330.700,3331.600," is a what he"
3332.000,3335.700," of getting a hint of what this whole business of Awakening"
3336.500,3336.900," is"
3338.100,3342.800," maybe there's a hint right there that is not in fact something that can be got"
3343.700,3344.800," it's not something"
3345.300,3347.200," that can be brought into"
3348.000,3349.500," our known world"
3351.000,3357.500," into a hole sense of what this world is and what life is of what not just me as a particular person but"
3358.300,3364.000," a bit of as a human being as a as an organism that's alive and this form called human and"
3364.700,3367.200," you know all of that and the way it experiences the world"
3367.700,3369.000," I'm going to bring into that"
3369.700,3370.700," this thing called awaken"
3371.900,3372.600," well actually"
3373.600,3374.200," that is"
3376.400,3377.000," even though"
3377.700,3381.600," the way we are this human form the human understanding of life"
3382.200,3383.600," is actually all part of"
3384.700,3385.800," what Awakening is"
3388.500,3391.300," we can't bring a Awakening"
3391.700,3392.200," in"
3392.400,3392.800," like that"
3394.700,3396.200," so that's a first-"
3397.200,3398.100," bedrock"
3398.400,3399.200," aspect of"
3399.800,3401.400," understanding or"
3402.000,3404.000," getting some sense of what this is about"
3404.800,3405.900," it's not something"
3406.700,3408.400," that can be brought into"
3409.300,3410.400," our understanding"
3413.400,3416.000," now I know some of you this won't be a surprise"
3417.700,3419.600," but it's always good to be reminded of it"
3420.800,3421.100," some of you"
3421.900,3423.200," maybe a bit of a surprise"
3424.500,3426.000," surely there's you know"
3426.700,3428.400," there's so many aspects of"
3430.500,3430.900," learning"
3431.500,3434.000," so many ways of learning so many ways of knowing"
3434.400,3434.500," that"
3436.000,3437.600," that can indeed be"
3438.600,3439.000," kind of"
3440.400,3442.800," brought into added to our"
3443.900,3444.600," sort of"
3445.300,3447.600," Arsenal of understanding of Quiver of"
3448.300,3449.700," understanding are the"
3450.000,3450.800," skills and"
3451.800,3453.300," and comprehensions"
3455.200,3456.200," and competencies"
3457.300,3458.100," that we've acquired"
3460.000,3461.300," but actually this one"
3463.000,3463.300," no"
3464.500,3465.200," it can't"
3467.700,3468.700," why can't it"
3471.600,3473.200," get out don't defecate here"
3473.400,3473.800," that's"
3474.700,3475.400," the chance"
3475.800,3479.900," responses which I'm not I'm not saying myself I'm just quoting him okay"
3483.600,3484.400," yeah why not"
3485.300,3489.000," well that's really intense what we need to be looking at because we've got to have some"
3489.900,3490.200," some"
3490.800,3492.400," some hints about what is"
3494.200,3496.300," some hints about what Awakening actually is"
3497.800,3500.300," you know there are many forms of Awakening"
3501.300,3504.000," you know but there's a particular thing here no"
3504.700,3511.400," you know in a week we rightly were commonly you know we'll say we Awakened to a new understanding of a subject"
3512.700,3515.700," you know when it happens all the time there's a great book by"
3516.700,3519.200," William Irvin or called A-ha"
3520.900,3523.500," you know aha exclamation mark A-ha"
3524.100,3527.100," and it's it's about A-Ha moments when"
3527.900,3531.300," we're being working on figuring something out and kind of"
3532.000,3532.100," not"
3532.500,3533.600," not getting anywhere"
3534.400,3535.700," and then just as we're"
3536.500,3538.800," you know pouring the milk into a tea cup"
3540.200,3540.700," boom"
3541.600,3543.300," it comes the answer comes"
3544.000,3545.100," when we're not trying"
3546.300,3548.400," we have been trying and then we stopped trying"
3549.700,3550.500," the answer comes"
3551.500,3554.200," the aha moment comes it we awaken"
3555.000,3557.500," it's like it's like we've been approaching"
3558.400,3560.800," a topic or problem or a puzzle a certain way"
3562.000,3565.800," and then it's it's sort of shows itself to us in the new way"
3566.900,3567.400," and that's"
3567.900,3569.100," how it gets resolved"
3570.100,3572.400," that's a kind of a way we can have"
3573.200,3575.100," moral Awakening"
3576.100,3576.800," we can have"
3578.500,3581.800," many kinds of Awakening we can have psychological Awakening"
3582.600,3586.700," oh my you mean all this time I've been living with x in my system"
3587.400,3589.100," that I particular pattern"
3590.500,3593.800," wow and now I see where that developed and I see that"
3594.500,3597.300," it's done ex in my life and I don't need it anymore"
3598.400,3602.200," how can I now grow through it that's another kind of a way connect"
3603.500,3604.000," but this"
3605.200,3609.900," the kind of Awakening referenced in you know spiritual practice"
3610.800,3611.900," over the millennia"
3613.000,3613.600," is actually"
3614.600,3616.400," even more radical and those"
3617.300,3620.800," because it cuts to the very heart of what we think we are"
3622.100,3624.600," it cuts to the very heart of what we think"
3625.500,3626.800," being alive is"
3628.300,3630.800," it cuts to the heart of experiencing"
3631.700,3632.600," anything at all"
3635.600,3636.200," it's actually"
3637.800,3640.700," a Discovery about the nature of"
3642.900,3643.500," being alive"
3644.700,3645.500," of existing"
3646.500,3646.800," of"
3647.900,3648.900," experiencing"
3651.500,3651.800," and"
3654.500,3658.200," it's it's sort of so is radical and it's kind of"
3659.300,3660.800," you know it's all inclusive"
3662.600,3663.800," because it's all inclusive"
3664.700,3665.700," it's hard to talk about"
3666.900,3668.600," because it includes the words you're saying"
3673.600,3673.600," so"
3678.300,3679.000," so you can't"
3680.100,3681.400," bring it in"
3682.000,3683.300," to your understanding"
3684.600,3685.800," you can't reach for it"
3686.500,3687.400," do some work"
3688.000,3688.500," get it"
3688.800,3689.600," and bring it in"
3691.400,3693.100," because that entire process"
3694.300,3695.100," is already it"
3697.700,3699.000," it's just as if"
3700.500,3700.800," you know"
3701.900,3704.200," as in as in the old adage you know"
3705.400,3706.100," you can't"
3706.600,3707.600," walk to it"
3708.600,3710.300," because every step is it"
3712.000,3714.200," every step of the way is the way"
3718.000,3718.600," every"
3720.500,3721.000," attempt"
3721.900,3722.400," to get"
3723.200,3723.800," Awakening"
3724.300,3725.200," is already"
3726.200,3727.200," what is being sought"
3731.600,3732.200," so"
3733.400,3734.000," coming to"
3735.000,3739.400," factors let's let's nevertheless we've got to consider some factors because"
3740.500,3743.700," there are traditional approaches that are not quite so"
3744.500,3745.300," I'm steap"
3745.700,3748.700," as that that's almost putting it like a cliff you know you either"
3749.700,3752.500," you either step off the cliff or you don't"
3753.100,3754.700," but actually they're there are"
3755.700,3756.300," traditional"
3756.700,3757.900," notions of"
3758.700,3759.800," approaches or"
3761.800,3765.700," yeah factors methods and factors and conditions"
3766.200,3767.100," that can be set up"
3767.700,3768.200," the help"
3769.000,3769.200," and"
3770.400,3774.200," I want to in this course I want to I want to introduce them"
3775.200,3776.000," and the most"
3777.000,3777.300," the most"
3778.800,3780.400," kind of best known really"
3781.200,3782.900," is the seven factors of Awakening"
3783.500,3785.500," in terava Buddhism it's a"
3786.200,3788.100," it's a it's a teaching in the party Canon"
3788.900,3790.300," it comes quite early"
3791.000,3792.100," on I think in Buddhism"
3793.000,3793.200," that"
3793.600,3796.900," there is a sequence of steps you can take now I must say when I first"
3797.400,3798.800," discovered this heard about this"
3799.400,3801.000," after some years of"
3801.700,3805.000," of doing um mantra practice and then doing Zen"
3805.500,3806.400," hoan practice"
3807.200,3807.700," I was kind of"
3809.100,3811.000," I was kind of a bit surprised wow"
3811.700,3812.500," you mean there's a"
3813.400,3815.200," there is a kind of Engineering"
3815.900,3818.600," that can be done to bring it about because"
3819.300,3820.600," you know I had a"
3821.100,3821.400," some"
3822.100,3826.000," I'd say some moments of Awakening which is often how it starts"
3826.700,3828.400," moments sudden moments"
3828.900,3829.500," sudden"
3829.700,3830.600," recognitions"
3831.200,3833.100," that there's a different order of things"
3834.000,3834.700," and that"
3835.300,3837.000," the construction of the world"
3838.800,3840.800," that I've been making that we've been making"
3842.000,3845.200," where you know we're in here and it's out there that's all wrong"
3846.000,3849.800," and the construction of the world where there's time ticking along on a linear thread"
3850.300,3851.000," that's all wrong"
3851.700,3852.000," and there's"
3852.800,3854.000," there's a space where"
3854.700,3857.800," there's near and there's far and that's all wrong you know"
3858.400,3859.200," these things can"
3860.000,3861.200," suddenly hit us"
3862.100,3862.700," but but"
3863.200,3864.200," as far as I could tell"
3865.000,3866.400," there was no order by which"
3867.400,3869.300," they came they just came when they came"
3870.100,3870.600," you know and"
3872.400,3876.500," and that didn't seem in my life to that point they're just seemed to be"
3878.800,3880.400," a whole lot one could do about it"
3882.800,3885.400," and it's been a slow process for me if realising"
3886.000,3886.600," actually yeah"
3887.100,3888.100," you know there are things"
3889.000,3890.700," that are really helpful to be doing"
3891.700,3894.600," even if you can't actually trigger moments like that"
3895.400,3898.000," you can do things that will mean they're more likely to come"
3898.700,3901.800," and you can do things that mean if they do come"
3902.500,3904.100," they will have a better chance"
3904.600,3906.600," of actually infusing"
3907.200,3907.800," your life"
3909.100,3909.700," henceforth"
3911.000,3912.400," they'll have a better chance"
3913.100,3913.200," of"
3914.000,3914.700," integrating"
3915.400,3916.200," into your life"
3916.700,3918.200," you'll have a better chance"
3918.800,3920.100," of being able to live"
3921.100,3921.500," out of"
3922.100,3922.300," what"
3923.000,3923.500," you've discovered"
3924.300,3925.600," in in the deeper"
3926.800,3929.700," of those rare Brand and spontaneous moments"
3930.300,3931.600," in the deepest of them"
3932.100,3932.900," you might find"
3933.900,3934.300," something"
3935.900,3936.900," that isn't a thing"
3937.900,3939.100," that henceforth"
3940.100,3940.800," you can live"
3942.700,3944.000," as you can live"
3944.700,3945.000," from"
3946.000,3947.100," you can live Force"
3947.500,3947.800," from"
3948.000,3948.300," it"
3949.000,3949.600," you're not really"
3950.900,3953.700," doing that in quite the way that you've done other kinds of living"
3954.400,3955.400," but somehow it can become"
3956.100,3956.900," a source"
3958.700,3960.500," I mean es o u"
3960.900,3961.600," r c e"
3962.700,3964.600," a source from which you live"
3965.800,3970.900," yeah may also be a little bit of a source on your life as well because it makes it all tastes so good"
3971.700,3973.100," just any normal moment"
3973.900,3975.700," has a sublime taste"
3976.500,3977.100," thereafter"
3977.900,3979.100," and they may come and go"
3979.300,3979.800," but you know"
3982.300,3982.600," so"
3983.600,3988.200," in the old early Buddhist formulation there are 7 things you can do"
3989.300,3990.700," you can develop mindfulness"
3993.800,3995.200," in your mindful practice"
3996.500,3999.400," in your in the context of his developing a mindfulness"
4000.400,4001.900," you can also develop"
4002.800,4003.700," curiosity"
4005.000,4006.800," I can investigative"
4007.800,4008.400," attitude"
4009.700,4010.100," that's the"
4010.600,4012.500," first in the second or these factors"
4014.000,4014.800," the third one"
4015.100,4018.700," is because you're getting curious-- about the way things work"
4019.800,4020.600," you get more energy"
4021.000,4021.700," in your practice"
4023.200,4024.100," so then you've got mindfulness"
4024.800,4025.500," curiosity"
4026.000,4028.200," energy Drive determination you know"
4028.900,4030.200," energy for the practice"
4031.100,4033.100," and those things can lead to"
4034.000,4035.500," experiences of"
4036.400,4037.000," delight"
4039.400,4040.000," delight"
4041.500,4042.100," a kind of"
4043.200,4044.700," seems like I said I almost"
4045.700,4046.500," unposed"
4047.900,4048.500," pleasure"
4048.700,4049.400," deep pleasure"
4050.200,4051.800," uncaused in there is not"
4052.700,4056.100," actually coming from the gratification of any sense"
4057.200,4058.400," particular sense it's"
4058.800,4061.300," it's more like a deep pleasure in being"
4062.900,4064.700," there's a very beautiful thing this"
4065.400,4066.000," it's um"
4067.200,4068.400," you know it's it's a"
4070.000,4079.900," it it this little scheme of the seven factors well I don't know if it's little this scheme of the seven factors of Awakening overlaps with Janna practice somewhat where"
4080.700,4082.900," bitty or Rapture or delight"
4083.200,4083.800," Glee"
4084.200,4086.600," is part of the process in janitor training but"
4087.200,4088.000," let's leave that aside"
4089.300,4091.200," so the fourth Factor then is"
4091.800,4092.400," delight"
4093.300,4094.300," just share"
4095.900,4096.100," deep"
4097.300,4097.400," and"
4098.000,4099.600," wholesome I want to say"
4100.200,4101.100," cleansing"
4102.000,4102.500," Leisure"
4103.400,4103.700," in"
4104.800,4105.100," being"
4106.100,4107.200," is Finding"
4108.000,4111.000," and artists ravishing sweetness"
4111.900,4112.900," in just being"
4114.200,4116.900," and I bet many of you have known"
4117.600,4119.800," moments like this in meditation"
4120.600,4121.300," that came"
4123.000,4125.000," like so much of this stuff came"
4125.500,4126.700," seemingly out of nowhere"
4128.400,4129.900," and then maybe he thought"
4130.800,4131.900," wow this is amazing"
4132.900,4133.900," and I don't want this to stop"
4134.300,4135.400," and then it stopped you know"
4136.100,4140.800," all you get back on the seat I want that thing that happened last Wednesday I wanted again now"
4141.600,4142.800," and you don't know how to bring it on"
4143.200,4146.200," well actually if you follow these little steps it might work"
4147.000,4148.200," because you're not seeking it you're just"
4149.800,4150.500," doing your mindfulness"
4151.700,4152.400," being curious"
4154.500,4157.500," binding a certain kind of energy for practice coming up"
4158.400,4158.700," and then"
4160.300,4161.300," am I switch on again"
4162.100,4163.200," deep wholesome"
4165.100,4165.800," delight"
4167.300,4167.900," in just being"
4170.200,4171.900," that's the fourth one and then the fifth one"
4173.600,4174.600," the fifth one is"
4176.600,4177.100," calm"
4179.800,4180.900," a beautiful calm"
4183.800,4184.500," I would imagine"
4186.100,4188.200," a number of you have tasted that as well"
4189.600,4190.500," on your seat"
4192.400,4193.400," when a calm"
4193.700,4194.300," comes"
4196.600,4197.700," it's like a different"
4198.500,4200.900," a little bit of a different order of calm"
4201.900,4202.100," from"
4202.600,4203.000," just being"
4207.000,4208.400," that's your own calm"
4208.900,4209.400," that you can"
4210.400,4212.400," you can turn on you can develop"
4213.300,4216.000," you can find ways of getting to you can make yourself"
4217.700,4218.300," calm"
4218.600,4219.500," you know you can just"
4220.500,4221.700," take 3D breaths"
4222.700,4223.800," and be a bit calmer"
4225.300,4225.700," you know where"
4226.500,4226.600," we're"
4228.400,4230.400," moving one of the levers on the"
4231.600,4233.200," parasympathetic nervous system"
4235.600,4236.400," increasing it"
4237.300,4238.600," dining down the sympathetic"
4240.600,4242.900," giving a boost to the parasympathetic"
4244.100,4245.300," and finding some calm"
4247.600,4249.300," and also you may have tasted"
4250.400,4252.100," a deeper kind of Kal"
4252.500,4253.900," the seems to come to us"
4255.400,4258.100," or we it's almost like we seem to discover it"
4258.900,4261.100," as if there's a wider calm"
4262.200,4263.400," waiting to be found"
4264.500,4265.800," and we sometimes just"
4268.800,4269.300," find it"
4270.300,4270.500," all"
4271.200,4272.200," better perhaps"
4273.100,4273.300," it"
4273.600,4274.100," binds"
4274.600,4274.900," us"
4278.100,4279.300," and we don't have to do anything"
4281.500,4282.300," we've done the doing"
4284.000,4284.200," you know"
4286.000,4289.200," the mindful breathing or whatever it was we've done our part"
4290.700,4291.300," and found"
4292.900,4293.500," a more"
4293.900,4295.100," quiet relaxed"
4295.400,4295.800," state"
4296.700,4297.000," and then"
4297.800,4298.900," their little shift comes"
4299.700,4300.400," where we don't do"
4301.900,4303.100," we Nan"
4303.400,4303.700," do"
4304.500,4305.500," and a deeper"
4306.100,4306.500," wider"
4306.900,4307.500," larger"
4308.100,4308.500," calm"
4309.800,4310.300," cont"
4313.600,4314.500," okay and then"
4315.600,4317.600," that's the fifth and then the sixth Factor"
4318.700,4319.800," is samadhi"
4320.900,4322.000," samadhi meaning"
4323.300,4323.900," absorption"
4326.500,4327.000," we become"
4328.900,4332.000," one sort of integrated field of awareness"
4333.200,4335.900," because it's sometimes translated concentration but"
4337.600,4338.200," we don't really"
4339.800,4345.500," we don't really use the word in that sense in English language we buy concentration we mean focus"
4346.300,4347.000," you know con"
4348.000,4349.600," would putting all our attention on something"
4350.700,4352.000," and this is more like a"
4352.400,4354.600," whole a wholeness of attention"
4355.600,4357.700," a whole effortless attentiveness"
4358.200,4360.000," that unifies our experience"
4361.500,4362.200," so it's very"
4363.800,4366.000," peaceful & very energized"
4366.500,4367.600," and very alert"
4368.400,4369.200," and quiet"
4370.700,4371.000," and"
4372.200,4373.000," cohesive"
4373.600,4375.600," integrated beautiful state"
4375.900,4377.100," it has different flavours"
4377.700,4378.500," we won't go into that"
4379.000,4379.300," now"
4380.200,4383.900," but that's the sixth factor of Awakening and there was the seventh Factor"
4384.400,4385.100," is equanimity"
4386.500,4387.800," really unmoved"
4389.000,4390.400," by pleasure and pain"
4391.200,4391.400," you know"
4392.300,4393.900," things we want things we don't want"
4394.900,4395.400," the push"
4396.100,4397.400," pushing away has stopped"
4398.000,4399.400," pulling the wanting to get"
4399.800,4400.500," has stopped"
4401.600,4402.900," we don't mind so much"
4404.800,4405.500," what happens"
4408.900,4415.100," and again it's it's almost like it's got two sides one side would be"
4417.000,4419.700," where kind of training ourselves to"
4420.600,4421.800," be more open"
4422.700,4423.400," more allowing"
4424.100,4425.700," letting what comes up come up"
4426.500,4430.000," and that's great we develop that we can develop that"
4430.400,4432.000," we can get better at finding"
4432.800,4434.500," our own capacity to allow"
4435.600,4436.500," to let things be"
4437.100,4437.600," as they are"
4438.600,4440.000," to arise as their rise"
4440.600,4442.000," to the part as they depart"
4442.900,4443.300," so we're not"
4444.300,4446.300," scrambling after stuff that we don't want to"
4446.600,4447.400," have go away"
4448.300,4450.600," we're not grasping after things that we want to get"
4451.900,4454.000," and it all manner of terrains by the way"
4454.500,4455.400," territories of life"
4456.300,4457.300," we're letting things be"
4458.600,4461.600," and then there's the equanimity that seems to"
4463.000,4465.100," sometimes just flow in"
4468.100,4469.700," a great okayness"
4471.100,4471.800," this is this"
4473.100,4473.700," this is it"
4474.600,4475.800," this is how it is"
4477.400,4480.500," we sort of again make a kind of little Discovery"
4482.700,4483.200," of"
4483.900,4486.100," this is just like"
4486.800,4487.000," this"
4489.100,4489.200," this"
4491.100,4491.900," is what's happening"
4493.300,4494.100," this is"
4495.900,4496.200," okay"
4497.900,4498.100," this"
4501.700,4504.000," you know we sometimes just stumble into that"
4505.900,4509.300," so there's the again there's sort of Two Sides there's that equanimity that"
4509.900,4511.700," we can help to develop"
4512.100,4512.800," in ourselves"
4514.000,4516.000," and then there's a wider sense of"
4517.600,4518.600," this is how it is"
4520.000,4521.300," and we taste it"
4521.800,4522.200," this"
4522.900,4523.500," is exactly"
4524.400,4524.700," this"
4526.600,4530.800," and there's just no way it can wish to be otherwise you know"
4531.300,4531.900," it's just is"
4532.500,4533.700," is actually perfect"
4534.400,4535.100," just like this"
4535.800,4537.600," I know that's a scary word perfect but"
4538.100,4538.100," you know"
4539.500,4539.900," it's sort of"
4540.500,4541.000," invites"
4541.500,4543.900," things that we don't really want in practice like"
4544.400,4545.500," well perfectionism"
4546.500,4547.600," but it's actually the opposite"
4548.400,4551.700," perfectionism is finding that just like this is"
4552.900,4553.300," it"
4553.600,4554.500," is perfect"
4555.200,4559.800," it's utterly imperfect and they're all the ways that we might normally think it is"
4560.400,4561.200," and it's"
4561.600,4561.900," perfect"
4563.000,4564.900," because this is it"
4566.100,4567.000," this is it"
4568.400,4568.700," this"
4570.600,4571.500," so again it's a sort of"
4573.600,4574.500," more than us"
4576.500,4577.300," academically"
4577.800,4578.600," not our own"
4579.000,4579.300," really"
4580.200,4581.100," understood to us"
4582.800,4583.600," we do our"
4584.500,4584.800," part China"
4585.300,4588.100," get them we make we get that all version"
4588.800,4590.000," and then this bigger version"
4591.100,4591.900," they show itself"
4592.500,4594.500," which we don't do we don't generate"
4596.500,4599.600," um so those are the seven factors of Awakening boom"
4600.400,4600.600," well"
4601.100,4602.500," what about Awakening"
4607.100,4608.000," what about Awakening"
4612.400,4612.600," yeah"
4613.200,4615.000," alright well it's a tricky business you see"
4615.500,4616.600," because you can't"
4617.200,4621.100," if you think you can get it if you think you can understand it or you think you can get it"
4621.500,4622.600," off on the wrong track"
4628.800,4630.100," on the wrong track"
4631.000,4631.300," yeah"
4633.600,4633.600," yeah"
4637.800,4639.500," so what are we going to do about that"
4646.500,4647.600," what are we going to do about that"
4648.800,4649.400," well you know"
4650.100,4651.000," actually nobody knows"
4652.100,4653.200," I don't think anybody knows"
4656.600,4656.900," I think"
4659.600,4661.500," I think this might be a moment when we've got to actually"
4661.900,4663.700," just drill down a little bit into"
4664.400,4666.500," what Awakening might actually be"
4667.000,4668.600," regardless of how we might get it"
4669.100,4670.100," what actually is it"
4677.500,4677.700," well"
4679.800,4682.600," there's there's actually different views on this"
4684.500,4686.000," and I might just"
4687.500,4689.100," suggest a few and then"
4690.900,4692.200," see if there's a"
4692.500,4693.900," some sort of common ground"
4694.300,4694.800," that we"
4695.800,4697.300," we might all land on"
4698.200,4703.500," and and then into a certain extent decide what we mean by"
4704.600,4707.400," it and with certainly we can look at what the traditions"
4708.600,4710.400," that have really gone into it well they"
4711.400,4713.800," mean by it and is their common ground among them"
4714.800,4715.900," there was a guy"
4716.500,4720.900," whose name I can't remember who was a body worker in California I think L.A"
4721.400,4722.500," in the 70s and 80s"
4724.500,4728.000," I kind of liked his his his work actually it was a little bit"
4729.300,4733.300," you know it was somatic work really and it was a bit a bit of"
4734.200,4735.700," felden christ-like"
4736.500,4737.700," but not really it was"
4738.600,4738.900," maybe"
4742.700,4744.800," I'm just forgotten his name Thomas"
4746.500,4748.100," what's he called Thomas"
4748.700,4749.500," hatto Thomas"
4750.500,4751.300," maybe some of you know"
4752.100,4752.300," Thomas"
4753.100,4754.300," hatto what was his name"
4754.800,4755.800," he was a body"
4756.500,4758.100," that body worker Guy"
4758.600,4760.200," anyway sorry sorry for my"
4762.400,4764.800," breakfast for my my forgetful mind"
4765.600,4766.600," anyway this guy"
4767.400,4768.100," he said"
4768.900,4770.700," I'll tell you what in life and is"
4771.800,4772.500," it's when"
4773.300,4774.000," there is no"
4774.900,4775.700," unnecessary"
4776.500,4777.600," muscular tension"
4778.200,4778.700," in the body"
4779.500,4779.900," anyway"
4783.000,4784.300," that's what enlightenment is"
4785.600,4791.700," I must and when I first heard that I just got you know I was this was probably 15 20 years ago now"
4792.100,4793.000," I knew much better"
4793.800,4794.400," rubbish"
4794.800,4795.800," rubbish yeah"
4797.700,4799.800," enlightenment is is"
4801.000,4801.200," it"
4801.600,4803.000," total collapse of"
4804.100,4808.100," self and others a collapse of the Cosmos is discovering there's absolutely"
4809.100,4811.500," only one nothing doing everything you know"
4812.100,4812.800," whatever you know"
4813.400,4815.500," I have that's sure from you know"
4816.100,4818.700," deep different training's especially then that had been through"
4819.700,4820.600," that was nonsense"
4821.300,4824.300," no unnecessary muscular tension in the body"
4825.500,4825.700," what"
4826.300,4826.800," that's just"
4827.300,4828.500," being relaxed or something"
4829.400,4831.600," but actually over time I've come to"
4832.500,4834.100," I've come to appreciate that"
4835.000,4835.400," more"
4837.400,4839.400," maybe he's maybe he's right because"
4840.700,4841.400," oh wow"
4842.700,4844.400," do you have any you know sense of"
4845.000,4845.700," what it's like"
4846.400,4847.000," to find"
4848.000,4848.300," that"
4849.600,4851.200," you know you've never moved in inch"
4852.300,4852.500," but"
4853.100,4854.000," everything's been"
4855.400,4857.100," just as it needed to be"
4858.400,4859.100," all along"
4861.100,4862.700," that there's a level of"
4864.100,4865.300," existence where"
4867.300,4868.100," just nothing"
4869.800,4871.600," but it's it's just"
4872.200,4873.800," this it's just this"
4874.600,4875.800," is just perfect"
4876.800,4877.300," just this"
4878.200,4878.400," and"
4879.200,4880.500," all our efforts"
4881.900,4882.400," have been"
4884.500,4886.300," in a way totally misguided"
4886.800,4887.700," even our efforts"
4888.500,4889.200," to find"
4890.300,4894.400," the Deep well-being well-being that practice promises even they have been"
4895.100,4895.800," misguided"
4896.800,4897.100," because"
4900.200,4901.500," the effort to find it"
4902.300,4902.800," hit"
4906.200,4908.200," it it was always right here"
4910.100,4910.500," this sort of"
4911.100,4913.200," really kind of Ultimate treasure"
4914.300,4915.100," Waze always"
4915.800,4916.400," right here"
4917.900,4918.700," and it has"
4920.400,4921.200," no effort"
4922.300,4923.000," in any way"
4924.800,4925.900," it's utterly"
4926.600,4927.000," without"
4928.000,4928.400," effort"
4930.800,4931.000," and"
4931.600,4931.900," boom"
4932.800,4934.000," it's really like"
4934.600,4935.000," dropping"
4936.200,4936.500," into"
4938.300,4939.300," the ultimate home"
4942.200,4943.500," there had been here all along"
4945.200,4947.200," and I was just bouncing around"
4947.900,4948.500," not seeing"
4950.100,4951.900," trying to find here trying to find there"
4952.400,4954.100," doing all kinds of other things that weren't"
4955.500,4956.800," involved in trying to find it"
4957.400,4961.300," except that perhaps they secretly were I just didn't realise it"
4962.500,4964.100," because I was always one more or another trying to be"
4965.500,4967.200," happier and less unhappy"
4967.900,4968.700," you know somehow"
4969.400,4970.200," that was in there"
4971.600,4972.800," trying to do what I could"
4974.300,4976.700," support and help the lives of those around me"
4977.900,4978.700," and all along"
4979.600,4980.300," I didn't know"
4983.000,4983.500," that the"
4984.900,4986.400," the fundamental support"
4987.600,4988.500," the fundamental"
4990.000,4990.800," reality"
4991.800,4993.300," that we were all in"
4995.300,4995.800," we're all"
4996.800,4997.200," part of"
4998.400,4999.900," and in fact all were"
5000.900,5002.100," was just sitting here"
5003.300,5003.800," patiently"
5004.500,5005.000," Waiting"
5007.600,5008.900," while I bounced her out"
5011.300,5011.700," and when"
5014.700,5015.400," somehow"
5018.200,5019.200," I stopped bouncing around"
5020.800,5021.400," just as long enough"
5022.300,5022.500," boom"
5023.100,5024.700," to drop through the floor"
5026.200,5026.600," here it is"
5028.700,5029.200," here it is"
5031.600,5032.000," effortless"
5034.500,5035.700," utterly effortless"
5039.400,5039.900," and maybe"
5041.100,5041.500," actually"
5042.900,5043.100," not"
5044.800,5045.400," one"
5045.900,5046.800," microscopic"
5048.100,5049.800," unnecessary muscular"
5050.100,5051.300," tension anywhere"
5053.900,5054.900," maybe that's right on"
5055.100,5055.200," you know"
5056.200,5056.600," who knows"
5059.100,5059.200," but"
5059.900,5061.200," okay Leaving that aside"
5061.700,5062.100," and I'll be"
5062.500,5063.200," pulling soon"
5067.500,5068.500," what it's"
5069.200,5071.800," you know what we might usually say about it"
5072.300,5073.600," what it is"
5074.700,5074.900," is"
5077.300,5077.700," it's all"
5078.300,5078.900," yeah it's all"
5079.500,5082.600," it's all to do with this sense of me at the middle"
5083.600,5083.800," but"
5085.200,5088.200," I am the agent the operator the recipient"
5089.400,5092.100," and the driver and the Seeker"
5095.800,5096.100," and"
5097.200,5099.200," what happens if we"
5100.300,5101.000," see through"
5103.300,5103.600," that"
5104.500,5105.700," sense of who I am"
5106.100,5106.800," in other words"
5107.700,5108.300," Awakening"
5110.000,5111.700," teams to be a radical shift"
5112.800,5113.800," a radical Discovery"
5114.400,5115.100," about who"
5115.700,5116.200," and what"
5116.700,5117.600," we really are"
5119.400,5120.900," and one of the most succinct"
5121.200,5122.500," ways of putting it"
5123.100,5123.600," is what"
5124.600,5126.500," SRI nisargadatta said"
5127.200,5128.300," I am"
5129.000,5129.300," that"
5131.800,5132.600," any that"
5133.100,5133.900," any object"
5135.900,5136.100," that"
5136.800,5138.900," I thought I was not because it wasn't me"
5140.500,5140.900," I am"
5141.500,5141.700," that"
5143.500,5144.200," I am that"
5147.600,5148.300," so that's a"
5149.600,5152.500," very succinct way of expressing"
5153.900,5154.700," something really"
5156.600,5157.100," kind of"
5158.400,5160.400," mind blowing the comprehensive"
5161.600,5162.400," I am that"
5163.000,5165.200," you can't say I am that"
5166.100,5167.200," without a total"
5168.500,5170.000," collapse of the ordinary way"
5170.600,5171.800," of understanding the world"
5172.000,5172.900," does that make sense like"
5173.300,5174.700," the order of understanding the world"
5175.200,5175.600," is that"
5176.300,5176.400," you know"
5177.700,5179.700," everything around me is around me"
5180.600,5181.200," but not me"
5183.000,5186.000," whether it's the coffee cup there is a book where there's computer"
5186.400,5187.700," wall tree"
5189.000,5190.700," Cosmo's is around me"
5191.600,5192.300," and not me"
5193.200,5194.500," and this agadas said"
5194.800,5195.300," I am"
5195.900,5196.100," that"
5197.200,5198.500," whatever I think is not me"
5199.600,5200.200," that's what I am"
5201.900,5202.500," so that is"
5204.400,5205.200," it's not some"
5207.400,5208.000," cognitive"
5209.100,5209.500," manipulation"
5210.200,5210.900," it's not some"
5212.100,5213.000," distortion of"
5213.500,5214.800," ordinary logic it's not"
5215.300,5216.200," it's not a"
5223.600,5224.600," it's not a particular"
5229.400,5230.600," yeah manipulation"
5232.300,5234.000," not at all it's a dropping"
5234.800,5236.100," of the basic"
5237.300,5239.900," construction of reality that we've all been making"
5240.900,5244.600," it's finding that our basic construction of reality has been"
5247.800,5249.600," as being one particular"
5250.500,5250.900," model"
5252.500,5254.900," has been a conceptual model basically"
5256.300,5256.500," and"
5257.900,5258.900,"a mind-blowing"
5259.600,5260.700," it can fall away"
5261.500,5262.500," it can be seen through"
5263.300,5265.000," it can drop Away it can"
5265.600,5265.900," it can"
5267.900,5271.100," we can suddenly no longer be making that conceptual model"
5272.700,5274.500," and then we find that there's just"
5275.300,5275.600," one"
5276.600,5277.300," unfolding"
5278.100,5279.200," and in fact it shows up in"
5279.800,5281.700," it can show up in a number of different ways"
5283.000,5285.900," which we can start looking at in subsequent sessions"
5286.800,5290.300," but that's that's the heart of it really I am that"
5291.500,5293.100," and what does that actually mean"
5294.200,5295.100," I am that"
5296.800,5297.600," and if we just"
5300.300,5302.200," hark back to today's champs"
5302.800,5304.600," when he was asked what is Awakening"
5305.600,5306.600," and he said get out"
5307.800,5308.700," don't defecate here"
5311.700,5312.900," c can you see that"
5313.500,5315.800," if the conceptual model has already gone"
5316.700,5319.000," why wouldn't that be a perfect way of sampler showing it"
5320.300,5322.800," why wouldn't it be perfect to say stop looking for it"
5323.800,5324.000," you know"
5324.900,5326.500," don't come here with your searching"
5327.800,5328.500," you're searching"
5328.900,5330.100," isn't going to help"
5331.600,5332.300," they can't"
5333.400,5336.100," because as long as you're searching you think it's another thing"
5336.600,5339.400," that you can fit into your conceptual model of me and"
5339.500,5340.700," me here world out there"
5341.100,5343.000," at just another thing I got to find out there"
5343.800,5344.300," is it"
5344.600,5346.100," you're not recognising"
5346.500,5348.200," that it is the whole model itself"
5349.500,5351.500," it's just discovering that you've been"
5352.000,5352.900," making a model"
5353.400,5354.800," of how things work and believing it"
5359.400,5360.600," okay so I think I'm going to"
5362.000,5365.200," pause there because this is a this is actually a never-ending topic"
5366.200,5367.400," it's a never-ending topic"
5368.000,5368.400," literally"
5369.000,5369.600," never ending"
5370.600,5373.000," I mean I think it'll go on long past"
5373.700,5375.400," Earth has been swallowed by the sun"
5376.000,5378.100," you know Earth being swallowed by the sun is part of the"
5378.500,5379.200," as part of the same"
5380.400,5384.600," it's sort of the same as talk as saying get out deja and say get out"
5385.000,5386.200," is actually the same as the"
5386.900,5390.200," the red giant or whatever it is engulfing the earth you know in"
5390.600,5391.700," three billion years would have"
5392.100,5394.000," it's all part of the same process"
5396.000,5397.200," and so are we"
5398.100,5401.800," so is this dialogue or that's just not much with dialogue sorry monologue"
5402.700,5403.800," let's think going on"
5404.000,5404.500," the last"
5405.100,5406.000," 30 40 minutes"
5406.300,5409.100," so I'm going to interrupt it now hit pause boom let's"
5409.500,5412.000," hear any responses any questions any"
5413.700,5414.600," any reflections"
5415.500,5417.200," that we can bring in to"
5418.100,5419.900," the mix as we all Explorer"
5420.900,5423.200," factors of Awakening in the doing and the undoing"
5424.100,5426.200," and how do we what do we do"
5432.700,5438.100," hey I'm just looking at the thing Marilyn ivy thanks for that lovely quote from Charlotte joker better that's beautiful"
5438.500,5439.500," I love that book by the way"
5442.500,5445.100," Mary Frances thanks effort to find it hides it"
5445.800,5449.400," into dependence independence is beautiful part of the whole picture"
5450.000,5452.700," Thomas Hannah thank you that's exactly what's to try to"
5453.400,5459.100," support I don't know what that was a little bit of a reference to I'm sorry I forget"
5459.900,5461.900," okay in perfect zoom settings"
5463.000,5467.200," yep I've had cases of one to five perhaps great great great great great great great okay"
5468.200,5471.400," but there's this voice self that measures and compares"
5472.000,5473.300," not there and just this"
5474.300,5476.100," at the same time yes exactly see"
5476.600,5480.500," so so I'm going to take this as a as a useful comment for all of us here"
5483.700,5484.500," not there"
5485.500,5491.800," and just the just this at the same time let me just unpack that Julie forgive me first speaking on your behalf but"
5492.400,5493.400," I think Julie is saying"
5494.400,5494.600," she's"
5495.100,5497.000," she's had tastes of"
5497.500,5499.400," the first five factors of Awakening"
5500.200,5503.700," and measures and Compares and then there's a voice in her saying"
5504.400,5505.100," you're not there"
5506.600,5508.600," but even that voice"
5509.200,5509.400," is"
5509.900,5510.200," it"
5512.500,5515.300," and also maybe I haven't got that quite right"
5515.900,5516.300," when"
5517.500,5522.000," when in one of those factors of waking let's say like the Deep calm"
5523.100,5523.400," saying"
5523.900,5525.000," comparing and"
5525.600,5526.800," and and and and measuring"
5528.100,5529.800," but at the same time there's a sense that"
5530.500,5531.700," they're really is just this"
5538.100,5538.400," and"
5542.300,5543.400," you know the reason why"
5544.300,5547.800," I might as well just slit this in here the reason why these factors of Awakening"
5549.000,5550.300," are great and also"
5551.200,5554.300," in a sense musk sort of fall down sort of"
5555.500,5557.600," is exactly what I was saying but you know the"
5558.100,5559.700," every step of the way is the way"
5560.900,5563.000," each step each Factor"
5564.100,5566.200," of Awakening is entirely"
5567.200,5567.900," Awakening"
5568.900,5569.300," already"
5573.000,5574.000," they can't not be"
5575.900,5577.500," when they in zen their talk about"
5578.500,5579.900," even delusion"
5580.300,5581.400," is Awakening"
5583.800,5585.900," you know the Guardian I said something like that"
5587.200,5589.500," the world of suffering and delusion"
5590.700,5591.100," is"
5592.300,5593.000," The Awakening"
5595.700,5597.300," it's just a shift"
5599.000,5600.200," in the angle of light"
5602.400,5603.300," and we see what it is"
5611.000,5612.500," this is the song that never ends"
5613.400,5616.100," it just goes on and on my friend some people started singing it"
5617.200,5620.200," not knowing what it was and we'll continue seeing it forever"
5620.500,5623.100," just because this is the song that never ends"
5624.200,5626.600," yes actually you know it's quite interesting there's a"
5627.000,5628.000," there's a book buy"
5629.200,5629.500," the Great"
5630.900,5631.900," hacker in"
5632.400,5635.700," so not a booker an essay he was a 18th century"
5636.200,5638.000," brilliant 18th centuries and master"
5638.700,5640.900," he was a very determined seeker actually"
5641.600,5643.500," and but then of eventually got to"
5644.100,5647.100," really deeper Awakening where he said it was like um"
5647.800,5650.000," he felt like he was a sack of beans"
5650.800,5651.900," that had been split over"
5653.000,5653.600," in the hole"
5654.100,5655.300," sack just sacked"
5655.900,5658.200," that was his Awakened his deepest Awakening"
5658.600,5661.900," he was studying the Lotus suits were very assiduously"
5662.600,5665.900," and one night and sitting meditating a lot studying and Lotus soup"
5666.500,5667.100," meditating"
5667.600,5670.100," suture meditating Sutra meditating"
5670.700,5671.400," and one night"
5673.200,5676.400," deep in the night lots and lots of meditation deep in the night"
5677.000,5678.600," he heard a cricket start singing"
5680.200,5680.700," and he said"
5681.300,5682.500," he he just"
5684.900,5686.400," he melted into tears"
5687.400,5689.200," and felt like a sack of beans"
5690.100,5691.100," that have been cut open"
5694.900,5696.400," just that cricket singing"
5697.500,5698.800," taught him way more"
5700.000,5701.200," than decades of"
5701.600,5702.000," boring"
5702.600,5702.700," through"
5703.300,5705.100," an over the Lotus Sutra"
5707.100,5710.400," so anybody you know biome is put up a hand if anybody wants to"
5712.200,5713.400," ask anything"
5714.200,5715.800," you know with voice"
5716.700,5722.100," mazumi Roch she said in light as the falling web any distinction between enlightenment and non enlightenment"
5722.600,5724.000," yes that's a good one too"
5728.300,5731.300," I think that's that's the that's that's in line with"
5733.000,5735.300," this what I was just saying actually about"
5736.300,5736.400," the"
5737.500,5740.600," identity the oneness of Awakening"
5741.500,5741.700," and"
5742.400,5743.100," delusion"
5747.000,5749.400," yeah they they say also in zen that"
5753.300,5756.700," I didn't know something like Awakening is not complete"
5757.300,5759.100," until you've washed it away completely"
5760.000,5761.900," and you can't remember anything about it"
5765.100,5767.100," yes Sean please"
5768.300,5768.800," go ahead"
5769.300,5770.000," let's um"
5772.600,5774.200," can we unmute Sean"
5775.200,5775.500," yeah"
5776.200,5776.400," hey"
5778.100,5778.800," hi I am"
5779.500,5779.800," I hi"
5780.500,5781.000," thanks for that"
5781.800,5782.100," bark"
5782.500,5783.500," sit"
5784.300,5789.000," I was wondering if nuanced is other nuances to just this"
5789.700,5789.900," there"
5791.600,5791.700," what"
5792.200,5794.200," how might you I'm look at"
5794.600,5797.200," nuances our nuanced itself"
5798.500,5800.100," sometimes I feel like I'm a nuance"
5805.200,5806.800," we're all nuances I love that"
5807.500,5810.600," hey Sean did he say other nuances to just this"
5811.300,5811.700," yeah you"
5813.600,5813.700," yeah yes"
5815.400,5819.300," yeah I mean on the level of just this as a phrase"
5820.600,5822.900," I think there are actually I think there's"
5823.900,5824.200," see"
5826.600,5828.300," first of all there's a general nuance"
5829.000,5829.500," whether"
5830.300,5832.500," something we say is a kind of"
5833.000,5835.000," piece of practice guidance"
5835.700,5836.600," or whether it's a"
5837.100,5837.800," presentation"
5839.100,5839.800," of reality"
5840.900,5840.900," so"
5841.500,5844.200," sometimes just this is said bye"
5845.800,5850.400," by the way folks is a common zen instruction just just this is common in the Zen"
5851.500,5856.700," the Zen world the Zen annals often contain this teaching adjust this just this"
5857.400,5858.800," and it can mean like"
5861.200,5863.300," just pay attention to what is"
5863.700,5864.300," arising"
5865.800,5870.000," it can also mean so then it's a sort of instruction and then it can mean things like"
5870.900,5874.000," you know when you're eating just"
5874.800,5875.100," eat"
5876.300,5877.100," when you're walking"
5878.000,5878.300," just"
5879.100,5879.500," walk"
5880.500,5881.800," there can be a very useful"
5883.700,5884.000," quick"
5885.000,5886.900," practice reminder through the day"
5887.600,5888.200," just this"
5888.700,5889.600," it's actually okay-"
5890.400,5891.000," you know because we get"
5891.500,5892.100," hooked on our"
5893.400,5894.000," on our"
5896.000,5897.300," confabulations about"
5897.900,5902.400," the future and the past is easy to get hooked on in a must be thinking about our meeting you know"
5903.200,5905.700," and then and then just this as no"
5906.200,5906.800," it's okay"
5907.500,5908.100," to just"
5908.700,5908.900," be"
5909.500,5909.900," present"
5910.200,5910.500," here"
5911.500,5911.600," now"
5912.600,5913.700," to just this"
5915.700,5916.400," so it's got"
5917.500,5918.300," a new one"
5919.300,5919.800," around"
5922.600,5923.100," practice"
5923.900,5924.400," guidance"
5928.100,5928.800," but what is"
5930.100,5931.000," but why is it"
5932.300,5932.600," okay"
5933.900,5934.300," so just"
5934.800,5935.300," pay attention"
5936.000,5936.500," to this"
5937.900,5938.300," now"
5939.500,5939.700," here"
5941.000,5942.300," this I mean this is"
5943.700,5945.500," all of us right now this"
5946.700,5946.800," this"
5950.800,5951.500," just this"
5953.500,5954.500," why is it alright"
5955.400,5955.800," and enough"
5956.900,5957.200," to give"
5958.000,5959.400," really give our"
5960.400,5961.500," whole Hearted"
5962.600,5963.100," awareness"
5964.300,5965.100," to just this"
5966.700,5967.100," to this"
5968.600,5969.700," to this because"
5970.300,5970.700," actually"
5971.700,5973.000," what else is that"
5974.400,5974.900," actually"
5975.200,5975.800," truly"
5977.600,5978.600," what else is that"
5983.300,5985.700," you know it's a it's a it's a thing I hear"
5986.900,5988.400," quite commonly actually that"
5989.600,5992.600," you know somebody reads some piece of guidance"
5993.500,5996.900," that was intended as just sort of practice guidance"
5997.700,6000.800," but it went deeper it went deep into them because"
6001.600,6005.200," they didn't take it as just practice guides they took it as somehow"
6005.600,6009.300," it was able to land as a pointer about the nature of experience"
6010.000,6010.900," about reality"
6011.500,6013.600," and boom instead of went right through them and"
6014.300,6016.500," they had some kind of Awakening as a result"
6017.300,6017.800," so all"
6019.800,6024.100," alright it's a mind field you know we're it's a it's a it's it's a"
6024.600,6028.800," it's it's a it's it's this whole world all our life is filled with"
6029.400,6030.500," little hints and"
6031.300,6034.000," nudges and there's all trying to wake us up you know"
6034.800,6036.600," actually I think I feel"
6037.500,6038.800," that the reality"
6040.000,6042.000," was Awakening reveals which is"
6042.400,6043.500," multifaceted"
6044.400,6046.100," is always trying to reach us"
6047.100,6050.200," I mean it's not it's probably not exactly relational you know"
6050.700,6051.400," let's take it as a"
6051.700,6053.100," will quite like that but"
6053.700,6054.200," somehow"
6054.900,6056.800," we're always on the brink of Falling into it"
6058.000,6059.300," and we always stop us ourselves"
6060.500,6063.500," oh yes I mean I know I am you know but actually"
6064.300,6065.300," it's always"
6067.000,6068.200," boring through the cracks"
6069.500,6070.100," you know and"
6071.500,6072.500," and we just somehow"
6074.100,6079.700," we've got our we got our way and no no I'm not I'm not looking over there I'm looking here I go to this"
6080.400,6082.000," this next thing on my list you know"
6082.700,6085.900," and this is what my life looks like and this is who I am and"
6088.600,6090.700," I don't I don't I didn't know it was possible"
6092.100,6092.800," to breathe"
6093.800,6094.500," and to let"
6096.600,6098.100," something boundless"
6099.900,6100.400," to itself"
6102.400,6102.700," but"
6103.100,6104.800," here again all these"
6108.000,6110.200," pointers about practice our actually"
6111.100,6111.700," pointers about"
6112.900,6113.900," this you know"
6115.000,6116.800," reality the nature of things"
6120.700,6122.300," so let's say anybody else want to"
6122.700,6123.500," yes great"
6124.100,6124.800," Greg hi"
6126.900,6127.600," hi Henry"
6130.100,6133.100," I'm trying to formulate this word because I"
6133.700,6136.000," it feels like"
6136.900,6140.100," it's this Awakening I mean it feels like it"
6140.800,6144.300," could be kind of this grand irony you know the"
6145.500,6147.700," I think the Cosmic joke I mean"
6148.200,6148.800," the fact that"
6149.700,6150.800," oh it's just this"
6151.300,6153.100," you know this this sense of"
6154.000,6156.400," you know kind of it's everywhere and"
6157.600,6158.800," yeah I am I've had these"
6159.600,6162.300," I have had these moments and actually just"
6163.300,6170.300," other people's writing can bring it out particularly some of the name Joan tell us and she just keep constantly points back and says it's just this"
6171.000,6171.600," it's simply that"
6172.300,6172.500," and it's"
6173.100,6179.600," there's always this part of me and it's like well you need this like you know this right now or that you know and so"
6180.500,6181.000," I mean really"
6181.900,6184.500," anyway it's it feels like I feel like partially"
6185.500,6193.600," it's like my heart understands it but my mind is like no it can't be I mean it's been kind of a boring Sunday and it's like it can't be this"
6194.800,6200.400," anyway just seems like this this grand irony that I I can't teach my month my"
6201.100,6203.500," my brain can't fully grasp because it's"
6204.700,6207.900," anyway yeah so I'm stumbling over words but it's just like"
6208.700,6214.500," way can't be that since that's too simple it's like everything I do and then of course all my searching and seeking which I"
6215.200,6219.300," been at this for 78 years intensely it all kind of seems really funny"
6221.200,6222.000," yeah so yeah"
6222.300,6227.900," yep thank you thank you Greg I think I think there is indeed that aspect to it"
6229.500,6229.700," the"
6230.400,6237.100," the the Cosmic joke the great cosmic joke and it's and it in fact it's not just about our seeking"
6238.000,6240.700," the joke isn't only about our seeking it's like"
6243.200,6245.200," oh what the whole thing is being"
6245.600,6247.000," what the whole thing is being"
6247.400,6248.800," including our seeking"
6249.000,6249.200," you know"
6250.100,6252.400," it is a kind of cosmic joke but on the other hand"
6253.100,6254.500," I mean I've got it also say"
6255.300,6257.200," it's not just a joke because"
6258.100,6258.600," um"
6263.900,6266.600," I think is it's it's it's not only seeing"
6267.400,6267.800," oh"
6268.700,6270.900," there was nothing to seek it's been here all along"
6273.400,6276.000," it's what the implication of that is"
6276.700,6278.900," that they're really was nothing"
6279.600,6280.100," to seek"
6281.800,6283.400," and the thing about it is"
6284.100,6288.800," it could sound like oh okay so there's no point all the seeking it's all just as I thought it was"
6289.500,6290.400," but it's not that"
6291.800,6292.000," it's"
6292.700,6294.100," there was nothing a Sikh"
6295.000,6296.500," my seeking only"
6297.600,6298.300," obscured"
6301.100,6301.500," and"
6301.900,6302.400," actually"
6303.300,6303.700," it is"
6304.200,6304.700," in"
6305.300,6307.100," unspeakably beautiful"
6308.200,6309.100," it's not just"
6310.800,6311.700," business as usual"
6313.400,6315.800," it's it's like yes there's nothing to find"
6316.400,6317.500," yes it's already here"
6318.200,6319.100," yes the seeking"
6322.300,6328.500," obscures it but maybe in some ways it's also necessary because some of these got a shift that we can't make shift"
6329.400,6333.300," because we're so locked onto our way of understanding and we don't even know that we are"
6336.400,6337.600," and so when"
6339.000,6340.700," the punchline is delivered"
6341.200,6341.800," as it were"
6342.600,6343.800," it is actually"
6345.600,6346.200," just the same"
6346.800,6349.100," and astonishingly different at the same time"
6350.200,6351.000," so it's not like"
6351.800,6354.200," therefore it's not worth all this bother"
6355.500,6358.000," that's that's the thing it is actually worth"
6358.900,6360.800," I mean almost any amount of bother"
6361.300,6365.300," it almost is to maybe to say that it's worth any amount of bother"
6366.400,6368.300," of effort and"
6369.800,6371.400," frustration and you know"
6374.100,6375.400," frequent disappointment"
6375.800,6379.200," and boredom in it anyway"
6379.600,6380.700," thank you very much for bringing that up"
6380.800,6382.100," Matthew and then Jen"
6382.600,6383.600," and we'll see how we do have time"
6384.000,6384.100," yeah"
6387.100,6387.600," Henry"
6387.900,6392.700," I'm not sure what my question is in this but more of a description of where I feel I'm at"
6393.200,6393.400," with"
6393.900,6396.000," my posture or integration towards"
6396.700,6397.100," thought"
6397.900,6399.000," I find I can"
6399.600,6401.800," honestly between cherishing thought"
6402.400,6404.000," and rejecting thought"
6404.600,6404.700," and"
6406.000,6407.200," my intuition tells me"
6408.300,6412.300," that the deeper part is letting go of both the cherishing"
6412.900,6413.900," and the rejecting"
6414.500,6416.300," and that they're just is thought"
6417.100,6418.500," that rests with me"
6419.800,6421.900," but I find fear towards"
6422.600,6424.500," or clinging towards"
6425.200,6425.500," thought"
6426.100,6428.000," and then fear towards letting a go"
6428.800,6434.100," and what is the deeper position of that the deeper posture of that is there just"
6434.900,6436.100," thought as it is"
6436.900,6437.600," is there a"
6438.300,6442.100," specific relationship towards thought or posture towards thought what would you"
6444.000,6444.100," say"
6444.700,6447.200," yeah I love that that's very finely observed"
6448.500,6454.900," good mindfulness I would say and good Curiosity and probably some energy for practice around it"
6455.600,6457.300," great I would"
6458.600,6460.500," guess that it might be"
6461.300,6461.900," fruitful"
6463.300,6469.100," to do the thing that I would imagine you don't particularly want to do which is feel that fear"
6470.400,6471.500," if there's fear"
6472.200,6476.200," about releasing or Letting Go thought and there's fear about"
6476.900,6478.100," holding on to thought"
6478.700,6479.900," I would say"
6482.100,6483.900," experience the fear"
6485.700,6487.800," you know which of course none of us wants to do"
6489.100,6490.200," but allow it"
6491.000,6493.600," can you find a space of allowing"
6494.700,6496.900," that's a little bit larger than the fear"
6497.900,6499.300," can you find a kind of"
6500.900,6501.200," yeah"
6502.900,6503.800," and allowing"
6504.500,6505.700," the true welcoming"
6507.200,6510.000," of the fear that you have you have the capacity"
6510.900,6511.400," to do that"
6512.900,6513.500," so be"
6514.300,6516.300," see what is like we'll see what happens just"
6517.300,6517.700," welcome"
6518.500,6519.900," be with allow"
6521.900,6522.300," the fear"
6525.400,6527.800," and just we'll see what happens let's try that"
6528.200,6528.500," Jen"
6530.200,6531.900," thanks Matthew Jen thank you"
6533.000,6537.000," a Henry thank you for a wonderful meditation and a talk this is a"
6537.500,6538.400," practice question"
6539.700,6541.800," I am sitting with moo and I'm"
6542.300,6544.500," I'm just noticing like"
6544.900,6553.300," okay hey move moo okay now I need to notice the thoughts okay now I have bodies sensations now I have this there's just a lot of activity kind of going between"
6554.400,6557.800," sitting with moo and noticing radio video"
6558.700,6561.500," body heart because I'm listening to your app which I love"
6562.300,6564.500," and I'm just wondering if you have any"
6565.400,6565.800," thoughts"
6566.500,6567.700," suggestions on how to"
6568.400,6570.200," to do that with more ease I have not"
6570.800,6573.500," I'm struggling to find to do with ease to notice"
6574.300,6576.800," to sit with moo while also practicing"
6578.400,6580.000," the mindfulness tips and tricks thanks"
6581.000,6590.100," yes that's great that's great I mean here's the thing what we want to get that by the way for the folks who don't know who is a coin it's often used as a first Cohen just the letters"
6590.500,6592.700," mu you just say it in your mind move"
6593.400,6597.600," it's a mad practice and I'll I can talk more about it if there's curiosity but"
6598.200,6602.300," gentlemen the thing what we're hoping to do with moose get to a point where"
6603.300,6603.700," um"
6606.300,6606.700," we just"
6608.200,6609.400," get absorbed in moo"
6610.100,6610.400," and so"
6611.000,6613.500," with use the mindfulness methods"
6614.400,6617.300," for when we're not for when we're away from moon"
6618.600,6618.700," and"
6619.700,6621.400," use them as much as we need to"
6622.100,6623.800," and then come back to move"
6624.300,6625.400," and let me be the"
6625.800,6629.100," priority if you are sitting with mood Let It Be the priority"
6629.900,6630.700," so let yourself"
6631.400,6633.400," I mean it can become quite magnetic"
6634.000,6638.100," at least at times not consistently but it will at times become magnetic and you get kind of"
6638.700,6640.200," pulled back to move again and again"
6640.600,6642.500," and you just let that happen and ride it"
6643.100,6643.200," and"
6646.100,6651.500," another thing you can do I don't want to overload your confused things but you can actually use moo as a label"
6651.900,6655.800," so you just label everything move a thought comes up that's move"
6656.100,6657.500," feeling comes up that's move"
6657.800,6660.500," your knee that's move so just let move"
6661.000,6663.600," b an all-purpose mindfulness label"
6664.300,6664.900," that's probably"
6666.800,6670.300," not a bad thing to try okay so let's see how that goes"
6671.100,6671.300," and"
6672.500,6676.300," we're getting I think Doug if it's a short one it'd be lovely to hear from you but"
6677.900,6679.300," we'll have to wrap up"
6679.800,6680.200," shortly"
6681.000,6681.000," so"
6681.800,6682.200," why don't we see"
6685.800,6686.400," this was about"
6686.900,6691.700," fear I think Matthew touched on it so got lucky it's relatively short"
6692.300,6693.800," and two things"
6694.200,6695.800," loved your description of"
6696.300,6698.700," steps towards Awakening because I've been"
6699.600,6700.100," really viewing"
6700.700,6703.800," completely drop I've been sitting with move for"
6704.100,6711.600," five years and really feeling like something big may happen and turning it into something big and lots of Fear about Letting Go"
6712.200,6717.000," and The Thread bear carpet the seven steps really helped me sort of sneak attack back into"
6718.100,6719.700," the mind of just sit"
6720.400,6720.500," so I"
6722.900,6723.300," was it"
6724.000,6726.100," lovely lovely well you got it"
6726.400,6728.600," you know if it's fear it's just be with a fear"
6728.900,6730.300," behind the way of allowing it"
6731.100,6735.400," and it's very likely wrong anyway in the case of move so they don't worry about that"
6735.900,6736.700," but it'll come up"
6737.200,6740.800," and just just yeah just sit just sit exactly"
6741.900,6742.100," um"
6742.700,6744.300," now Judith I think"
6745.600,6747.900," well if it was really brief let's should we"
6749.200,6750.100," did you feel it's a"
6751.400,6752.000," a brief thing"
6754.000,6755.400," I'm not hearing I think you're muted"
6760.600,6760.700," hi"
6761.500,6761.800," hi"
6765.200,6773.000," I have been assured shins it I've been a student of shins and Young's for 27 years and my entire life I'm 76"
6774.000,6776.100," and I have been meditating since I was"
6776.800,6777.200," 20"
6778.100,6778.600," and different"
6779.100,6779.700," traditions"
6780.500,6789.500," and when you just said meditate enlightenment is not complete until it is totally washed away and you don't remember anything about it"
6790.600,6791.700," this is happened to me"
6793.600,6793.700," and"
6794.500,6803.400," I kept wondering until I found you I kept one because I started sitting again I stopped sitting for a while I mean it was like all everything was gone"
6804.800,6811.200," and I spent my whole life during this and everything is gone I used to have these incredible experiences all the time"
6811.900,6815.600," and now you just said that and I wanted to tell you"
6816.600,6816.800," that"
6817.500,6818.300," my heart"
6819.700,6820.700," just opened"
6822.100,6824.900," to this incredible thing you just gave me"
6825.800,6831.000," I'm I have Goosebumps all over and my whole body feels like it's opened up"
6831.800,6832.100," and"
6832.800,6834.800," I thank you so much"
6835.600,6843.300," somebody said to I mean somebody gave me your name and I I had never heard of you and he said no this is really wonderful because he does it"
6844.000,6845.600," with you the original love"

6847.900,6853.400," god I could teach this by did teach this we were I was a teacher for shins and young for"
6854.100,6855.200," for a really long time"
6856.100,6861.800," and I did it any way and I just got back into meditation I mean it was just delicious"
6862.800,6863.500," and now"
6864.100,6868.100," you said this today I mean I want to jump into I want to hug you"

6876.700,6877.400," all the time"
6878.200,6879.900," I don't even have to think about it"
6881.100,6881.800," and well"
6883.300,6888.000," it's just so amazingly wonderful to be validated that's all"
6888.700,6892.800," due to thank you so much for sharing that I'm getting Goosebumps too I'm not"
6893.100,6895.900," I want to just pass it alright back to dogen because he said"
6896.600,6898.400," and this traceless"
6899.100,6900.200," this traceless"
