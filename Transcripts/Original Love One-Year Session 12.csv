5.100,11.400," and on behalf of the original of team"
12.000,14.300," I want to welcome everyone of you"
14.700,20.000," and every part of every one of you to this Sunday Session with Henry"
21.100,26.600," whether you're with us in real time or watching the recording we're so happy you're here"
28.100,35.300," today we finish up a three-part series called doing an undoing exploring the factors of Awakening"
36.100,42.000," and I don't know about you but I'm excited to find out how Henri will unfold this theme today"
44.800,45.300," but first"
46.000,52.900," we'd love to hear from you so please drop a line in the chat telling us we're using in from how the weather is inside and out"
54.000,62.700," and if you'd rather not engage via the chat that's fine perhaps just take a moment to turn on gallery view and take in all these beautiful faces"
63.800,66.000," don't do this alone"
69.600,73.600," ah let's see so we have somebody in Tucson"
74.000,77.000," where it's 108 outside and cool inside"
77.500,79.200," common steamy and Brooklyn"
80.000,81.100," body day in Missouri"
81.800,84.300," move Valencia Spain sunny and hot"
85.300,86.200," Emmy and DC"
87.400,88.900," beautiful in the Azores"
93.500,97.600," unsettled and happy to be here I'm sunny clear Seattle"
98.800,99.800," funny London"
100.700,105.600," honey outside not so much on the inside in the Netherlands cool and Santa Barbara"
106.800,111.200," onion warm inside and out and Vancouver British Columbia"
113.600,115.700," lovely summer day in Albuquerque"
117.200,118.300," zooming in from Boulder"
118.900,122.400," outside warm inside like a windlass place"
124.500,126.800," I'm going to sit in that windowless place"
127.800,127.900," and"
129.700,131.200," this over to"
132.000,132.600," Henry"
133.400,135.600," hi Sarah hi everybody"
136.200,137.000," Sarah thank you for"
137.800,140.300," welcome welcoming us all in and thank you everybody"
141.600,142.300," for coming"
142.700,143.000," on"
144.100,144.700," into this"
146.000,147.000," what Valerie"
147.300,150.800," forceman roshi articles the zendo without walls"
151.700,153.200," this zoom space"
154.100,154.900," which is a kind of"
157.100,158.900," some sort of a similac room of"
159.200,164.600," in a way of what we might find happening in our sitting practice where"
166.800,168.400," there's this mysterious shift"
169.500,171.000," where we go from"
171.800,172.700," being caught up"
174.100,174.800," and"
175.300,176.400," identified and"
177.300,177.700," with"
178.600,183.800," our lives and and with what may be going on in our immediate experience inwardly and outwardly"
185.000,188.100," and kind of in some way fixated as a sense of self"
189.400,195.800," in a world that it has decided it knows how it all is and has its own particular filters on"
197.700,201.000," and I'm sure all of us have experienced this that at some point"
203.300,205.400," in many sit or in a rare sit"
205.900,207.800," this shift happens where"
208.700,209.000," um"
210.200,214.200," things can actually remain much the same"
215.100,216.300," but our relationship"
217.200,217.900," with them"
218.500,219.400," shifts"
220.200,222.800," and the nature of that shift is that"
224.200,225.500," when it's happened"
226.500,227.800," we're kind of okay"
228.300,228.500," with"
229.300,229.900," how things are"
230.600,233.200," you know they for example we may be sitting with stress"
233.700,234.400," you know we may feel"
235.300,239.000," you know something we're worried about and we might be able to track it in the body"
239.700,240.900," oh yeah there's this kind of"
241.400,242.800," zone of Honey's"
243.500,244.400," in my trunk"
245.900,246.500," and it's there"
247.600,248.400," and we're kind of"
249.000,250.300," probably bothered by it"
251.100,254.200," and then this mysterious shift happens where"
255.000,256.200," it's still there"
257.400,258.100," but I'm okay"
259.300,259.500," and"
260.500,263.500," that's one big characteristic of the shift"
264.100,265.000," and another is that"
268.100,268.600," I'm aware"
269.300,271.100," I just know I'm aware now"
272.100,273.100," I am sitting"
274.200,275.400," in a state of awareness"
276.400,277.900," and that awareness"
278.400,278.600," is"
279.900,282.400," is in some ways at peace with itself"
284.000,286.500," and therefore can be at peace"
287.400,287.800," for example"
288.700,290.100," where the condition of stress"
290.800,291.900," there's present in the body"
292.600,294.500," so the beautiful thing about the shift"
295.500,296.600," is that it"
296.800,297.500," allows"
298.300,299.100," whatever is going on"
300.200,300.700," it's actually"
301.700,303.500," in a sense unconditional"
304.800,305.000," it's"
305.900,307.300," it's a shift that doesn't"
308.900,312.500," only happen because we've somehow got rid of our stress"
313.200,313.500," no"
314.400,315.400," that that would be"
316.800,319.700," sort of something else that may or may not happen"
320.300,321.400," this is different it's"
322.100,323.500," it lets the stress be present"
324.700,326.000," but it's not bothered by"
326.900,327.100," and"
327.700,329.100," in my hole kind of"
331.300,334.100," I don't know zone of fascination is last year's is"
334.800,335.300," how do we"
336.900,341.400," how do we make that shift more readily available to more people"
342.000,343.900," and you know I don't think of this as"
344.500,345.200," a blinding"
345.700,347.100," revelatory Awakening"
348.200,350.300," but I think of it as an extremely helpful"
351.500,353.300," thing that we humans are pre"
354.000,355.700," pre-made with we come"
356.500,358.000," we all come with access"
359.100,362.000," to whatever that spacious awareness is"
363.000,364.600," the happens in this shift"
365.500,369.100," you know we all we all have it is not some"
369.800,371.200," adepts thing"
371.800,375.600," you know only the adult can cultivate it I don't believe that at all I think"
376.200,377.100," we all have it"
377.800,380.000," and the big question on my mind is how"
380.500,381.500," to make that more"
382.100,383.600," readily available and"
384.200,387.200," you know I know I've used a lot you know heard those of you are familiar with"
387.700,390.800," you know what I have to offer I talk a lot about allowing"
391.700,392.300," because I think"
393.200,393.900," allowing"
394.700,400.100," is one step to Wards switching that on because one of the things that that"
400.900,402.100," does is it allows"
402.700,404.700," it allows so that's why"
405.700,408.700," things don't have to change experience doesn't have to change"
409.300,410.100," it's just the"
411.400,412.500," this income more"
413.100,414.900," slightly broader"
416.200,418.400," more encompassing kind of awareness"
420.300,420.600," we just"
421.300,422.800," find we've got access to it"
423.500,424.200," and here it is"
425.100,425.600," therefore"
426.400,428.100," allowing comes online"
429.000,429.200," because"
430.400,432.000," one of the key properties of that"
434.200,434.400," that"
434.800,439.300," if I can call it awareness I'm not even sure that's exactly the right term but let's call it awareness for now"
439.500,441.600," one of its key properties is that it does"
442.500,442.800," allow"
444.100,444.700," meaning"
445.200,446.300," you don't actually have to go"
447.000,447.100," from"
447.900,453.700," the this ordinary human being fallible and and and and and and anxious that I am"
454.100,456.000," with my thin skin you know and all"
456.500,458.700," inherited trauma of generations"
459.300,462.000," you know the the gets stressed very easily"
464.000,465.200," you don't have to stop being that"
467.300,470.200," all all all that needs to have world"
470.500,471.800," all the can happen"
472.500,473.900," is a shift where"
475.000,476.500," that suffering being"
477.200,477.700," is actually"
479.100,479.600," within"
480.500,481.300," a broader"
482.300,482.700," state"
483.300,483.900," of allowing"
484.800,485.500," and awareness"
486.000,486.200," that"
487.100,488.200," can't help but"
489.000,489.400," all"
490.100,491.100," you know it's a very"
491.900,493.500," beautiful thing actually"
495.000,496.400," and you know it's a sort of"
496.900,498.200," it's a different way of thinking about"
498.600,499.600," quote unquote healing"
500.500,501.400," because we normally think"
502.200,504.100," with a kind of physiological model"
505.000,506.900," that healing means"
507.700,509.400," the Wounded part goes away"
510.300,511.500," it's thinner the cut"
511.900,512.500," closes up"
513.400,513.800," the skin"
514.600,517.300," is a little tender at first but then it gets stronger"
518.100,520.700," there might be a scar left their might not be a scholar left"
521.300,521.500," but"
521.900,523.600," the wound has actually gone"
524.500,526.000," but in this kind of"
527.800,528.700," shift on talking about"
529.400,530.100," it's not like that"
531.100,532.000," the wound"
533.100,534.400," if I use that language"
535.000,535.700," can remain"
537.100,539.000," actually the womb can become"
539.800,542.400," a really helpful beautiful wanted"
542.700,543.100," thing"
544.000,544.600," because"
545.900,546.400," somehow"
547.600,550.000," it may even help us to find this"
550.600,551.100," larger"
552.200,554.200," space of awareness that"
555.100,555.500," allows"
557.600,557.800," okay"
558.300,558.500," so"
559.000,560.000," why have I gone on about that"
560.700,562.200," at the start because that's what we're going to be"
562.800,563.900," exploring in this set"
564.700,565.700," we're going to be seeing"
567.300,568.500," without trying"
570.400,572.500," if we can all get a taste of this shift so"
573.300,576.500," I you know I'm going to do my best but I can't guarantee a thing"
577.000,577.400," you know and"
578.500,580.000," but we'll just see whether"
581.000,583.200," we can recognise this kind of shift"
584.300,584.800," possibly"
585.500,587.600," but without looking for it because if we look for it"
589.200,590.300," that's the same"
591.100,592.300," identifying mind"
593.300,594.600," trying to make something happen"
595.200,596.400," and it doesn't come on that way"
597.200,597.400," okay"
598.200,599.200," let's go into the sipp"
599.800,600.400," so please"
601.300,604.400," kind of do whatever you feel you need to do before we start sitting"
605.500,609.200," you know you might want to rock around a bit you might even want to stand out and sit down again"
609.700,612.000," whenever feels right for you to get into"
614.900,616.400," you know the the place of being"
617.900,621.000," basically okay with having the body be still"
621.400,621.900," for a while"
631.300,631.500," either"
633.500,640.200," either have your eyes open with but lower the gaze somewhat at least 30 degrees or something 45 degrees"
641.400,643.300," all you can have your eyes closed"
649.400,650.500," that don't really have to be"
651.100,653.600," gazing at the screen by the way it just"
654.300,655.800," you don't have to do that at all you can"
660.200,661.700," be sideways to it if you want"
664.100,667.600," let's start by making sure that that the arms are loose"
668.300,669.600," sort of dangling like"
670.100,670.700," like ropes"
671.300,672.000," just hanging"
673.800,674.400," and let that"
675.800,676.700," release"
677.400,680.400," sense in the arms that it extend down into the fingers"
682.500,685.900," so all the fingers are like sort of the frayed ends of the Rope"
686.400,687.000," just hanging"
690.700,693.400," if you're sitting with your spine free make"
694.400,696.800," makes subtle adjustments to Let It Be upright"
698.100,701.100," so there's minimum effort involved"
702.300,703.700," minimum holding"
706.000,707.400," involved in staying upright"
711.500,712.600," yeah let it get your insurance"
714.500,715.000," release"
718.400,719.100," your"
719.400,720.600," throat shoulders"
721.800,723.000," all releasing"
725.700,726.800," becoming Slack"
728.400,729.000," face"
729.300,729.900," also"
732.000,734.900," like a like a sale and an old tall ship"
736.500,737.800," that all the canvas"
738.800,739.500," of the sale"
740.400,741.100," of the face"
742.300,743.000," just hang"
754.300,755.700," now be aware of the seat"
757.700,760.100," you might feel just a little more weight"
760.700,761.600," in the seat"
763.800,765.500," that could be a signal that"
767.100,767.900," some release"
768.400,769.200," has already happened"
770.900,772.700," but not to worry if you don't feel that"
774.800,775.900," so feel the seat"
777.400,778.600," and feel the"
779.700,781.800," top of the skull the whole Dome"
783.200,784.200," at the top of the skull"
788.300,792.400," and be aware of something like the space between the two"
795.100,796.200," where the body is"
806.900,808.000," can you sense"
809.600,812.300," that whole body field between the seat"
813.300,814.600," and the cranium"
816.200,818.700," can you sense it as a kind of space"
826.900,829.700," and can you let everything in that space"
831.500,832.200," release"
837.100,838.400," so it's all just"
839.800,841.600," a loose open space"
854.100,858.100," and you know gently there's a there's a kind of awareness of all of that"
859.000,861.100," doesn't have to be exact and precise"
863.300,866.200," I kind of general awareness of that whole field"
868.400,870.500," I'm kranium down to seat"
879.700,883.200," and letting that awareness spread into the upper legs"
884.700,885.400," knees"
888.000,889.100," lower legs"
891.900,892.600," ankles"
896.000,896.500," feet"
898.000,898.800," and toes"
905.600,910.900," oh my now be some subtle sense of a kind of energy field"
912.100,912.900," encompassing"
914.000,914.800," a whole body"
932.600,936.300," so of a vague general awareness also"
937.700,939.200," encompassing the whole body"
950.800,951.400," remembering"
952.900,957.700," you know a never striving for anything exact or perfect in practice"
959.100,961.500," practice is always imperfect"
965.000,967.500," it it's not interested in perfection"
975.100,978.000," it's always a bit hitting miss and higgledy-piggledy"
979.800,980.900," and that's just fine"
986.900,989.600," you know we might find oh wow I'm really present"
991.000,992.500," then I thought comes and I'm not"
995.200,996.500," that's fine it's thought"
997.600,998.700," dissipates and I'm"
999.800,1000.600," I'm back again"
1002.200,1002.600," present"
1009.800,1010.700," and other thought"
1012.000,1014.100," whoops I wasn't present no problem"
1018.800,1019.400," no problem"
1030.500,1032.400," so rather than being"
1033.600,1034.900," a problem solving"
1036.300,1036.800," method"
1038.600,1040.300," practice isn't that at all"
1050.100,1054.800," it's in some way more about releasing the need to solve problems"
1056.800,1058.800," right so of course isn't always easy"
1064.500,1065.400," but what if"
1067.600,1068.300," it was okay"
1073.000,1074.300," but they're beer space"
1075.700,1076.400," in you"
1079.100,1080.200," where there's no need"
1081.100,1082.100," to solve problems"
1088.100,1091.800," it doesn't mean we're going to sort of flake out on life and"
1092.800,1094.900," it just means that there's a space"
1096.500,1098.900," that might be really restorative"
1101.200,1102.400," regenerative"
1106.700,1107.900," that we can come back to"
1112.300,1113.900," where we're actually okay"
1116.800,1117.700," just as we are"
1132.900,1135.400," just a space which is a birthright"
1139.600,1140.100," where in"
1141.500,1142.500," in a weird way"
1143.100,1144.000," perhaps they're"
1144.900,1146.600," there are no problems to solve"
1155.800,1157.100," an unconditioned"
1158.600,1159.200," space"
1183.200,1184.400," a space where"
1185.300,1186.700," practice itself"
1187.800,1189.400," is not some kind of"
1190.500,1192.100," problem to wrestle with"
1197.700,1199.300," is a release of that"
1207.000,1208.200," again it doesn't mean"
1209.800,1210.200," that we're"
1211.000,1216.200," pretending there's no things to be dealt Within life in the world and in ourselves"
1219.700,1221.600," it's rather it's a space"
1224.300,1225.800," perhaps a kind of awareness"
1228.500,1230.300," that is just a bit"
1231.600,1232.500," larger"
1235.800,1237.300," just a little bit"
1238.700,1239.300," broader"
1251.100,1252.400," that can hold"
1256.300,1257.200," all that we are"
1263.100,1264.100," and allow"
1266.700,1267.600," all of me"
1275.700,1277.800," are it's a little bit radical"
1282.600,1284.900," only because we're conditioned"
1286.400,1286.400," to"
1287.700,1289.200," to kind of clean on to"
1291.600,1293.300," the things we need to wrestle with"
1296.000,1298.000," so it is a bit radical"
1304.900,1306.300," in notice is"
1308.300,1310.200," um impastor"
1310.700,1311.500," to cling"
1314.600,1317.300," and it doesn't try to get rid of that"
1320.400,1320.700," this"
1322.200,1323.600," space of allowing"
1327.200,1328.100," awareness"
1331.500,1333.600," his his completely happy"
1335.900,1336.900," to encompass"
1339.600,1340.700," our impulse"
1342.900,1343.400," to clean"
1347.400,1348.100," to resist"
1350.700,1351.600," in allows them"
1360.300,1363.700," and nothing needs to be got rid of"
1371.600,1373.200," Whatever May come up"
1376.000,1377.900," is actually allowed"
1403.400,1407.300," so you know you can you can track in your body see if there's"
1408.500,1411.200," some trace of unece somewhere"
1413.700,1414.400," and don't"
1415.100,1416.500," imagine it's a problem"
1420.800,1422.400," don't think it must be"
1423.600,1424.400," banished"
1427.800,1428.100," no"
1431.300,1432.200," this is counterintuitive"
1436.500,1438.200," a little bit radical"
1442.400,1443.900," let it be allowed"
1450.200,1452.400," let it even be wanted"
1463.100,1464.400," what if he even"
1465.800,1466.800," his loved"
1492.900,1495.400," he might notice that the body system"
1497.600,1498.900," perhaps has become"
1501.100,1502.400," a bit more restful"
1516.600,1518.500," you might notice that the"
1519.900,1521.200," the mind system"
1524.100,1527.300," is just tasting a bit more quiet"
1530.200,1531.400," and he's"
1556.200,1559.500," and it's really okay to rest here"
1581.000,1582.800," and you might notice that"
1584.000,1585.400," in the heart system"
1587.500,1588.900," the emotions system"
1591.600,1592.600," some of this"
1594.500,1596.000," allowing this"
1597.900,1600.100," can kind of intermingle"
1602.100,1603.500," infuse"
1604.800,1605.600," a little bit"
1607.600,1609.000," into the heart system"
1613.500,1615.500," so nothing need to"
1658.500,1659.300," chain notice"
1661.200,1662.000," stillness"
1674.600,1676.200," notice the quality"
1677.600,1678.800," of stillness"
1713.300,1714.500," notice how"
1715.300,1717.200," anything that comes up"
1719.500,1720.700," it can be"
1722.000,1722.900," allowed"
1730.300,1733.400," suppose some kind of tension or tightness"
1734.600,1737.300," you know appears in your awareness"
1740.600,1741.600," is possible"
1743.800,1745.000," to allow it"
1751.600,1753.300," what if it doesn't need"
1754.300,1755.100," to change"
1777.800,1779.200," or if it's all"
1781.400,1782.500," it's wanted"
1785.200,1785.800," is love"
1808.800,1811.600," what if his like the grit in the oyster"
1812.800,1814.200," that becomes the pear"
1859.200,1860.800," notice the quiet"
1868.800,1871.100," the quality of quietness"
1885.700,1887.700," what's quietness like"
1906.700,1908.200," turn quietness"
1909.300,1909.900," welcome"
1911.200,1912.100," and all"
1913.600,1914.700," whatever is coming up"
1989.300,1990.800," I have is coming up"
1993.900,1995.500," let it be allowed"
2003.100,2005.600," if there's a sense of how I can't allow this"
2007.200,2008.200," allow that"
2008.600,2009.600," non allowing"
2061.300,2062.500," really it's about"
2063.500,2064.900," imperfection"
2080.100,2083.600," adding practice be radically imperfect"
2121.500,2123.300," no in this last"
2124.300,2125.800," part of the sit we can"
2127.200,2128.200," see if you like"
2129.700,2132.100," you know what's it like to notice"
2133.600,2134.600," awareness"
2139.000,2140.700," to notice being"
2141.900,2142.700," aware"
2147.400,2149.700," the quality or qualities"
2151.200,2152.200," of awareness"
2157.000,2158.600," it might be quite soft"
2164.400,2165.600," a bit tender"
2174.100,2176.400," sometimes it might be kind of clear"
2177.600,2178.200," not always"
2187.500,2188.900," i b a sense of"
2190.500,2191.900," kind of fluidity"
2194.400,2195.100," even a bit"
2195.900,2197.300," liquid somehow"
2199.900,2200.800," watery"
2204.400,2205.500," transparent"
2209.500,2210.400," flow"
2214.900,2217.000," and many other things possibly"
2240.800,2241.700," if it's not"
2242.800,2244.800," particularly accessible right now"
2246.200,2248.800," I will find that rest is the"
2250.000,2251.800," is the way to go going to"
2253.600,2254.600," really resting"
2257.200,2258.400," restfulness"
2262.800,2264.300," not really doing anything"
2270.800,2272.900," but really not doing anything"
2307.500,2308.100,"quiet"
2318.900,2319.800," still aware"
2327.600,2328.300," allowing"
2335.800,2336.600," resting"
2457.100,2458.700,"allowing allow"
2487.100,2492.100," and invite you to keep going if that feels like the right thing for you just flow on"
2493.700,2495.500," and for those who"
2497.400,2500.300," feel it's right to end the meditation now please go ahead"
2501.100,2502.700," and we'll have a little break"
2504.500,2506.000," let's see we'll ri"
2506.200,2508.300," convene at um"
2509.200,2512.500," 48 minutes past the hour that's in six minutes"
2514.000,2517.000," so see you in a little bit whichever you choose to do"
2518.300,2519.800," thank you all very very much for being"
2520.500,2521.500," being here today"

2741.300,2743.700," welcome back everybody and"
2745.700,2746.800,"oh thank you Henry for that"
2747.800,2750.200," beautiful guidance into"
2751.100,2753.000," a genderless allowing"
2755.800,2758.400," I'm going to do a few announcements now before"
2760.500,2761.700," and we speaks"
2762.500,2764.300," the first one is that"
2765.300,2768.400," it's book launch week and originally love has"
2768.800,2771.100," already become a best seller on Amazon"
2772.000,2773.500," and you can still become an early"
2773.900,2774.400," supporter"
2775.000,2775.700," though I will"
2776.200,2778.400," put in the chat the link"
2779.100,2779.200," to"
2780.000,2780.800," how to order that"
2781.500,2784.900," as well as some other other things coming up and just"
2785.900,2787.900," you know suggest that it makes a great gift"
2789.300,2790.300," a few upcoming events"
2791.700,2798.400," Friday July 19th will be an original book reading in Berkeley California in person and online"
2799.100,2801.800," and then the following weekend July 2021"
2802.800,2804.700," a weekend Retreat also in Berkeley"
2805.200,2806.600," also in person and online"
2807.500,2813.800," and then our next original love Sunday Session is August 4th with guest teacher Kelly boys"
2814.400,2816.400," and details on that will"
2816.900,2817.500," come soon"
2819.200,2822.200," all right that's all I've got for now"
2824.600,2826.400," back over to Henry take it away"
2827.500,2827.800," okay"
2828.900,2832.900," thanks Sarah very much thanks everybody and thanks to all of you have already uhm"
2833.800,2835.500," purchased the book that's very"
2837.300,2838.500," I'm assuming that some of you"
2839.400,2841.900," thank you for those who have if you have"
2842.500,2845.500," it's been you know it's it's been a"
2848.200,2850.300," real labour of love this book and"
2851.400,2851.900," it's kind of"
2853.000,2854.600," it's quite exciting to see"
2855.500,2856.500," what I've been sort of thinking"
2857.300,2859.800," and teaching and I think discovering over the years"
2861.600,2862.600," out in book form"
2863.100,2863.400," so it's"
2864.200,2867.500," it's kind of maximally accessible I hope you know"
2869.000,2869.200," anyway"
2870.500,2870.800," today"
2873.100,2876.300," it's our third session on doing an undoing"
2877.100,2877.700," factors"
2878.000,2878.300," of"
2879.100,2879.800," Awakening"
2880.500,2882.900," and we've looked at some of the traditional"
2884.300,2886.200," so-called factors of Awakening"
2886.600,2886.900," and"
2888.400,2889.300," being exploring"
2890.200,2892.000," what the traditions have to say about"
2893.400,2896.200," this most mysterious process of"
2897.100,2898.500," the human Discovery"
2899.400,2901.200," of something that was never hidden"
2901.900,2903.200," but somehow we"
2904.700,2907.800," we as a species I think seem to got"
2909.000,2909.800," less"
2911.300,2913.600," less known who we're here"
2914.800,2917.900," as a species we developed in such a way that it became"
2918.700,2919.300," harder"
2919.800,2919.900," to"
2920.800,2921.700," notice it"
2923.300,2923.500," over"
2924.900,2925.900," over presumably"
2926.300,2927.600," have millennia"
2929.000,2929.200," and"
2932.300,2933.800," it seems like sometimes when"
2935.200,2936.000," you know earlier times"
2937.600,2938.000," some"
2938.600,2941.800," members of the species did notice it they tended to"
2943.000,2945.000," assume it has something to do with"
2946.100,2947.400," supernatural entities"
2948.400,2950.000," you know and was kind of because it's kind of"
2950.600,2953.500," which makes a kind of sense in that it's sort of beyond"
2954.000,2957.100," it is a little beyond our normal way of experiencing things"
2958.100,2959.400," but I don't think it's"
2960.200,2962.700," supernatural at all whatever that might mean"
2963.400,2965.700," I think it's part and parcel of our human makeup"
2966.800,2970.500," and obviously I'm not alone in that many see it that way too"
2971.300,2973.800," nowadays especially nowadays when"
2974.600,2977.800," the great traditions that have kind of known about it"
2978.500,2979.300," and provided"
2980.100,2984.900," pathways that have a chance of leading US to it but never better than a chance"
2985.300,2985.400," you know"
2986.400,2988.000," because it's a long unto itself but"
2989.800,2992.100," when now that those traditions are"
2993.500,2994.900," meeting both one another"
2995.800,2996.000," and"
2997.200,2997.500," western"
2998.600,2999.100," scientific"
2999.700,3000.400," investigation"
3001.300,3003.200," you know I think we are beginning to see the"
3004.000,3004.500," you don't"
3004.900,3005.300," need"
3006.300,3007.900," theological explanations of it"
3009.800,3011.700," they're simpler explanations you know"
3012.700,3012.700," so"
3013.600,3014.000," anyway"
3014.400,3014.700," um"
3016.100,3017.300," I wanted to talk about"
3018.500,3018.800," some"
3020.500,3022.400," factors of it that aren't"
3022.700,3024.600," exactly sort of tradition based"
3026.000,3027.500," there's just kind of human"
3027.900,3028.700," based you know"
3030.200,3031.000," in this talk"
3031.900,3033.700," and I also am going to"
3034.900,3035.900," read a little bit from the book"
3036.800,3037.500," in Honour of it"
3037.800,3038.000," being"
3038.900,3039.700," the books first week"
3040.600,3041.100," in the world"
3043.400,3047.800," the first factor that I haven't really touched on I don't think so far"
3048.800,3049.100," is"
3049.800,3051.700," exemplified and embodied"
3052.000,3052.300," bye"
3054.300,3054.900," this lady"
3058.000,3058.700," Patrick chara"
3059.800,3061.800," was an early Buddhist nun"
3063.000,3064.900," and some of you have heard me talk about her before"
3066.400,3066.700," she"
3067.900,3069.000," she really lost everything"
3070.400,3072.800," in a very traumatic Catholic way"
3073.400,3073.900," there were some"
3074.300,3075.700," terrible storms and flooding"
3079.800,3082.000," and her parents died"
3082.700,3083.700," her husband died"
3084.100,3085.300," both her children died"
3086.300,3087.400," all in one night"
3088.300,3088.500," and"
3090.100,3092.600," you can read about her story on line Pat atchara"
3093.300,3095.700," and she somehow well she was"
3096.400,3097.400," besides herself she"
3098.400,3100.500," became I think temporarily and saying"
3101.800,3104.100," utterly destroyed with a catastrophic loss"
3104.900,3109.100," and somehow came to the Great Teacher shaky money Budd"
3110.000,3110.200," and"
3111.400,3113.200," she was naked and just yeah"
3114.200,3114.400," really"
3116.100,3116.600," temporarily"
3117.500,3118.400," really lost her mind"
3119.400,3123.400," and what what the Buddha sort of what he did was"
3124.200,3126.200," here she was before him and he said"
3127.100,3127.900," compose yourself"
3130.500,3130.900," you know which"
3131.800,3134.100," might sound almost a bit sterne"
3134.900,3136.300," like somewhat or steer"
3137.300,3138.100," but it worked"
3139.000,3140.200," she did sort of"
3141.400,3142.400," come back to herself"
3143.700,3146.800," where upon one of the Monks took off his Robe And"
3147.700,3149.400," draped her in it because she was naked"
3150.600,3153.000," I think her name papa jara has something to do with"
3153.800,3155.400," a cloak I think I remember reading that"
3158.000,3158.800," and she"
3160.700,3163.300," she started to practice and then times she became"
3164.100,3165.800," a leading figure in the Sanger"
3166.500,3167.100," and a great"
3168.800,3170.700," a great help and guide to many people"
3171.600,3174.300," then and on down the Generations I think as an example"
3175.300,3180.900," and the reason I'm thinking of what I'm thinking about here really is a factor of Awakening"
3181.500,3182.500," is that you know there's"
3183.100,3185.300," I don't know that there's a greater Factor"
3186.700,3187.000," than"
3187.500,3188.000," the fact that"
3188.700,3189.800," death is real"
3190.800,3192.200," and suffering is real"
3195.300,3196.200," if we didn't suffer"
3200.700,3202.000," what what would we look for"
3202.400,3202.500," you know"
3203.400,3204.300," why would we need to look"
3205.200,3206.300," why would we need to search"
3208.900,3210.300," you might say on the other hand you know"
3212.300,3214.000," the flip side of that is the term"
3215.200,3216.800," if we knew what"
3218.800,3223.100," the practice can lead us to if we knew Awakening would we then not suffer at all"
3225.000,3225.800," and I actually"
3227.600,3231.100," I I'm I reserve judgement about that because I think um"
3232.400,3233.800," the idea that somehow"
3234.900,3235.700," Awakening"
3236.700,3238.500," even really profound Awakening"
3239.100,3244.300," kind of eradicates all all trauma wiring or something"
3245.700,3247.300," I actually don't"
3247.800,3249.600," know that that's true"
3250.500,3253.800," that maybe for some it actually is I'm not sure"
3254.900,3255.100," but it"
3255.400,3257.600," wouldn't seem to need to be"
3258.400,3259.300," to me because"
3260.600,3260.900," I think"
3262.500,3265.900," enlightenment or Awakening profound Awakening even"
3266.900,3268.100," is is a is a"
3269.000,3270.700," very can be very thorough"
3271.400,3272.100," insight"
3272.400,3273.700," into the nature"
3274.600,3275.300," of all things"
3276.100,3276.800," the nature"
3277.800,3279.800," of experience itself"
3280.900,3284.900," the nature of being alive the nature of experiencing"
3285.900,3286.800," as a human being"
3287.700,3289.000," and in that sort of"
3289.400,3290.200," penetrating"
3291.200,3293.100," insight you know we do see"
3293.900,3295.200," that our sensors self"
3296.100,3297.800," is not what it appears to be"
3299.000,3299.400," in fact"
3300.100,3303.100," it's been a kind of mirage a chimera"
3303.400,3304.200," a Phantom"
3304.600,3305.700," a bubble on a stream"
3306.200,3308.600," a flicker of lightning in a summer cloud"
3310.000,3312.000," and so on these are actually traditional metaphors"
3312.700,3314.200," but we also see that"
3314.600,3317.100," the what we experienced is also"
3318.000,3319.500," those things it's also"
3320.400,3320.900," not just"
3321.300,3322.300," evanescent"
3322.500,3323.800," not just a femural"
3324.000,3324.600," ephemeral"
3325.000,3326.300," but even when it's a rising"
3326.600,3327.700," it's not actually"
3328.800,3329.400," the solid"
3329.700,3332.500," experience we think it is we take it to be"
3333.100,3334.400," it's some kind of"
3336.000,3337.000," Simulation or"
3337.600,3340.900," hallucination and some modern neuroscientists"
3341.500,3342.700," are starting to agree with this"
3343.400,3345.500," but you know leave that aside"
3346.100,3347.300," the the point is"
3349.100,3349.600," it's not"
3350.300,3351.900," how can I put it it's not conditional"
3352.500,3353.400," it's not conditional"
3354.100,3356.700," it's not like you can only see it all the trauma has gone"
3357.200,3358.400," is about trauma too"
3359.200,3360.200," nor does it mean that"
3360.600,3361.600," having seen it"
3362.200,3364.000," you know you're you're no longer"
3365.100,3367.100," a regular human being"
3367.900,3370.600," you actually are still regular human being"
3371.300,3373.000," the difference is that your relationship"
3374.000,3374.000," to"
3374.900,3376.200," all the ordinary human stuff"
3376.900,3377.000," and"
3377.800,3379.300," be radically different"
3379.800,3382.400," and in time over ongoing practice"
3383.100,3385.700," the relationship becomes can become lighter and lighter"
3386.400,3388.000," less and less resisting"
3388.400,3389.900," more and more allow"
3390.500,3391.500," and these"
3391.900,3392.800," you know the the"
3394.900,3399.100," the wisdom of the of insights that we can have that we call Awakening"
3399.600,3400.800," can radically"
3401.800,3402.800," accelerate"
3403.600,3405.100," the process of becoming"
3405.900,3406.500," ever more"
3407.100,3407.900," non-resisting"
3409.000,3409.900," non-resisting"
3410.600,3412.100," and what goes with that also"
3412.900,3413.500," non"
3414.000,3414.400," clingy"
3415.800,3416.800," non clinging"
3417.300,3418.300," non craving"
3418.700,3421.500," non craving non clinging non-resisting"
3424.200,3424.600," freer"
3424.800,3425.400," in a word"
3426.500,3429.000," you know and I think we heard Michael taft talking beautifully about"
3430.600,3432.800," what he says is the distinction between Awakening"
3433.600,3434.600," and liberation"
3434.900,3435.200," or"
3435.700,3435.900," yeah"
3437.700,3439.700," but liberation is the process of"
3440.400,3443.600," Awakening working itself through the system"
3444.500,3446.900," so that we come more we become more and more free"
3447.900,3448.200," of"
3450.600,3451.500," what we cling to"
3452.100,3453.400," the process of clinging"
3454.200,3455.400," the process of resisting"
3456.100,3456.400," but"
3458.000,3460.600," you know would this be a possibility"
3461.400,3461.800," without"
3462.500,3463.000," sough"
3465.300,3467.100," would it be investigated"
3467.900,3468.900," without suffering"
3470.800,3472.600," you can't have a pearl without"
3473.400,3473.900," the Grit"
3475.400,3476.000," the sand"
3476.700,3477.200," grain"
3479.500,3483.100," so I think our suffering is in fact a factor"
3483.400,3483.700," of"
3484.700,3485.200," Awakening"
3486.300,3487.400," and maybe that's why"
3488.400,3490.000," is the first of the four"
3491.100,3493.300," in in nobelang truths"
3495.500,3495.700," in a"
3496.200,3497.600," before Noble Truths"
3498.800,3499.800," first is there"
3500.200,3500.500," is"
3501.300,3501.800," suffering"
3503.100,3506.100," and the second is the suffering is caused by craving"
3507.100,3508.000," meaning China"
3508.800,3511.300," cling to things or to get things or to"
3512.200,3514.500," push things away actually it means all of that"
3516.800,3519.800," and then the third noble truth is that suffering"
3520.400,3520.700," can"
3521.200,3522.500," sorry craving"
3522.800,3523.100," can"
3523.900,3524.500," cease"
3528.100,3529.700," and then the fourth is a there's a path"
3530.700,3532.600," to having craving cease"
3534.900,3536.000," so it doesn't say"
3537.600,3537.800," the"
3538.200,3540.000," objects of craving"
3540.600,3543.400," the objects of resisting the objects of allowing"
3544.600,3545.200," will be gone"
3547.100,3547.600," just that"
3548.000,3548.500," the process"
3549.400,3550.100," of resisting"
3550.700,3551.400," and clinging"
3551.900,3552.600," and grasping"
3553.600,3554.200," can be"
3555.900,3556.400," I would say"
3556.800,3558.000," drastically reduced"
3559.100,3560.000," into constant we can"
3560.500,3562.500," and we can become much more aware of"
3563.300,3565.100," those processes and how they operate"
3566.800,3566.900," so"
3567.700,3569.200," number one suffering"
3570.100,3574.000," and cost death is part of past right now that not only"
3574.400,3576.500," do we suffer at the thought of our own and"
3577.600,3579.100," commonly not so always"
3579.900,3581.300," we also definitely suffer"
3582.100,3583.500," the loss of loved ones"
3584.800,3588.000," and you know and many other forms of suffering too but"
3589.600,3590.200," death is there"
3591.200,3591.300," that's"
3592.700,3594.600," back to number one I wanted to draw our attention to"
3595.400,3596.500," back to number two"
3599.700,3600.600," I don't think I've spoken"
3601.200,3601.800," clearly to"
3602.400,3602.600," so far"
3604.000,3605.200," is that"
3605.500,3605.800," what"
3607.700,3612.800," what the what all this practice is pointing to what the awakening the word is"
3613.100,3613.800," pointing to"
3615.300,3616.400," is real"
3617.900,3619.100," it's not like"
3619.900,3621.400," hey if you do this practice enough"
3622.100,3624.600," you can engineer these great states of mind"
3626.500,3626.800," it's not"
3628.100,3629.100," it's real"
3630.300,3631.700," it's not an engineering feat"
3632.500,3634.000," it's not something we can struct"
3634.900,3636.900," it's actually seeing more"
3637.700,3638.000," clearly"
3639.300,3639.500," it's"
3640.100,3641.100," encountering"
3642.500,3645.400," a Dimension of experience"
3646.400,3651.600," and it's very difficult languages is difficult here because we don't have language for it but"
3652.200,3656.900," let me just say it like that for now it's encountering a Dimension of experience that is"
3657.500,3658.300," real"
3659.800,3660.600," and in fact"
3661.400,3661.700," is"
3662.300,3662.600," more"
3663.600,3663.900," real"
3664.600,3665.500," than the"
3666.300,3668.100," way we normally experience"
3668.700,3668.900," our"
3669.400,3669.800," reality"
3670.500,3672.200," if we say reality you know is"
3672.700,3675.800," whenever is a rising I'm seeing a cup in front of me this is real"
3676.700,3678.400," because it's because it's experience"
3678.900,3679.400," that's true"
3680.600,3684.200," but actually it doesn't mean it's kind of the end of the story that actually"
3685.800,3686.700," it's possible"
3687.600,3687.800," to"
3688.900,3690.000," experience"
3691.000,3691.400," the fact that"
3692.400,3693.500," both my sense of me"
3694.200,3696.100," and my experience of this cup"
3697.200,3698.200," are actually"
3699.400,3700.100," part of"
3700.700,3701.600," a larger"
3702.400,3703.000," experience"
3703.900,3705.400," which encompasses both of them"
3707.200,3711.100," and in that sense it's like both me and the cup"
3711.600,3712.500," are Appearances"
3713.000,3713.500," within"
3714.000,3714.700," something large"
3716.800,3716.900," now"
3717.900,3719.800," that's that one that would be"
3720.500,3722.600," when when we see that typically"
3723.200,3727.000," we might call it an experience of oneness with over unity that there's a"
3727.500,3730.900," and sometimes there's it's very clear that what what unifies"
3731.500,3734.900," everything is a one single hole is a awareness there's an awareness that"
3735.300,3737.100," includes all experience and"
3737.500,3739.600," and who we are and whoever else is we're all"
3740.100,3741.800," in one Great awareness"
3742.600,3742.600," so"
3743.300,3744.700," fair enough okay possibly"
3745.200,3748.200," but actually we can also see further than that that"
3748.700,3751.000," that the very Appearances themselves"
3751.600,3752.100," are actually"
3752.600,3753.900," in this famous Buddhist term"
3754.500,3755.000," empty"
3755.500,3756.000," meaning"
3756.400,3759.500," they are made a constituent parts pixels or"
3760.200,3762.400," dust modes or something we don't exactly know what"
3763.000,3764.700," and that we can see that there"
3765.200,3766.200," they're simply not"
3768.800,3769.500," as sort of"
3771.400,3773.300," present the way we think they are"
3773.900,3775.700," it's a bit like discovering that"
3776.400,3777.800," we've been watching a movie"
3778.500,3779.100," and first of all"
3779.800,3784.100," we could say on the first level is amazing to realise it's all being is it all is a kind of move"
3784.700,3785.600," that alone is"
3786.700,3790.700," a flavour of Awakening again that would be under the category of Wonders because we"
3791.400,3795.800," see everything's kind of included in this one sort of dream or movie"
3796.200,3797.600," I've been calling my life"
3798.500,3799.100," you know and"
3799.500,3800.000," but you know"
3800.900,3803.200," assuming the movie analogy you can see that actually"
3803.900,3806.700," you know it's it's actually just a play of light"
3807.600,3808.400," you know know the"
3808.800,3811.600," the all this stuff that seems so real it's a kind of"
3812.300,3813.100," like a dream"
3813.700,3814.800," it's it's it's a"
3815.200,3816.900," it's a it's a it's a fantastic"
3818.900,3820.600," arcade word"
3821.100,3822.400," arcane and archa"
3822.700,3822.900," and"
3823.700,3827.300," it's a it's a it's a species of chimer"
3827.900,3828.600," you know and"
3829.100,3830.200," this again this"
3830.600,3833.000," coincides with some recent neuroscience that"
3833.400,3836.600," with with we we are brain sort of hallucinate the world"
3837.100,3845.500," and then sensory input corrects the hallucination you know we can I you know I'm fairly sure that in Awakening we get to see that process"
3846.200,3848.500," we get to see that it is a process that"
3848.900,3850.300," the way we've been experiencing the world"
3851.100,3852.600," actually is a kind of"
3853.200,3854.500," self-generated movie"
3855.300,3855.600," and the"
3856.200,3858.000," actually the movie is kind of made of"
3860.800,3861.900," in substantiality"
3864.600,3865.200," emptiness"
3866.300,3868.600," both itself and other self and world"
3870.100,3871.700," and that's more real now"
3872.300,3873.600," you know it would be"
3875.600,3881.000," the the goal I think in practice of I guess there is no call okay but"
3881.800,3885.800," the the the it's very easy to think that that kind of insight"
3886.300,3889.000," in a wow I've got it now that would be sort of the end of the road"
3889.900,3896.300," somehow I've seen the nature of reality and it's it's actually a it's actually a total garm nest"
3896.600,3897.700," there's a garden this"
3898.000,3900.500," be easy to think that that's sort of the end of the road"
3901.600,3902.900," but of course it's not"
3903.400,3904.200," um because"
3904.800,3906.500," the dream is happening"
3907.300,3907.900," you know and as"
3908.300,3912.200," you know yamada Cohen roshi great 20th century master said"
3913.100,3915.000," this may all be a dream"
3915.700,3917.200," but we must still work"
3917.800,3918.800," to make it a happier"
3919.200,3919.400," dream"
3920.600,3921.100," you know so that's"
3922.000,3923.800," that's actually a perfect expression"
3924.700,3925.400," of the sort of"
3926.100,3929.200," the the next phase of practice which is"
3929.900,3930.500," you know how"
3931.800,3935.100," how having discovered this oneness how having discovered this"
3935.700,3936.700," emptiness of all"
3937.200,3939.800," and and becoming less attached"
3940.500,3942.500," less Tangled Up In attachments"
3942.900,3946.000," less identified less fixated as a sense of a person"
3948.500,3949.400," why do we do next"
3950.300,3953.500," well how can we work to make a happier dream"
3954.200,3955.200," you know is is"
3955.700,3956.900," a great way of putting it"
3957.400,3958.800," and there's a there's another point"
3959.500,3960.900," in here as well which is the"
3964.300,3966.500," I don't know quite had to put this but um"
3969.200,3970.000," assembly like this"
3971.500,3973.300," we don't want to then get attached"
3973.700,3973.700," to"
3974.400,3975.300," I think seen"
3976.600,3977.400," it's all gone"
3979.300,3981.100," there's nothing to get attached to there"
3983.400,3984.500," that'll sneak back in"
3985.200,3985.900," now I've got it"
3986.500,3987.200," now I've seen it"
3989.700,3990.300," that's actually"
3991.500,3993.900," the recoiling of a self"
3994.600,3996.100," and the recoiling"
3996.700,3997.200," of a"
3997.500,4001.600," somewhat fixed view even if it's a slightly more accurate one"
4002.600,4004.600," but it's all a movie it's all gone"
4007.500,4008.600," nothing is"
4012.300,4012.800," fixable"
4014.000,4015.800," nothing is fixable not even"
4016.300,4016.600," nothing"
4017.300,4017.800," okay"
4018.900,4019.600," do you see what I mean"
4022.700,4025.000," okay um so that's factored too"
4025.400,4025.900," it's really"
4026.800,4030.000," and then Factor 3 I mean maybe this is a bit obvious"
4030.500,4030.600," but"
4032.300,4032.400," I mean"
4033.800,4034.000," actually"
4036.700,4038.600," practice is a factor"
4039.400,4040.300," the fact that we"
4040.900,4042.500," sit down and become still"
4042.900,4043.600," and quiet"
4043.900,4044.500," for a bit"
4044.700,4045.300," every day"
4045.900,4047.200," does seem to"
4052.900,4053.500," hurt"
4055.400,4057.000," you are lives ourselves"
4057.300,4058.100," our experience"
4058.500,4059.300," in interesting"
4060.200,4060.600," helpful"
4061.600,4062.100," Waze"
4063.000,4063.200," that"
4064.900,4065.400," may"
4065.700,4067.800," among other things catalyze"
4070.200,4072.500," flash's experiences glimpses"
4073.300,4073.600," of"
4074.400,4075.800," this all being a movie"
4089.900,4090.700," Imagine that"
4091.400,4092.800," your private movie"
4096.600,4098.100," you know you're allowed to come back"
4098.500,4099.700," to your own experience"
4100.800,4101.400," to your own"
4102.800,4103.600," experience"
4104.600,4105.200," they're allowed to"
4108.500,4109.800," there's a slight there's a home"
4111.100,4114.200," there's a home base that is yours and yours alone"
4118.200,4119.400," that's really kind of"
4120.700,4122.800," you know where you personally"
4123.800,4124.900," son of belong"
4127.700,4129.900," you know nobody else can"
4131.200,4131.800," can can"
4132.400,4132.900," actually"
4135.100,4136.100," sort of get you there"
4136.600,4137.500," in a nobody else"
4138.300,4140.800," can actually evict you from that seat"
4141.900,4142.000," I mean"
4142.800,4143.800," in a sense probably"
4144.700,4146.300," they can because we can get"
4147.200,4147.500," you know"
4148.100,4150.200," a dirt of lava as a child or"
4151.000,4151.100," you know"
4152.500,4155.700," a need for outside approval or whatever"
4156.400,4157.500," factors will"
4158.000,4158.600," you know maybe"
4159.400,4161.000," make us adaptive"
4161.600,4162.600," personalities and"
4163.400,4164.800," kind of take us out of our"
4165.400,4166.100," own sort of"
4166.900,4169.300," thrown in in our own life"
4169.800,4170.300," so to speak"
4171.800,4173.300," maybe this is slightly weird language but"
4173.800,4174.300," bear with me"
4174.900,4174.900," you know"
4175.400,4176.800," perhaps that's kind of true"
4177.300,4177.900," but in the end"
4179.100,4180.500," only you can can"
4181.400,4183.200," inhabit the heart of your own life"
4184.100,4185.800," and in doing that"
4186.800,4189.900," it might involve actually a kind of releasing"
4190.900,4194.200," of of the sense of who you thought you were"
4195.800,4196.400," you know that"
4197.900,4199.800," there's actually you know ah you"
4200.500,4201.500," that knows how to"
4202.300,4203.600," live in the middle of your life"
4205.000,4206.100," and appreciate that"
4207.200,4209.100," you'll being given this life"
4210.500,4211.400," and it's yours"
4215.600,4216.400," and practice"
4217.500,4218.500," is one way"
4220.600,4224.200," being still being quiet on a daily basis for portion of time"
4226.200,4228.700," does seem to be one way of coming back to that"
4230.700,4233.100," imperfectly not infallibly"
4236.600,4237.200," but it seems to"
4238.900,4242.100," um okay let me just have a quick look at my my notes here"
4242.500,4242.600," and"
4248.600,4250.400," yeah okay I'm going to read a bit from the book now"
4251.100,4252.000," because this is um"
4253.700,4255.700," this is a time when"
4257.100,4260.600," the book has has a lot of different things in it but it including"
4261.300,4262.700," little sort of stories from"
4264.000,4266.600," students lives and here and they're from my own life"
4267.100,4270.300," and I've put my life in practice basically and this is"
4270.800,4274.500," a bit about going to Mount Athos which is this"
4275.200,4277.500," Peninsula northern Greece dedicated to the"
4278.200,4280.600," monastic life of the Orthodox church that's been a"
4281.300,4282.400," practice community"
4283.400,4285.000," but at least 1500 years"
4286.000,4286.200," and"
4287.700,4293.100," and I was taken there with a little group led by an icon painter called Aiden Hart"
4293.500,4295.500," Who at that time was a monk and novice monk"
4296.300,4300.900," and since become quite renowned as an icon painter he actually painted the"
4301.800,4304.200," kind of screen within which"
4305.200,4309.600," the new English king King Charles was cut was crowned"
4309.900,4311.400," in Westminster Abbey during his"
4311.800,4313.000," coronation ceremony"
4313.400,4317.100," so he's he's a he was a marvelous guy she's Aiden heart"
4317.400,4318.000," but he had a"
4318.700,4321.400," spiritual father when I put on Mount Athos and"
4322.000,4325.100," he took he took us to meet that guy was the Abbot of a monastery"
4325.700,4326.600," the Old ab"
4326.900,4328.400," had a long silver beard"
4328.700,4331.700," and there was a stillness about him a deep quiet"
4332.200,4334.200," apart from his long hair and beard"
4334.600,4337.300," and the gold ornaments that adorned his black robes"
4337.900,4340.400," he reminded me of some zen Masters I had met"
4341.100,4343.400," the dark shining clarity of his eyes"
4343.900,4345.700," and his calm capacious"
4346.300,4346.800," presence"
4347.500,4348.200," by the way I was"
4349.200,4351.400," somewhat young man at this time mid- 30s"
4352.100,4355.100," we met in a large room overlooking the Aegean Sea"
4355.700,4359.500," the Monastery had been built into a cliff some 1400 years earlier"
4360.000,4361.000," in his oldest parts"
4361.800,4364.800," this ancient rafted rum had been resting here"
4365.400,4366.500," high above the sea"
4366.900,4369.300," filled with holy practice ever since"
4369.900,4370.900," it was a lovely place"
4371.700,4372.600," not austere"
4373.100,4375.900," because although plain it's Shawn"
4376.300,4378.600," with the gold frames of icons on the walls"
4378.900,4382.100," and the air was rich with candle wax and incense"
4383.100,4386.100," the abs spoke to us in his excellent careful French"
4386.700,4387.300," at one point"
4387.800,4388.800," our guide Aiden"
4389.300,4391.600," encouraged me to share something about Zen"
4391.800,4392.700," and meditation"
4393.100,4396.100," hoping to get a conversation going about parallel parts"
4396.600,4397.900," of spiritual development"
4398.700,4400.500," after all here were two traditions"
4401.000,4402.300," Orthodox monasticism"
4402.700,4403.400," and Zen"
4404.100,4409.100," that believed in training the human mind in order to discover something like a loving reality"
4409.800,4410.600," at its core"
4411.500,4414.900," all by the man's presence I found myself tongue tied"
4415.600,4419.700," able to offer only a few garbled mega sentences about Zen"
4420.500,4422.400," the Abbott listened and paused"
4423.500,4425.600," then he said that zen was too foreign"
4426.200,4428.200," it was like a long narrow Bridge"
4428.900,4431.100," when a shot came the bridge would fall"
4432.700,4433.000," I was"
4433.800,4435.600," quite young in practice then"
4436.500,4437.900," maybe early 30s I think"
4438.700,4441.400," and I felt both shy and offended"
4442.200,4443.000," I kept quiet"
4443.500,4444.700," and didn't tell him what I thought"
4445.500,4447.600," which was that far from being a long Bridge"
4448.200,4451.700," zen zen was the shortest distance to my own heart"
4452.500,4455.500," there was no more direct shortcut to Human Nature"
4456.000,4456.700," man xen"
4457.200,4457.500," for me"
4458.000,4461.100," it had none of the elaborate bridge work of Christianity"
4461.700,4463.900," with its fantastic rights and stories"
4464.400,4465.600," then by contrast"
4466.000,4467.800," simply brought us back to who we were"
4468.300,4469.900," as we were again and again"
4470.400,4471.300," warts and all"
4471.900,4474.000," I felt rattled and chagrined"
4474.300,4475.700," by the Abbotts repost"
4476.200,4479.200," in a particular way that perhaps only a young person"
4479.700,4481.200," distrustful of authority"
4481.700,4482.300," can be"
4483.400,4483.600," yet"
4484.100,4484.600," paradoxically"
4485.400,4486.500," in the way of Zen"
4487.200,4489.900," throughout the next year it was the Abbots rebuttal"
4490.500,4493.000," that made me determined to rededicate myself"
4493.400,4495.500," to my then flagging zen training"
4496.300,4499.300," and drove me fat to find my first Tuesday teacher"
4500.100,4500.800," and that came about"
4501.200,4502.800," because of what he taught about next"
4503.700,4508.400," under Aiden's prompting the Abbot told us about a time some decades back"
4509.500,4510.700," when he had been coming home"
4511.400,4512.100," to ASOS"
4512.400,4513.300," on the local ferry"
4515.000,4516.200," it was the end of the afternoon"
4517.100,4521.000," and the late light before sunset was turning the mountain of Athos"
4521.700,4523.300," on which is monastery Stan's"
4524.000,4525.600," into a glowing eminence"
4526.300,4528.500," he gazed at it from the rail of the boat"
4529.100,4529.900," fascinated"
4530.600,4531.700," and before his eyes"
4532.200,4534.300," it dissolved into golden light"
4535.000,4537.500," like a loaf of bread crumbling into dust"
4539.000,4539.800," at the same time"
4540.500,4542.700," everything else crumbled too"
4543.400,4544.900," and became the same light"
4545.700,4547.900," that was when he saw the face of God"
4548.400,4548.800," he said"
4549.800,4551.200," it was as if all this world"
4551.700,4553.400," had been the very bread of God"
4554.200,4555.300," and broke apart"
4555.900,4557.900," to reveal the godhead itself"
4559.600,4562.500," from then on he hadn't doubted that God is in all things"
4563.600,4565.200," it was only our fallen nature"
4565.900,4567.300," that prevented our seeing this"
4568.100,4569.100," therefore we trained"
4569.800,4572.100," in order to recognise that face everywhere"
4573.500,4575.100," I was astonished to hear this"
4575.800,4577.200," remove the name god"
4577.900,4578.600," and it sounded"
4579.300,4580.500," like xan Awakening"
4581.400,4582.600," his story encouragement"
4583.500,4587.100," if these Orthodox monks could discover something so similar"
4588.000,4589.200," who cared what we call it"
4590.000,4590.300," God"
4591.000,4591.600," emptiness"
4592.100,4592.800," but in nature"
4593.300,4594.200," original face"
4595.100,4596.000," what did it really matter"
4597.000,4597.800," in all cases"
4598.800,4601.400," it allowed us to see what we and this world"
4601.800,4602.600," really are"
4603.300,4604.500," and original nature"
4605.100,4606.600," without space or time"
4607.300,4608.600," intrinsically loving"
4609.500,4611.000," against the reality of that"
4611.700,4612.600," who car"
4612.900,4614.000," what name it was given"
4614.900,4615.600," any name"
4616.200,4617.000," was chaff"
4617.600,4618.400," in the wind"
4620.100,4620.700," but there was more"
4621.800,4624.600," it wasn't just about names there was something way better"
4625.200,4625.600," going on"
4626.500,4628.600," across cultures and epochs"
4629.200,4631.800," people had been-- stumbling upon this great discovery"
4632.500,4633.600," of our deepest nature"
4634.300,4635.200," it was wonderful"
4635.700,4637.700," that a devout Orthodox patriarch"
4638.200,4641.500," could find the Marvel of unitary emptiness prevailing all things"
4642.400,4644.400," the dissolution of the Fabric of our world"
4644.900,4648.400," a delicious a dissolution that implicates us entirely"
4649.000,4650.900," and shows us our inseparability"
4652.600,4654.800," from the hole experience we call the world"
4655.400,4656.200," it was wonderful"
4656.700,4658.300," that this Dimension of our reality"
4658.900,4660.800," have been showing itself in India"
4661.200,4662.200," China Japan"
4662.600,4663.100," America"
4663.600,4664.500," the rhineland"
4664.900,4665.600," East Anglia"
4666.100,4666.700," castile"
4667.300,4668.200," and Greece"
4668.700,4669.600," over the centuries"
4670.200,4670.900," and millennia"
4671.600,4672.200," what a gift"
4672.700,4674.900," that we humans could make this Discovery"
4675.500,4676.900," that was way more important"
4677.800,4678.400," than the names"
4679.100,4680.300," we have applied"
4680.900,4681.200," to it"
4687.000,4688.200,"is a cross cult"
4688.800,4689.400," reality"
4689.900,4691.500," is a trans cultural"
4692.000,4692.600," reality"
4693.100,4694.400," as a sort of Trance"
4694.900,4695.700," sapiens"
4696.500,4697.000," reality"
4704.200,4705.200," yeah I think that's"
4707.000,4708.100," I know that sort of a ringing"
4709.600,4712.100," way to sort of end this little aspiration of"
4712.700,4713.600," three sessions on"
4714.300,4714.900," on them"
4717.000,4719.800," Awakening and it's factors and the role of doing"
4720.400,4721.500," and their own land doing"
4722.600,4723.400," because say the role of"
4724.200,4724.800," practicing"
4725.500,4728.000," practices are doing"
4728.500,4729.900," but also practice as"
4730.900,4731.900," a non-dairy"
4736.500,4737.100," non doing"
4737.600,4738.300," non-resisting"
4741.500,4742.500," non clinging"
4743.900,4744.800," non grasping"
4747.700,4748.300," allowing"
4749.800,4749.900," so"
4750.800,4751.200," um"
4753.800,4756.500," yeah I think I'll stop that actually let's um"
4757.600,4761.300," let's see let's go into discussion / Q&A"
4765.200,4766.700," I'm having a quick look in the"
4767.500,4770.100," in the chat but feel free to raise a hand"
4771.200,4772.300," and I'll do my best to"
4772.800,4774.200," respond in a helpful way"
4774.700,4775.900," or put something in the chat"
4777.500,4778.800," by way of questions"
4781.000,4782.100," also sort of sharing"
4782.800,4783.000," if you want"
4784.400,4785.900," the Year Carla hi"
4786.800,4787.900," can you unmute"
4791.800,4792.800," hi"
4793.700,4794.200," can you hear me"
4795.000,4795.500," yeah hi"
4797.300,4797.700," guys to see"
4798.900,4800.900," nice to see you I am"
4802.600,4804.400," have so many things exploding"
4804.900,4805.200," in my"
4806.200,4807.300," mind in a very good way"
4808.800,4810.300," it's kind of emotional"
4811.100,4811.900," I am"
4813.500,4814.300," I I just wanted to"
4815.500,4815.800," get your"
4818.300,4818.600," and you know"
4818.900,4821.900," your thoughts or your read on and experience I had"
4823.000,4823.500," um"
4824.600,4825.700," yesterday um"
4826.900,4829.900," my my partner and I are listening to your book"
4832.400,4833.200," on Audible and"
4835.600,4835.900," we were"
4837.900,4842.800," it's it's so beautiful thank you so much for that book it is there's such"
4843.900,4845.500," teaching and encouragement"
4847.000,4848.600," and possibility"
4849.000,4852.000," that's so you really make it so available"
4855.500,4855.900," but we were"
4858.100,4861.100," listening to the to chapter two"
4862.800,4864.300," The hindrances"
4865.000,4865.100," and"
4867.300,4869.100," the it's just"
4870.100,4873.500," really helpful guidance that you give and"
4875.700,4882.500," in the middle of listening to this I know this that gaze down at where we were sitting and"
4884.300,4885.800," and I had this shot of annoyance"
4886.400,4887.600," sounds really silly but"
4888.700,4890.200," you know there's like a rug that was"
4891.400,4892.800," you know tilted"
4893.200,4896.400," and there's a coffee table and it was sort of tilted the other way"
4897.400,4897.700," and"
4899.200,4902.400," and it was casting Shadows it just looked all"
4902.800,4905.300," it just looked messy it it looked"
4905.700,4908.100," you know you know disarranged"
4908.900,4909.400," and I thought"
4910.000,4911.900," I don't want to be annoyed"
4912.300,4912.900," right now"
4913.500,4914.400," this is a wonderful"
4915.000,4916.000," place listening"
4916.600,4917.500," to the book and"
4920.800,4923.100," and so I just listened to what you"
4923.800,4924.200," said"
4925.600,4926.800," and I thought"
4927.600,4929.400," what if I weren't annoyed"
4930.500,4933.000," buy that feeling like it had to change"
4934.800,4934.900," and"
4937.500,4940.500," and then I opened my eyes again and I looked down"
4941.300,4941.400," and"
4944.200,4944.800," it looked"
4945.300,4949.000," I looked at these angles in shadows and things and I thought"
4951.400,4952.500," well it's it's kind of"
4955.100,4958.700," it's it's kind of appealing it's they're something attractive about that it's"
4960.300,4960.800," it's it's"
4962.200,4963.300," just it's it's it's it's own"
4964.500,4967.200," and then you had said something about Picasso and I"
4968.000,4968.300," I"
4968.700,4970.400," looked at it again"
4971.300,4972.300," and it just became"
4973.400,4976.200," sounds so crazy like you said words don't really"
4977.400,4985.000," often nail it down but it became beautiful I mean it just became beautiful like someone had painted"
4985.700,4986.400," this perfect"
4987.500,4988.800," misalignment of"
4990.300,4992.800," angles and shadows into its own"
4994.000,4994.600," unique"
4995.800,4996.500," perfection"
4998.300,4998.600," and I"
5000.900,5001.300," I thought"
5002.200,5006.400," I'd say I thought for a minute okay I don't I don't I want to make sure I'm not engineering this"
5007.700,5008.500," and I"
5011.400,5013.700," and I just sat for a second and I felt that"
5014.200,5015.000," solar plex"
5016.100,5017.200," kind of tension"
5018.500,5019.900," just dissolved just"
5020.400,5020.900," lift"
5023.100,5023.300," just"
5027.400,5029.800," it left piece but I'm going to say you left joy"
5032.000,5033.100," you know with my"
5033.800,5038.400," crooked rug and coffee table and The Shadows in the light and the"
5041.300,5041.600,"um and"
5042.100,5043.200," I it's like"
5043.600,5044.700," that I wanted"
5045.100,5049.100," to do something with this I want to I know I don't don't do anything with it"
5049.800,5053.000," you know I have two I'll just say I have two posts on the"
5053.900,5056.100," rim of my screen and"
5057.000,5060.200," one says daily meditation is not optional"
5061.200,5066.000," and the other one says meditation asks nothing of Us"
5067.900,5068.600," and they look"
5069.200,5072.200," and and I and I put them up there and I said I know I have"
5073.300,5076.800," a little sense of sort of opposition between these two things"
5077.500,5078.600," but I want to I want to"
5079.400,5080.200," see if I can"
5081.300,5081.500," you know"
5082.300,5082.600," make"
5083.400,5085.200," feel harmonious with them because I know"
5085.900,5086.900," they belong to together"
5088.500,5088.600," and"
5089.500,5091.600," and it's it felt a little bit like"
5093.100,5094.300," like in that place"
5097.000,5097.200," where I"
5097.800,5098.000," I"
5099.500,5099.700," first"
5100.300,5103.200," I thought about allowing and then I think where I got to was"
5105.400,5106.800," allowed disallowing"
5108.400,5109.600," and and then it just"
5110.700,5112.000," became perfect"
5119.600,5125.700," yeah so now I'm looking at Daily meditation is not optional and meditation asks nothing of us not as"
5128.200,5131.200," things that don't have to be in opposition"
5131.900,5133.100," but that are the same"
5139.500,5140.800," that's absolutely beautiful"
5141.600,5145.200," thank you so much for sharing all of that car I you know it's"
5145.900,5148.800," I think it just speaks for itself it's just speaks for it's not"
5149.100,5152.100," you know thank you so much I hope it came out in you know English"
5152.900,5158.000," okay with beautifully beautifully so landed very definitely with me and I imagine with everybody here"
5158.500,5159.400," that's absolutely beautiful"
5160.200,5161.300," thank you Henry"
5161.800,5162.500," thank you so much"
5165.200,5165.600," thank you"
5166.700,5167.000," oh"
5167.800,5168.100," wow"
5172.600,5173.000," okay"
5174.100,5174.500," Stephen"
5177.000,5179.400," hey Sarah I'm wondering can we um"
5180.500,5180.800," can"
5181.700,5183.100," people speaking B sort of"
5184.600,5185.400," I don't want to say like"
5186.100,5186.400," I don't know"
5186.800,5189.800," up on the main screen next to me kind of thing or what"
5190.200,5192.400," it's Anna if that's a hassle don't worry but"
5193.500,5196.400," if it's easily done anyway Stephen why don't you start ah there we go"
5196.900,5197.100," hi"
5197.700,5198.200," Stephen hi"
5199.200,5204.100," I switched to multi-speaker view so that everybodies speaking is is up on them but that works too"
5204.700,5210.400," hi Henry thank you for your time and for all of your offerings the book everything you've put out"
5211.100,5218.000," I'm getting a lot of value from myself I am relatively new in my meditation journey maybe two or three years of"
5218.900,5220.100," semi consistent practice"
5220.900,5228.100," and I'm gearing up for and putting my sights on down in the Horizon no huge rush my first"
5229.100,5230.300," multiple day retreat"
5231.200,5233.000," and I'm wondering if you have"
5233.800,5236.600," considerations for somebody who is"
5237.100,5240.100," looking towards their first meditation Retreat what you might"
5241.000,5241.900," think about one"
5242.500,5244.400," thing that sort of arising as a"
5244.900,5247.200," first question I guess is like is there a best"
5247.700,5249.700," seasoned to do a retreat in"
5250.300,5252.100," I'm not sure if that sounds trivial but like"
5253.200,5255.600," is winter better than summer is fall in spring like"
5256.100,5260.200," what sort of considerations would you have for somebody who's looking forward to their first"
5260.700,5262.900," multiple date 10-day retreat"
5263.200,5270.100," I'm looking at dama.org for their vapas retreats on Victoria or in Vancouver Island but specifically but"
5271.000,5272.500," just anything that you think would be worth"
5273.100,5274.500," contemplating in that"
5275.100,5275.400," sense"
5276.600,5278.300," we'll have you done a weekend retreat"
5279.100,5279.300," No"
5280.200,5281.100," I would do that first"
5281.700,5289.900," I've done I did the virtual Retreat that Sam Harris offered on The Waking Up app we went to toino it was a lovely experience we treated it as a"
5290.400,5290.700," as a"
5291.300,5292.700," obviously a remote"
5293.200,5299.000," Retreat by going somewhere separate from ourself we rented an airbnb and did the virtual Retreat as its own"
5299.300,5300.200," in a separate space"
5300.800,5303.800," so sort of not with anybody else but"
5305.200,5305.400," yeah"
5305.800,5306.000," I mean"
5307.700,5309.300," the obvious thing would be to do a sort of"
5309.800,5311.400," there is an intermediate step"
5311.800,5312.100," which is"
5312.600,5314.400," a shorter in person retreat"
5315.500,5316.100," two or three days"
5317.000,5319.900," um and I would I would encourage that"
5320.800,5321.700," I know it's not"
5322.400,5326.000," necessary I known many people who their first which she was a multi day"
5326.900,5328.500," but I just think it's wiser"
5329.400,5331.500," because you're you know it's it it"
5332.500,5334.700," I mean there's no particular reason to be sort of"
5335.700,5338.200," afraid that anything will sort of go horribly wrong or something"
5338.700,5341.700," it can do if you load it up with too much pressure"
5342.400,5345.500," I mean Tim Ferris has a story about going to attend a retreat"
5346.100,5349.200," and also who is microdosing mushrooms and also who is fasting"
5349.800,5351.300," and he kind of went right off the rails"
5351.800,5355.400," um but you know it wasn't wise to load it up like that with those other things"
5356.100,5357.500," you want to just be taking care of yourself"
5358.000,5358.500," but I would"
5359.000,5362.000," I would always say if it's possible to do a shorter one first"
5362.900,5365.900," you can do worse than just doing a three-day or a two-day"
5366.500,5366.600," you know"
5367.200,5367.500," first"
5368.200,5368.600," it's just"
5369.400,5370.700," it's just a sensible"
5371.400,5372.400," intermediate step"
5373.300,5374.500," but I'm happy to hear that you're"
5375.000,5376.900," you're thinking of doing that is a great"
5377.600,5379.700," it's a little bit of a milestone for sure I'm sure"
5380.500,5382.300," but consider doing a shorter one first"
5383.500,5383.700," definitely"
5384.200,5384.500," thank you"
5385.300,5385.500," thank you"
5387.100,5388.700," thanks a lot cast and howdy"
5395.800,5397.700," I think you need to earn yeah"
5398.200,5401.800," I think now hey good to see you and good to see everyone"
5402.200,5402.500," thank you"
5403.500,5404.300," I love these"
5405.300,5406.900," short retreats with you every time"
5408.700,5413.800," so I thought I'd check in I had a very very lovely experience today again in meditation"
5414.700,5418.000," and recently I guess it's recently but I have more and more"
5419.700,5423.800," seemingly random memories come up and meditation while you're guiding me"
5424.600,5427.400," all of a sudden I remember something from 10 20 years ago"
5428.500,5428.900," that"
5429.900,5431.600," maybe maybe haven't processed or"
5432.400,5436.500," but it seems that they're not so random but they are actually very significant"
5437.500,5439.400," memories and and then"
5440.200,5443.200," they bring me into the heart and then feelings come up and I"
5443.800,5444.900," so I see kind of a"
5445.300,5447.600," almost like a therapeutic process take place"
5448.600,5450.000," and at the same time"
5451.600,5452.200," that maybe"
5453.200,5453.600," may not be"
5454.400,5458.400," connected at first to to Awakening or something deeper like that"
5459.200,5461.500," but then it on the other hand it does feel like"
5462.300,5463.100," there's a connection"
5463.600,5464.100," to that"
5464.600,5466.100," as well there is more there is an"
5467.100,5468.000," a Dimension of"
5469.400,5472.000," of something deeper or there is a Dimension of"
5473.100,5474.200," everything well"
5475.300,5477.900," I I've you know so there's a Dimension of"
5482.000,5485.900," I I cannot really explain it's very difficult to talk about it"
5487.500,5489.500," but there's a very beautiful deep dimension"
5490.300,5492.200," of there's nothing to be done with these"
5493.200,5495.300," with these memories"
5496.100,5498.100," I love as they come up"
5499.700,5503.100," but I want to ask you do you you know in your in your experience"
5505.600,5506.000," have you been"
5506.800,5511.200," yeah have you is that kind of a phase that that I might be going"
5512.000,5512.100," through"
5512.900,5514.700," and maybe"
5515.400,5516.000," is is it"
5517.300,5521.900," I I guess my my way of dealing with it is just taking it as it comes and"
5522.500,5525.000," to see what happens but maybe you have some kind of"
5525.600,5527.800," advise or some experience that you've had with"
5528.600,5530.100," those memories showing up and maybe"
5532.400,5533.300," yeah bringing us deeper"
5534.500,5537.500," that's beautiful thank you so much for sharing that cost and um"
5538.200,5541.300," I do have things to say on it let's see if any of this is helpful"
5541.900,5542.800," I mean first of all"
5543.900,5548.400," in one cents you know what we're Awakened to in a way"
5550.600,5550.900," is"
5551.600,5552.200," already"
5553.300,5553.800," healed"
5554.200,5555.800," it never wasn't healed"
5557.600,5563.100," but I am a firm Believer as you know in this two rut track"
5563.600,5565.100," that we human beings"
5565.600,5565.900," I think"
5566.400,5568.500," probably pretty much all of us have"
5569.000,5569.400," healing"
5570.100,5570.400," to do"
5571.200,5571.900," and I think"
5572.500,5573.100," Awakening"
5573.900,5575.100," and not only awaken"
5575.700,5576.600," the awareness"
5577.300,5581.500," that we start to access more frequently more fully"
5582.200,5582.900," through practice"
5584.100,5584.300," it"
5584.700,5587.900," is a loving kind of awareness and it wants"
5589.800,5592.500," two things it was everything to be included"
5594.300,5596.500," and it seems to kind of know if we've got"
5597.200,5597.900," you know in in"
5598.400,5601.400," internal family system language exiles"
5602.200,5603.200," it will want them"
5603.900,5605.000," to come out of exile"
5605.300,5610.900," I think but from the level of Awakening as well I think Awakening"
5611.900,5612.900," it just seems"
5614.100,5621.500," I mean I really I really don't know because you know the some traditions probably talk about this more than others and Zen doesn't particularly but I think it's"
5622.000,5625.000," it's it's it's it seems to seek healing"
5625.400,5625.900," you know it's like"
5626.200,5627.800," so I think it'll bring up"
5628.400,5629.400," what isn't healed"
5630.500,5632.100," and and what maybe that's"
5633.500,5637.100," in a way it's very similar to bringing up what isn't included"
5638.900,5641.400," you know there seems to be some sort of natural process of"
5642.100,5644.500," I don't know our consciousness becoming perhaps"
5645.900,5646.200," more"
5647.800,5648.400," aurous"
5648.900,5651.100," and permeable to our subconscious"
5651.900,5653.600," even our unconscious so"
5654.100,5655.400," we're just getting more"
5656.700,5659.300," you know like a sieve we can't keep things out"
5659.900,5661.800," you know or more perforated"
5662.500,5663.400," and I just think that's"
5664.400,5669.400," I would just say that what all and I can say really is that inclusivity"
5670.300,5673.800," you know seems to be part of the whole thing like just radical"
5674.900,5675.900," non-resisting"
5676.400,5677.300," non-resisting"
5678.100,5681.300," and so the learning those things come out in the feelings with them and just"
5682.400,5684.800," just you know just what happens if we don't"
5686.000,5686.700," resist them"
5688.000,5689.700," if the heart can really be open"
5691.300,5693.600," I'm pretty sure it's a growth process"
5694.100,5694.900," probably you know"
5695.400,5697.200," but I'm not a great expert but I think"
5697.900,5699.500," that I think you're doing the right thing"
5700.400,5701.500," I see there's a good thing"
5705.000,5708.100," yeah I yeah I mean I'm actually very interested in"
5709.100,5710.500," you know the the the"
5711.600,5712.500," relationship between"
5713.000,5713.500," trauma"
5714.400,5715.100," Awakening"
5715.500,5716.100," and healing"
5716.700,5717.500," I think there's something"
5719.500,5723.200," you know really important in there because I think you know if you just think about"
5724.800,5731.700," well I just think back to my own parents my dad grew up during the warm my first and second will woman Mum grew up during the Second World War"
5732.000,5733.900," she lost her mum in the Second World War"
5734.700,5734.900," and"
5735.900,5737.300," as a as a child and"
5737.900,5738.400," yeah she was"
5739.900,5742.400," I'm you know certainly traumatised as a kid"
5743.300,5743.500," and"
5744.600,5745.500," in a time when"
5746.400,5747.900," there wasn't space for trauma"
5748.900,5750.100," you know it was more"
5750.600,5751.500," you got to carry on"
5752.200,5753.800," has to get compartmentalized"
5754.300,5755.600," and then you've got PTSD"
5756.200,5756.500," and"
5756.800,5759.700," if that's just one little Family Story it must be"
5761.000,5761.700," pervasive"
5762.200,5763.400," because so many people"
5764.000,5767.300," had so many traumas that's not even considering the First World War"
5767.900,5770.300," when you know a whole Generations were wiped out and"
5770.900,5774.400," all that parental loss and all that family loss and you know"
5775.100,5775.900," had a chara"
5777.900,5778.800," a billion times"
5779.500,5779.600," you know"
5780.700,5784.700," a billion times and we haven't lived in a cult in cultures typically that a good"
5786.000,5788.000," understanding trauma and processing it"
5788.700,5788.800," so"
5790.200,5793.600," and yet you know we care so so I mean I wonder sometimes whether"
5795.400,5796.200," traumatised people"
5798.100,5799.400," sometimes it can be"
5800.100,5800.500," a Burr"
5801.800,5802.400," to Awakening"
5804.500,5807.700," but I think then The Awakening will want to process the trauma"
5808.500,5811.200," and I look at my own life story and I see it that way"
5812.100,5814.000," you know it's pretty traumatised myself and"
5814.400,5816.800," by Boom had an explosive Awakening of 19"
5817.400,5818.200," and a nowhere"
5818.700,5820.100," and what's the next thing that happens"
5820.800,5823.000," totally re-traumatized because"
5823.500,5826.600," actually they're waking in wanted that to be processed and released"
5827.000,5831.000," which took a hell of a long time and it's probably a never-ending process anyway maybe"
5831.500,5834.200," it's just a matter of getting less resistance to it"
5834.900,5836.900," you know and and we can you know somehow"
5837.400,5838.400," Can We Be Happy"
5838.800,5841.900," with a with a system that has still got trauma in"
5842.800,5844.600," it I think in a certain way the answer is yes"
5845.700,5846.100," actually"
5846.800,5847.300," you know and"
5848.200,5848.900," anyway"
5849.500,5852.400," so it's great great work thank you thank you Carson"
5852.900,5855.000," thanks Henry this super helpful thank"
5855.700,5857.000," okay Jacob hi"
5862.100,5863.400," oh hi can you hear me"
5864.000,5864.200," yeah"
5865.400,5869.900," I agree thank you so much for this as always I haven't maybe kind of"
5870.600,5872.600," unrelated question but when you were talking about"
5873.500,5877.800," the brain kind of like the simulation the you know watching a film it made me think"
5878.500,5880.800," so much about when I was really into lucid dreaming"
5881.400,5883.800," and my experiences with that and being in a dream and like"
5884.300,5884.800," you know touching"
5885.500,5890.700," the wall that I knew was in my mind was constructed in my mind and just having such a profound"
5891.500,5893.500," feeling of like what your brain can"
5894.100,5897.500," engineer for you but is there is there any way in which that has a"
5897.900,5899.300," that fits into"
5899.800,5904.400," zen in some way like dreams or lucid dreaming I know I've heard of like Tibet"
5904.800,5911.100," dream yoga but I was curious if there's any way that it kind of neatly or not fits into the Den as a framework"
5912.200,5923.200," you know I think I think you're right the basically the only what all that I know of and I haven't I haven't been trained in it at all is there's Tibetan lucid dreaming where they"
5923.900,5924.000," they"
5925.600,5929.900," I think it's a practice you can develop the capacity to sort of go lucid in your dreams"
5930.600,5931.000," um"
5931.800,5935.100," I would say I mean here's two things occur to me"
5935.500,5936.800," that a non Tibetan"
5937.400,5938.400," Buddhism one is"
5939.200,5944.100," it's a thing in zen you notice it in the biographies of all these Old Masters and"
5944.700,5946.800," and it's a hearing there in the comments actually"
5947.500,5948.800," that they take dreams"
5949.400,5951.200," sort of seriously you know"
5951.800,5955.100," if you know what I mean like there's there's a there's one master Who"
5956.500,5956.900," is called"
5957.500,5958.600," Judy Who"
5959.600,5965.600," were in a never he was in charge of some little shrine and he was but he was never Awakened and he felt bad about it"
5966.400,5969.800," and he he decided he was going to go off and train more"
5970.700,5972.200," to be more worthy of"
5972.600,5976.500," being in charge of this shrine you know and the night before he left he had a dream"
5977.100,5979.800," where the spirit of the local mountain where he lived"
5980.200,5981.200," came to him and said"
5981.700,5983.200," a great body sapra is coming here"
5984.000,5986.100," don't leave so he didn't leave when the next day"
5987.100,5990.000," you know an enlightened monk came by and"
5990.800,5992.000," boom Awakened"
5993.600,5994.100," Judy"
5994.800,5996.500," actually by Simply raising a finger"
5997.100,5999.500," is a famous story this one thing is then"
5999.900,6001.000," he's just lifted his finger"
6001.700,6004.300," and Judy boom suddenly I guess he saw that"
6004.600,6011.900," he was that finger that finger was the only thing in the universe that thing was the whole universe nothing was excluded in this little finger"
6012.500,6016.800," everything everything is alright here in this one finger"
6017.200,6018.500," you know that's hologram right"
6019.400,6022.600," a holographic view one little piece has everything"
6023.400,6025.700," you know indra's net I don't know you know so it"
6027.000,6027.900," that's an example of a"
6028.800,6029.100," they just"
6030.000,6031.100," seems to be"
6031.600,6033.600," a given that you take dreams seriously"
6034.500,6037.500," so sort of thing or they have some with them but I mean that's a rather different point"
6037.900,6038.700," then there's uhm"
6039.300,6039.700," you know the"
6040.400,6044.100," well in the punished as a vedic view is particularly"
6044.500,6045.900," clearly articulated in the"
6046.500,6048.500," I think it's the mandukya Shard"
6049.900,6051.900," where there is stated there's four"
6052.300,6052.700," consciousnesses"
6053.600,6055.200," there's there's waking"
6056.200,6056.900," dreaming"
6057.800,6058.500," deep sleep"
6059.300,6062.800," and then the circle to rear which means the force consciousness"
6064.100,6065.400," and the fourth consciousness"
6066.600,6066.900," is"
6067.800,6070.600," what the other three are actually made of"
6072.800,6073.300," waking"
6073.900,6074.400," dreaming"
6075.100,6075.600," deep sleep"
6076.100,6077.700," and the fourth consciousness"
6078.300,6079.800," has no characteristics"
6081.100,6082.300," it has no size"
6083.300,6086.300," it can't be seen tasted known in any way"
6086.900,6088.100," but everything is made of it"
6089.100,6090.700," and so in their view"
6091.100,6092.700," or in some way to views"
6093.200,6095.000," the path of practice is the path"
6095.700,6096.000," of"
6097.100,6099.400," discovering the quote career"
6101.400,6103.300," the size list space list timeless"
6105.100,6106.200," that's always here"
6107.100,6107.700," always right here"
6108.300,6109.600," and they're all this experience"
6110.300,6110.900," is made of"
6112.100,6116.400," so I don't know that's a I'm just there's no particularly good answer your question"
6116.900,6118.200," but it's so that's great"
6118.600,6119.200," yeah"
6120.300,6121.700," okay- thanks thank you"
6122.300,6122.600," great"
6123.100,6123.700," hi Dana"
6128.000,6128.600," hi Henry"
6129.300,6129.800," hi there"
6130.200,6130.900," hi I'm"
6131.600,6133.500," it's interesting I've been in your year course"
6133.900,6134.700," for over a year"
6135.800,6138.100," and I think the very first Sunday I did was"
6139.000,6141.800," based on the story of the woman that dropped her cane"
6142.600,6146.300," and the theme was a Rise abide and fall away"
6147.700,6148.000," and"
6149.500,6152.300," I remember asking you on that first session I ever joined"
6153.300,6157.400," hi related to the arise and abide but the fall away was alluding me"
6158.800,6161.200," and now that I'm a year plus into this"
6161.700,6165.200," and I have come to Santa Fe for the retreat in January and I practice"
6165.700,6166.500," with you daily"
6167.000,6167.800," in my home"
6169.400,6171.600," as we're doing the doing undoing theme"
6173.800,6178.500," I am relating it to the arise of I'd fall away like the following is the undoing"
6179.800,6180.700," and what's very interesting"
6181.700,6184.400," in terms of having practice now a year is that"
6186.400,6187.400," having practice"
6188.100,6191.000," I'm not challenged with the falling away anymore"
6191.900,6194.800," like it's very naturally integrated in to"
6195.900,6199.700," not just the practice but just daily life like a moment of just"
6200.500,6201.400," the uncle clinging"
6202.500,6206.000," the UN I think last year you said oh you're stuck in the attachment"
6207.600,6208.600," which is true and it's"
6209.700,6210.100," it's a"
6211.900,6214.700," it always strikes me in the moment of real"
6215.400,6215.900," life"
6217.200,6218.400," that I can just pivot"
6218.900,6219.200," now"
6220.700,6221.200," like quickly"
6222.300,6224.500," and it's been like organically evolving"
6225.100,6226.700," into just that letting go"
6227.300,6229.000," or maybe what you would say is undoing"
6229.700,6232.000," the concept seemed really really related to me"
6233.800,6234.900," so I just want to say that"
6236.000,6238.200," reflect back on a different"
6239.900,6241.900," story we addressed to a year ago and how"
6242.600,6244.600," they're all really in our woven these concepts"
6245.700,6247.700," that's absolutely beautiful I mean"
6248.300,6248.600," maybe"
6249.600,6253.300," maybe I 100% agree with you about the falling way"
6253.900,6255.100," I kind of undoing"
6255.300,6256.700," an intimately related"
6257.100,6257.900," I mean maybe"
6258.500,6261.200," I could sort of fine tune it a bit and say something like"
6262.000,6263.200," you know there's a there isn't"
6263.500,6266.700," absolutely sort of organic natural process which is"
6267.700,6269.100," it's an aspect of what"
6269.500,6273.100," of the natural law of all things that known as the Dharma"
6273.700,6275.700," that things arise abide"
6276.000,6276.900," and pass away"
6277.800,6279.500," and when we do our"
6280.400,6282.100," practice of undoing"
6282.600,6283.400," of releasing"
6283.900,6284.800," which we're joining that"
6285.700,6285.800," we're"
6286.500,6288.600," we're we're we're no longer resisting that"
6289.400,6294.900," we're letting that process just happen and you know and what what that process looks like in our experience"
6295.400,6296.800," is exactly our experience"
6297.700,6299.200," you know it is our experience we"
6299.500,6300.000," we are"
6300.500,6302.300," the Dharma experiencing itself"
6303.700,6303.700," so"
6304.500,6307.100," if we're ready to just release"
6309.000,6309.500," and not"
6310.100,6310.600," hold"
6311.100,6311.800," not cling"
6312.500,6313.400," and not resist"
6314.200,6316.500," you know then then we just see that what we are"
6317.600,6318.900," is the whole Dharma"
6319.200,6319.800," just doing"
6320.500,6323.100," it's process arise abide"
6323.800,6324.400," full of way"
6325.000,6328.500," so it's it is totally linked I I totally agree with you"
6329.100,6336.900," it's really beautiful I'm sorry if I said something a bit harsh like you're too attached or something either that sounds a bit sort of mean I did I try not"
6337.300,6343.500," it wasn't harsh it was it was just the language was interesting because I think it really resonated with"
6344.700,6344.700," me"
6344.900,6345.700," okay well that's good to hear"
6347.200,6347.900," I'm still here"
6349.300,6350.200," yes still here yes"
6351.000,6355.600," thank you for still being here that's great beautiful actually as a very very beautiful point"
6356.600,6357.000," really is"
6357.900,6358.800," and supporting because"
6359.400,6361.700," basically we don't want that process you know we"
6362.300,6363.900," we want things to stay"
6365.700,6366.800," so it's it's a real"
6368.100,6370.100," I mean it's a major growth thing"
6371.000,6371.200," yeah"
6371.800,6374.000," to let that be what happens"
6375.000,6376.400," you know those are a hole"
6377.300,6383.900," oh a whole natural I don't know ingrained wishes to keep things keep things keep things"
6386.200,6387.100," and it's a"
6387.400,6389.200," big deal to learn"
6391.300,6393.000," to let them go I mean"
6394.300,6397.200," it's it's a it's it that is a huge"
6398.100,6398.600," thing"
6400.800,6401.000," yeah"
6404.000,6405.000," yeah thank you for"
6406.000,6408.900," having these themes just reinforcing each other all the time"
6410.700,6411.900," that's the dhama you know"
6413.700,6415.400," thank you for bringing up Dana thank you"
6416.500,6420.100," okay- let's see maybe just one more possibly to let's see"
6420.700,6421.500," parent howdy"
6428.400,6428.900," hi Henry"
6429.300,6429.800," hi everybody"
6431.500,6431.700," and"
6432.800,6437.300," I have a question that I would like to ask but before that I just wanted to thank you for"
6438.300,6440.100," the meditation today"
6440.500,6440.800," and"
6441.700,6444.300," I don't really have words to describe it except and"
6444.700,6445.200," this is not"
6446.400,6446.800," and"
6447.500,6450.100," costing any thoughts upon it at all but"
6450.800,6453.000," it had a trouble factor for me"
6453.700,6456.400," I like very shortly into it I just find myself"
6456.800,6457.600," drilling slightly"
6458.600,6460.600," just dropped into it fallen away like that"
6461.600,6461.800," and"
6462.600,6463.500," so thank you for that"
6464.900,6466.100," in encouraging dribble"
6467.000,6467.100," and"
6468.200,6470.800," so what I wanted to"
6473.400,6473.700," just"
6474.100,6475.300," ask you about and"
6476.500,6476.600," so"
6479.200,6481.000," I think the concept of a line"
6481.800,6482.600," I first came across"
6483.300,6484.300," in this program"
6484.800,6487.800," probably about a year and a half ago so and it's been absolutely"
6489.100,6489.500," amazing"
6490.400,6491.500," it's still amazes me"
6496.000,6496.700," I find that"
6497.400,6498.900," in the allowing of"
6499.300,6501.700," various things inside me the hindrances and"
6504.000,6504.100," the"
6505.400,6510.900," allowing it in the small self to be welcoming the small self instead of trying to overcome it and"
6511.200,6512.100," back with it too"
6512.400,6513.200," transcend it"
6514.400,6514.700," there's"
6515.900,6516.800," I think maybe just"
6517.200,6518.000," a sense of"
6518.700,6519.600," the original love"
6520.600,6521.700," perhaps I'm getting it"
6522.600,6522.900," and"
6523.400,6525.900," it's a it's a definite felt sense of just"
6527.200,6527.800," a warm"
6528.100,6528.600," babbling"
6530.900,6531.800," overflowing"
6532.200,6533.800," liquid watery feeling"
6534.700,6538.800," probably a company by a rather kind of name grin I would imagine"
6539.700,6540.900," sometimes a"
6541.900,6547.100," almost a physical Like Falling away inside that that kind of tension inside almost"
6547.600,6551.700," sometimes I might feel that I might even be slumping but I don't think it's a physical thing at all but"
6553.900,6554.000," it's"
6555.000,6557.200," very very connected with just allowing"
6560.800,6561.300," allowing"
6562.300,6563.200," whatever is there just"
6563.500,6564.000," to be there"
6565.400,6568.000," and then in a way it feels like"
6568.800,6572.200," it's almost just imitating or coming into a harmonic wave with"
6573.000,6574.500," some greater aligned"
6574.800,6575.000," that"
6576.300,6577.200," that is a line"
6577.800,6580.000," you me as all to be here"
6580.600,6581.300," and expression"
6582.400,6582.900," of that"
6583.400,6583.700," and it's"
6584.200,6586.500," that is part of my practice is just to kind of be"
6587.600,6591.000," in that same harmonic way for that universal process"
6591.800,6593.700," and that is that's lovely it's wonderful but"
6595.100,6595.500," ah"
6596.000,6597.100," kind of wrestling about with"
6599.200,6600.500," you know that same allowing"
6601.000,6601.100," is"
6601.800,6603.300," is welcoming and allowing all"
6605.000,6612.600," all the stuff that's happening in the world I don't even need to name name them you know we all wear aware of the stuff that's going on amongst human beings and"
6613.400,6615.100," you have an in the animal kingdom"
6616.400,6620.400," this this one image is stuck with me I think it might be even been raised in one of these"
6624.300,6628.400," Nova of a large beast that's been brought down by a pack of predators"
6629.500,6631.700," and it's so big that it can actually live"
6632.700,6633.800," for a day or two"
6634.300,6634.600," through"
6636.900,6638.500," through being actually eaten alive"
6639.400,6640.200," I mean how"
6642.000,6642.600," how powerful"
6646.400,6646.700," and that"
6648.300,6654.200," that is allow that is allowing and I suppose you know it's maybe connecting up with what you're saying this morning as the"
6654.500,6655.300," first factors"
6656.700,6657.600," of worked in"
6658.000,6659.000," you know a suffering"
6661.600,6662.600," without a Dewey"
6663.200,6664.400," what do we would we have"
6665.100,6667.100," what would we search for suppose in a way but"
6668.300,6670.400," just feels as the allowing has also got"
6671.400,6671.800," allowing"
6672.500,6674.400," this beautiful original love but"
6675.400,6676.200," sometimes"
6676.600,6678.800," I get a feeling that it's it's a coldness there"
6679.700,6681.700," the coldness that also"
6682.800,6684.600," brings up a fear in me a fear of like"
6685.300,6688.300," my when I die am I going to be just like a drift in this"
6688.700,6689.200," cold"
6690.900,6691.900," bass somewhere"
6692.300,6694.900," and I don't know that's just stuff that's coming up for me and"
6695.800,6698.100," we were arresting with it a bit and yeah"
6699.100,6699.600," any thoughts"
6700.800,6705.200," yes let me just see that's that's very powerful and beautiful thank you for sharing"
6705.800,6706.600," parent um"
6707.800,6709.900," I mean when you when you describing sort of"
6710.600,6714.500," becoming into harmony with a process you know I I totally"
6715.800,6717.800," I totally know what you're talking about you know"
6718.400,6720.100," I feel that quite often myself that"
6720.600,6721.700," I found my own"
6723.100,6727.200," allowing this and then it seems to join a greater allowing this"
6728.500,6729.300," and I think that's true"
6729.900,6732.000," but look you know when we think of that"
6732.800,6735.400," cruelty in the Natural World"
6737.000,6737.100," I mean"
6738.400,6739.200," if it's real"
6739.900,6740.600," it's real"
6741.800,6742.600," it's not like"
6744.400,6745.000," suffering"
6746.100,6746.400," is"
6746.800,6747.300," optional"
6748.800,6749.600," you know I mean actually"
6750.900,6753.200," I've got a qualify that because lots of teachers say"
6753.900,6754.600," Kane"
6755.500,6758.800," suffering is optional pain is not so let me put it that way"
6759.800,6760.500," pain"
6760.900,6763.900," the reality of hardship and pain"
6764.600,6764.900," in"
6765.700,6769.600," the lives of living beings especially those presumably with"
6770.100,6771.100," more neurons"
6771.900,6772.200," you know"
6772.900,6774.000," that's real"
6775.200,6775.500," and"
6777.400,6778.400," that's not optional"
6779.600,6780.800," you know it's part of this"
6782.300,6783.200," biosphere"
6784.900,6786.000," that you know life"
6788.100,6789.100," feeds on life"
6790.800,6792.400," I mean even the cattle of"
6793.200,6794.900," ripping up the grasses you know"
6795.700,6797.600," grass is a living you may not be"
6798.300,6800.000," sentient but they're living you know"
6800.600,6802.100," it's it is a system"
6803.000,6804.600," the biosphere is a system"
6805.400,6806.000," you know and"
6807.600,6812.200," and it and it has all this transfer nutrients going on all over the place"
6813.500,6814.300," you know and I mean"
6815.100,6815.800," you know it's and"
6816.900,6817.400," death and"
6818.100,6819.100," devouring I"
6819.300,6820.600," a part of the system"
6822.200,6823.600," and we humans"
6825.500,6829.300," probably along with many other species have the capacity to"
6830.400,6831.400," be aware of that"
6832.400,6832.800," to"
6833.300,6835.600," communicate about it with one another"
6837.200,6837.500," and"
6840.100,6843.900," so we have the capacity to suffer and be aware of our suffering"
6845.800,6846.500," you know and"
6848.400,6849.800," in that situation"
6852.400,6854.600," we seem to have this capacity to"
6857.300,6858.600," to explore"
6859.200,6861.400," the possibilities of our own consciousness"
6862.700,6864.800," in some ways you know and find that"
6865.900,6867.200," there's more to it than"
6867.800,6868.600," met the eye"
6870.100,6874.000," and one of the big things we can make in that process of Discovery is that"
6874.700,6875.900," our sense of self"
6877.200,6877.600," isn't"
6878.500,6880.400," what it presents itself as being"
6882.500,6883.400," and that can be"
6884.400,6884.800," very"
6885.600,6886.100," liberating"
6886.800,6887.400," to discover"
6888.200,6888.900," and it can"
6890.200,6892.900," yeah bring us into a sense of intimacy"
6893.700,6895.100," with the unfolding of everything"
6897.700,6900.400," and that's also kind of beautiful to discover"
6901.000,6903.600," that we're not separate the way we thought we"
6904.700,6905.000," were but you know"
6906.900,6907.200," I mean"
6908.700,6910.800," in one sense of course we're still going to die"
6912.300,6915.200," and in another sense we we might claim"
6916.900,6918.600," that we can taste something that"
6921.100,6922.300," kind of isn't gonna die"
6924.000,6927.000," because in some way it never existed in the first place"
6927.300,6928.800," the way we thought it did"
6930.300,6931.300," all we might say"
6935.100,6936.600," some say you know there's"
6940.200,6940.400," that"
6940.900,6943.300," fourth consciousness if we're going to call it that"
6944.200,6946.300," characteristic less consciousness"
6947.700,6948.400," it's never born"
6949.800,6950.700," Never Dies"
6951.700,6952.600," as no space"
6953.400,6954.300," has no time"
6955.500,6956.000," and we"
6958.400,6959.200," are made of it"
6960.000,6960.700," we can"
6961.600,6965.300," it's in us it is us we can find it"
6966.000,6967.200," inside us ourselves"
6967.800,6970.400," inside the very Fabric of all our experience"
6972.100,6972.200," and"
6973.400,6975.200," it's on that's unconditional"
6976.400,6977.600," it's unconditioned"
6980.300,6981.400," and again does that mean"
6982.400,6983.400," we don't know anything about all"
6984.200,6985.700," difficult things happening in the world"
6986.600,6987.200," well no"
6988.000,6989.500," just because it's unconditioned"
6990.800,6991.400," it doesn't mean"
6992.400,6994.000," we ignore everything that is conditioned"
6995.800,6997.900," see what I mean it's not on the same level"
6998.500,6999.600," as all the things that conditioned"
7000.800,7004.400," maybe a kind of substrate to our lives but still our lives are going on"
7005.200,7007.800," and and still our lives need tending"
7009.300,7011.700," you know and we need to be putting our shoulder to the wheel"
7012.400,7013.800," where we think will be most helpful"
7015.000,7016.100," in the conditioned"
7019.000,7019.500," I don't know if that's"
7021.900,7022.500," some kind of"
7023.300,7024.100," thank you very much"
7025.100,7030.200," look folks it's we're going to we're gonna I won't say anymore it's about Sarah back to you"
