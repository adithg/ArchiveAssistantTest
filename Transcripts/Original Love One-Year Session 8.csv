205.000,205.900," ourselves"
206.900,208.800," from from the the Stream"
209.800,210.500," from the current"
211.200,212.300," the momentum of"
213.000,213.200," our"
213.700,214.600," everyday activities"
216.200,217.200," you know we're not we're not"
218.900,222.100," we're learning to practice in them that's always been"
222.900,223.100," the"
224.700,229.200," the vowed aim of most traditions of practice"
231.700,234.200," but actually having time like this where"
235.200,237.000," you know we gather in the"
238.200,238.800," tangible"
239.400,239.900," space"
241.000,241.800," of this"
243.800,246.700," you know this this cyberzone that"
247.200,248.800," we're all in this zoom"
249.600,250.200," xender"

259.800,260.400," no matter"
261.500,264.600," where we may be geographically we're all gathered right here"
265.800,266.700," and we're doing it"
267.600,268.000," in order"
268.500,268.500," to"
270.100,271.400," touch and taste"
272.800,274.500," what it is to be alive"
275.300,277.600," more vividly and more intimately"
279.200,280.300," you know I I am"
282.200,284.600," actually my new book I've got a little passage about"
285.700,290.000," how in airports you know that I used to often and I still do it from time to time"
290.700,293.100," find that multi-faced Chapel as they call it"
293.400,295.700," a little quiet space where"
296.400,298.100," you could just"
300.400,301.600," be outside"
302.100,302.200," the"
302.800,303.900," rushing stream"
304.600,307.600," that you know in a moment later you'll be part of again"
308.300,309.900," of slightly harried"
310.500,311.200," humanity"
312.000,314.400," trying to find his Gate wondering if the flights"
314.900,316.700," on time wondering if they're on time"
317.500,319.600," what are they going to do if the flight changes and"
320.100,321.900," one of their leaving and what are they going to towards"
322.600,324.200," that kind of current of"
326.000,330.500," I don't know you know there's a there's a certain energy in airports you know I think it can be"
331.400,331.700," little"
332.000,332.500," level of"
333.700,336.400," sympathetic nervous system activation in it"
336.800,337.400," that you can feel"
338.100,338.800," and yeah you can"
339.500,340.000," you can just"
340.600,340.800," take"
341.200,341.900," two steps"
342.300,343.100," out of the Stream"
344.000,344.900," be in a space"
346.100,347.500," that is set aside"
348.300,348.800," from that"
349.700,351.000," and that's what we're doing right now"
352.300,354.800," we're in a space that set beside"
355.900,357.200," and it's set aside"
358.200,359.400," for us to drop"
360.600,361.800," all that we"
362.900,364.200," are habitually"
365.200,366.000," caught up in"
367.100,369.600," we we just step out of it it's like"
369.900,372.000," when this I'm mixing metaphors here I know but"
372.600,373.600," you know could be that we're"
374.300,376.500," we're we're we're marching along carrying stuff"
377.600,378.900," so we can put the bags down"
379.400,380.600," we can put the baggage down"
381.600,383.500," or another metaphor we're in the river"
384.400,385.800," the river sweeping us along"
387.000,389.200," and kind of weary and be dragged and wet"
389.800,391.200," we climb out of the river"
392.400,393.800," and we're going to sit on the bank"
394.900,395.400," for a little bit"
396.400,396.700," together"
398.100,400.000," together in this shared space"
400.800,401.500," that is a space"
402.100,403.600," of practice meaning"
404.400,404.900," of being"
407.900,410.100," it's gonna say one notch more"
410.600,411.200," aware"
412.700,416.600," but I don't think that's the best way to put it I this may be better than this this"
418.000,419.200," practice meaning"
421.000,421.100," to"
421.900,423.900," just take a little step back"
424.900,425.800," into ourselves"
427.200,428.000," come into"
429.300,429.900," ourselves"
431.400,432.000," and be here"
433.500,434.400,"with ourselves"
436.700,440.200," you know there's a famous line in zen actually take the backward step"
441.500,442.800," that shines the lamp"
443.300,443.900," inwards"
445.800,448.100," so just taking us one step"
448.600,448.900," back"
451.100,451.500," to here"
452.400,454.300," so we're going to go into our first sit"
455.300,457.000," and just before we start I want to bring in"
458.500,459.300," an even"
461.400,463.800," a really foundational line from Zen"
464.300,467.000," and one of the first things said about this form of practice"
467.900,468.800," as a distinct"
469.600,471.800," Strand in the great we've of Buddhism"
472.900,473.800," in early"
474.900,475.800," Buddhist China"
476.700,478.300," maybe the fifth or 6th century"
479.500,482.100," and not relying on words and letters"
484.200,485.600," Direct transmission"
486.500,487.500," outside scripture"
489.300,489.700," simply"
492.500,494.800," looking into your own heart"
495.600,496.500," and finding"
497.200,497.600," Buddha"
501.000,502.400," looking into your own heart"
503.200,504.200," and finding"
505.100,505.600," Buddha"
507.600,508.000," so"
508.700,509.600," let's come into"
511.300,511.600," our"
512.700,513.000," sitting"
513.600,514.100," arrangement"
515.600,516.700," arrangement of body"
522.800,523.000," yeah"
524.000,524.900," arrangement of"
526.500,527.200," mind"
529.400,533.200," settling the mind settle the body settle the mind settle the heart"
535.200,538.300," and that's what we'll be doing actually in the course of the sift"
540.700,541.900," so let's start with the body"
546.700,547.000," maybe"
548.300,549.700," take a couple of deep breaths"
550.700,553.000," in your own time feeling the lungs and emptying them"
571.800,573.800," and then let's have a three-quarter breath"
580.100,580.600," and then"
581.200,582.400," release the breath"
582.600,584.900," to do what it naturally does"
588.200,590.200," sometimes bigger sometimes smaller"
592.700,595.000," sometimes faster sometimes slower"
597.400,598.000," just let it"
600.600,601.800," follow its own course"
605.100,606.100," lower the gaze"
606.800,607.000," or"
607.500,608.400," close the eyes"
614.000,616.700," let's sway a little bit from side to side"
618.900,621.000," just a few inches either way"
623.200,624.300," at your own pace"
626.600,628.700," find a PACE that feels good"
637.200,639.100," let me movement be smooth"
642.600,643.600," feeling or seat"
646.200,648.300," notice The Subtle change in"
649.300,650.200," in the weight"
650.600,651.400," in the seat"
652.600,655.700," as you sway from side to side"
661.400,663.300," slow down the movement"
672.000,674.000," and let it become a little bit smaller"
677.000,681.000," and start to sense where the balance zone"
681.800,683.300," is in the middle"
686.800,688.700," and then let it be that you're just going"
691.900,694.900," from one side to the other very small movements"
695.800,696.400," of that"
696.800,698.400," zone of balance"
704.900,705.900," and then be like"
707.500,710.100," a pendulum that's losing momentum"
713.900,714.600," was coming"
715.100,716.600," closer and closer"
718.100,719.100," to a state of rest"
720.900,722.400," and then come into"
724.100,724.900," rest"
726.300,726.900," in the middle"
737.900,739.600," that yourself experience"
740.200,740.800," balance"
745.600,747.300," and the possibility"
747.600,747.900," now"
749.600,750.500," over relaxing"
753.400,755.600," relaxed release the jaw"
757.300,758.400," relax the throat"
761.500,762.600," relax shoulders"
765.000,766.500," arms and hands"
771.200,772.400," relax the chest"
777.600,778.300," relax the"
779.900,781.300," shoulder blades and the"
781.800,782.800," back ribs"
786.800,788.200," diaphragm soft"
789.400,790.100," belly soft"
792.300,793.800," lower back soft"
795.900,796.700," balanced"
799.300,800.300," wait in the seat"
802.100,802.500," hips"
803.100,803.600," loose"
804.900,807.200," legs loose feet toes"
808.500,809.000," loose"
819.500,820.800," starting to taste"
822.500,823.000," illness"
840.700,841.400," and any time"
842.500,844.500," if you need to move or adjust"
845.300,845.900," the body just"
847.500,848.000," quietly"
848.900,851.100," slowly in mindfully do so"
854.100,855.800," otherwise see what it's like"
857.600,858.700," to be still"
866.700,869.400," noticed if there might be a way in which"
871.100,873.000," the body seems to become"
874.500,876.300," somehow rather clear"
878.700,879.600," or transparent"
882.500,883.300," when we're still"
895.800,897.100," sometimes the body"
898.600,899.200," seems to be"
900.600,902.400," clear enough that there's no"
904.100,906.000," kind of there's no transition point"
906.400,907.400," between the body"
908.500,910.200," and the space around us"
914.000,916.000," almost like there's just one clear"
917.800,918.300," space"
919.200,920.700," or one clarity"
935.800,936.100," and"
938.600,941.300," we might start to notice that the fabric"
941.900,942.800," of sounds"
953.900,956.000," both very subtle sounds"
957.300,957.500," and"
959.000,959.100," more"
960.000,961.500," distinctive sounds"
986.400,989.100," the same way the body can be quite clear"
990.900,992.200," almost transparent"
993.500,995.600," is there a way the sound scape"
995.900,997.000," sound field"
997.900,998.400," is also"
999.600,1001.100," clear and kind of"
1002.100,1003.000," transparent"
1072.600,1073.800," the breath"
1074.600,1075.500," moves"
1075.800,1076.500," through this"
1077.800,1079.100," clear space"
1082.500,1084.800," sounds arise in this"
1086.300,1087.300," clear space"
1095.900,1097.500," and sometimes thoughts"
1099.200,1101.100," arise emerge"
1102.700,1104.800," into the same clear space"
1124.100,1127.300," if we notice that we've been thinking"
1129.000,1129.900," and in a sense"
1130.700,1133.100," left this moment into the thoughts"
1134.600,1135.700," when we notice that"
1136.900,1138.500," we congratulate ourselves"
1141.100,1141.400," on"
1142.900,1143.500," returning"
1143.800,1144.900," coming back to here"
1146.400,1149.400," just check whether the thinking was"
1150.800,1151.700," memories"
1152.500,1153.300," or planning"
1154.600,1154.700," or"
1155.300,1155.900," imagining"
1158.900,1160.700," and give them a label"
1162.200,1163.100," one of those three"
1167.400,1168.200," and thank them"
1169.800,1170.900," be grateful to them"
1174.100,1174.800," acknowledge them"
1178.700,1179.700," and rest here"
1180.400,1180.800," again"
1205.000,1205.300," and then"
1207.500,1207.700," let's"
1208.600,1211.100," gently become more aware"
1212.100,1213.700," of the heart area"
1216.500,1217.900," approximately mid"
1218.900,1219.600," torso"
1221.800,1222.800," perhaps chest"
1225.700,1227.400," and just see if there's any"
1228.500,1229.700," Sensation"
1231.700,1232.400," there"
1236.000,1236.300," and"
1240.000,1242.200," there might be or there-- might not be"
1246.900,1247.700," but either way"
1250.800,1253.400," perhaps the sensations whatever"
1253.900,1255.000," they may be are"
1256.500,1257.000," I really"
1258.300,1258.700," subtle"
1260.700,1263.400," subtle muscular sensations"
1264.800,1265.200," subtle"
1266.200,1266.800," notes"
1268.600,1269.300," in the muscular"
1274.000,1274.900," and they too"
1277.400,1278.200," arise"
1279.800,1280.200," in the"
1281.500,1282.400," clear space"
1289.300,1290.700," and the clear space"
1293.000,1294.100," fully welcomes them"
1296.000,1297.900," it has no resistance"
1303.000,1304.600," all is welcome"
1312.700,1314.700," everything has its place"
1398.200,1401.700,"the the invitation is to rest"
1404.400,1405.700," in or with"
1408.700,1409.700," a clear space"
1412.400,1413.200," and sometimes"
1414.800,1415.600," we know this"
1416.900,1417.700," sounds"
1418.700,1419.100," sometimes"
1421.000,1422.400," we know this breath"
1424.500,1425.100," sometimes"
1426.500,1427.300," we notice"
1429.000,1430.100," thoughts thinking"
1432.100,1432.600," sometimes"
1433.400,1434.200," we know this"
1436.200,1438.700," subtle muscular Sensation"
1441.700,1442.800,"in the chest and"
1443.500,1445.200," mid torso areas"
1448.300,1449.100," and sometimes"
1451.800,1452.300," where"
1452.600,1454.400," basically at rest"
1457.100,1457.300," and"
1458.600,1461.000," these various experiences"
1462.900,1464.900," thinking breathing hearing"
1466.300,1467.500," body sensations"
1468.900,1470.500," these various experiences"
1473.300,1474.600," become a little more"
1476.200,1477.600," kind of remote"
1479.800,1480.300," A level"
1480.800,1481.600," quieter"
1486.100,1488.200," we might notice them but they don't"
1489.500,1492.100," draw us in quite the same way"
1496.100,1496.700," we're more"
1498.900,1500.300," suffused with"
1502.600,1503.800," a clear space"
1508.200,1508.900," resting"
1526.800,1529.000," and then some views"
1529.800,1531.500," this clear space"
1533.000,1534.500," is the space of"
1536.200,1536.300," the"
1536.800,1536.900," heart"
1539.400,1539.700," the"
1540.300,1541.400," heart and includes"
1542.500,1542.800," everything"
1547.300,1548.400," but welcome us"
1550.500,1551.000," everything"
1560.800,1561.400," is open"
1563.200,1563.800," to everything"
1573.200,1575.300," really in a way that loves"
1576.500,1576.900," everything"
1730.200,1731.200,"see how"
1731.800,1732.300," little"
1733.500,1734.400," you can demand"
1734.900,1735.900," of your practice"
1740.300,1741.200," of this moment"
1743.700,1746.500," see how undemanding"
1747.800,1748.500," you can be"
1757.900,1759.100," what if really"
1760.100,1760.500," nothing"
1761.900,1762.900," need to be different"
1764.400,1765.000," just now"
1862.800,1865.300," if you'd like you might even"
1866.000,1867.100," Explorer"
1867.200,1867.600," whether"
1868.700,1870.800," the sun note"
1872.100,1873.400," perhaps subtle"
1875.200,1876.700," this seems to be saying"
1878.000,1880.700," no this isn't quite right no"
1882.000,1884.800," somehow there's something that's not right"
1886.600,1888.100," that shouldn't be here"
1889.200,1890.300," should be different"
1893.200,1895.500," and if you can find"
1896.700,1898.400," some subtle signal"
1899.300,1900.000," like that"
1901.800,1904.400," my just B A subtle Sensation"
1905.700,1907.500," in the torsa perhaps"
1910.000,1912.900," then see if that can be fully"
1913.600,1914.300," allowed"
1915.500,1917.100," that doesn't need"
1918.000,1918.500," to change"
1921.300,1922.800," the clear space"
1924.200,1925.200," allows it"
1926.600,1927.300," welcome to"
1929.000,1929.800," love it"
1986.400,1987.700," what if there"
1988.600,1990.200," were no resistance"
1990.700,1991.400," at all"
1993.300,1994.300," what would that"
1994.600,1995.200," be like"
2027.800,2030.500," what happens to resistance"
2032.600,2034.000," if there's no"
2034.700,2036.100," resistance to it"
2086.300,2089.800," what does all of this have to do"
2090.900,2092.100," with who we are"
2094.900,2096.000," resistance"
2097.600,2099.000," no resistance"
2102.300,2103.900," the clear space that"
2105.100,2105.800," welcomed"
2108.200,2109.100," the love"
2110.800,2111.500," that"
2111.600,2112.100," allows"
2116.200,2118.000," what is it all have to do"
2119.100,2119.400," with"
2120.600,2120.800," me"
2145.200,2146.600," what is it have to do"
2148.000,2148.600," with who"
2150.800,2151.100," we are"
2242.600,2245.100," if it feels natural bring"
2246.100,2247.500," a soft smile"
2248.900,2250.400," a little bit of a smile"
2251.400,2252.500," into the face"
2258.800,2261.300," and notice if that has any"
2262.500,2265.300," appreciable effect in the body"
2268.100,2269.500," in the body feel"
2279.300,2281.400," and do anything just be with it"
2283.300,2283.800," whatever it is"
2295.800,2297.400," and do nothing at all"
2390.500,2391.800," and keep"
2392.600,2394.900," doing nothing at all"
2396.700,2398.200," for as long as you like"
2405.300,2406.800," and a moment well"
2408.700,2410.200," go into a break"
2420.800,2422.600," and you may"
2425.100,2425.800," want to"
2429.200,2431.400," resume movement right away"
2433.000,2434.600," or you may want to"
2436.400,2439.700," keep doing nothing at all and stillness"
2446.700,2447.300," either way"
2449.200,2449.400," will"
2451.500,2454.100," or gather rig raghava"
2455.900,2458.700," in just under 10 minutes or so"
2460.400,2460.600," at"
2461.300,2462.300," 10 minutes to"
2464.500,2465.000," the hour"
2466.200,2466.600," thank you"
2468.000,2468.600," all of you"
2469.300,2470.600," for being here to"
2471.400,2471.900," practice"
2472.500,2473.500," together like this"
2473.900,2474.200," thank you"
2783.500,2784.100,"okay"
2785.400,2785.900," so"
2788.000,2788.300," ah"
2788.700,2789.000," where"
2790.600,2792.600," where where where where we're regathering"
2795.000,2795.500," gently"
2798.300,2800.400," and lovely to see everybody"
2804.100,2804.800," I'm just having a quick"
2805.900,2807.000," quick glance at the"
2808.700,2809.400," the gallery"
2811.000,2811.900," so um"
2813.400,2813.600," these"
2815.400,2815.600," you know"
2816.500,2818.900," power up the video if you feel like it it's nice to"
2819.300,2820.000," to see you but"
2820.900,2822.200," I know there may be many reasons why"
2823.000,2824.700," that's not convenient that's just fine"
2828.200,2828.800," yeah just"
2830.000,2831.000," the starting shortly"
2832.100,2833.900," just kind of looking at everybody"
2835.200,2838.000," very nice to to see you all thank you for being here again"
2839.300,2841.600," thank you for practicing I hope that sit was"
2842.700,2845.700," was you know helpful in some way and that perhaps"
2847.200,2853.300," was just a flavour that you you might not normally get when you're sitting on your own though I know many of you are very"
2854.400,2856.700," very seasoned practitioners and"
2857.600,2859.900," I'm sure there are many dimensions of"
2860.600,2862.100," practice that you haven't already"
2862.900,2864.200," encountered many of you"
2865.100,2866.200," and so I'm just"
2867.200,2869.500," offering the angles here and there that may seem"
2870.600,2871.500," sometimes seem a little"
2871.900,2872.300," a little"
2873.100,2876.000," either new or just refreshers of things you've known before"
2877.000,2880.600," and I'm grateful that you you grant me the privilege of"
2881.500,2883.800," leading these sits"
2886.600,2888.400," the way the way that I try to do"
2889.300,2893.500," so what we're going to do in this talk when I'm what's Henry going to be China"
2893.800,2894.300," trying to do"
2894.900,2897.300," well basically there are three things that I want to"
2899.800,2903.700," I want to address all through this lens of looking inward"
2904.600,2905.300," because that was the"
2905.800,2906.900," the revolutionary thing"
2907.500,2910.300," that zen brought to the world of practice"
2911.400,2913.200," 1500 years ago"
2913.800,2916.300," was essentially that exactly that line"
2916.700,2918.100," look into your own heart"
2918.700,2920.000," and find Buddha"
2920.900,2924.000," you know it's it's there's there's different translations but"
2924.600,2927.400," pointing directly at the human heart"
2927.800,2928.600," I'm discovering"
2929.200,2929.600," Budd"
2930.600,2931.400," discovering"
2932.000,2933.000," what is already"
2934.000,2934.800," Awakened"
2936.000,2939.300," you know that's that's the heart of that word Buddha is Awakened"
2940.100,2940.300," and"
2941.700,2946.500," the whole krux really of our life rests on what that means"
2947.900,2949.200," what that word"
2949.800,2951.000," is a stiper"
2951.600,2952.000," bore"
2952.700,2953.600," or a glyph"
2954.400,2956.800," bored you know it's don't think of it as a word"
2957.400,2958.200," that has a meaning"
2958.900,2960.000," think of it more as a little"
2960.800,2961.900," x you know"
2962.400,2963.500," x marks the spot"
2963.900,2966.300," all it is is just a pointer on a map"
2967.000,2968.400," but it's nothing to do with a"
2969.000,2970.800," map is to do with this moment"
2971.500,2971.900," now"
2972.900,2973.700," and the word"
2974.600,2976.200," isn't really it's it's"
2976.800,2978.000," unimportant"
2978.500,2979.600," it's not a word"
2980.100,2982.700," the the word is just a symbol"
2983.500,2984.400," or is just a little"
2985.700,2986.200," scratch"
2986.700,2988.700," you know on a window pane or something"
2989.900,2990.600," it's not"
2991.300,2992.300," the reality"
2993.500,2993.900," that it"
2994.300,2994.900," references"
2995.500,2997.100," the reality that it references"
2997.700,2998.600," is here"
2999.700,3002.500," in our very experience"
3003.400,3003.800," now"
3006.500,3008.100," and what zen said"
3008.500,3009.100," essentially"
3009.900,3011.000," simplifying it a lot"
3011.600,3012.700," is you don't"
3013.500,3014.600," have to have"
3015.300,3016.600," thousands of Life times"
3017.300,3019.700," we don't even know if you have more than one lifetime"
3020.400,3021.500," we're not interested in that"
3022.100,3022.800," all we know"
3023.400,3024.700," is that you're alive now"
3026.600,3030.100," and when we're not really even interested in down the road in this life"
3030.800,3032.000," we're really only-- interested in"
3032.600,3033.100," now"
3034.000,3034.900," and rather than"
3036.200,3038.100," having a doctrine or a"
3038.700,3040.000," belief system that says"
3040.800,3044.400," there is such a thing is really incarnation and you've got to go round and round and round"
3045.200,3046.800," dozens of thousands of times"
3047.500,3049.200," and then somewhere along that"
3050.900,3053.500," cyclical process you'll be lucky enough to discover"
3054.200,3056.300," the Buddha dharma the practice you know"
3056.800,3059.600," and you'll start practicing and then you're going to have another"
3061.100,3066.300," multiple thousands of lifetimes of practicing and then eventually you'll get to"
3067.300,3068.500," a lifetime where"
3068.900,3070.700," you'll be practicing so diligently"
3071.400,3075.000," and the circumstances and conditions will be so rip"
3075.300,3077.300," that you get to be a monastic"
3078.400,3080.000," and then when you're a monastic"
3080.500,3084.600," there's a chance after a multiple lifetimes you might start having an insight"
3084.800,3085.500," here or there"
3086.000,3088.000," and these insights might chip away"
3088.600,3089.900," over different lifetimes"
3090.400,3091.400," yeah the sort"
3091.600,3092.500," of cluster of"
3093.400,3100.400," in crustaceans that make you who you think you are and bit by bit Lifetime by our lifetime pieces might fall off"
3100.800,3102.100," and eventually in some"
3102.400,3102.600," you know"
3103.000,3105.400," unspecified leave remote"
3106.300,3106.700," type you might"
3107.300,3107.900," Awakened"
3110.700,3111.400," zen said"
3112.600,3113.000," rubbish"
3114.200,3114.900," is already here"
3115.800,3116.700," it's just a matter"
3117.500,3118.900," of noticing it"
3119.800,3120.700," it's just a matter"
3121.500,3122.100," of one"
3122.900,3123.200," week"
3123.800,3125.400," in the angle of light"
3126.600,3128.700," so this very moment"
3129.900,3130.200," and it's"
3133.500,3134.900," complexity the"
3135.900,3138.800," the the multiple the multifaceted"
3139.400,3140.200," experience"
3140.700,3143.800," of right now just as it is for you"
3144.300,3145.400," one tweak"
3145.600,3146.800," in the angular light"
3147.600,3150.400," will pass one tweak in the angle of perspective"
3151.400,3152.500," and you see"
3154.300,3155.000," clean through it"
3156.600,3158.700," it's like one then teacher"
3159.700,3161.500," in our lineage she used to say"
3163.100,3166.500," what is this this this this this moment of Awakening this shift"
3167.500,3167.700," from"
3168.900,3171.100," how we've always seen it and understood it to"
3172.100,3172.500," ah"
3172.700,3174.700," a really new way I really different way"
3175.400,3179.300," I say new but that's not quite right because it's not new it's always been here"
3180.000,3182.200," it's also not new because when it happens"
3182.800,3183.900," there's often"
3184.900,3186.800," mixed in with the"
3188.100,3190.700," certain shock of Discovery there's also"
3191.700,3193.300," usually some sense of"
3194.500,3196.300," oh my god I've come home"
3196.700,3197.800," I've come back"
3198.700,3200.000," I've known this"
3200.800,3203.000," oh my god this is this thing that I have known"
3203.800,3206.100," for so long and somehow forgotten"
3206.900,3209.300," so totally forgotten on this totally familiar"
3210.400,3211.500," and she said it's like"
3212.100,3216.300," if the if you're looking at a leaf from the same side that light is shining on it"
3216.700,3218.200," it looks solid and green"
3218.800,3220.500," and you get the other side of it"
3221.000,3222.000," and the leaf becomes"
3223.200,3224.700," translucent and gold"
3225.500,3227.400," so it's like that with this world"
3228.300,3232.600," but you know we look at it the way we normally look at it and a habituated and conditioned"
3233.100,3234.500," and accustomed to seeing it"
3234.900,3235.900," and understanding it"
3236.300,3238.500," and processing and interpreting it"
3239.200,3239.800," and then in this"
3240.300,3241.100," instant of"
3242.000,3242.800," Awakening"
3244.500,3245.100," it is as if"
3246.200,3247.600," illuminated"
3249.100,3250.500," buy a light that was always here"
3251.300,3252.100," but that we hadn't"
3252.900,3253.400," somehow"
3255.500,3256.300," we'd forgotten"
3258.000,3259.500," with forgotten how to see you"
3260.700,3263.500," and it's like it turns to translucent gold"
3264.300,3267.500," I mean don't take that too literally you know have to"
3268.400,3270.000," look at the table in it becomes"
3270.400,3272.900," glowing gold you know that's not that's not a"
3273.300,3273.900," prophecy of"
3274.700,3277.000," characteristic of an Awakening experience"
3277.600,3281.200," but it but if by analogy it all becomes"
3281.900,3282.100," more"
3284.100,3285.100," in substantial"
3286.200,3287.700," and at the same time"
3289.000,3289.800," more beautiful"
3290.800,3292.400," it vastly beautiful"
3297.500,3297.600," so"
3298.500,3299.500," I want to talk about that"
3300.500,3301.600," and I also want to talk about"
3302.800,3305.400," a little bit about body dharma he's the"
3306.300,3310.000," the man credited with having said that initial"
3310.800,3315.200," sort of seed planting line about Chan Buddhism or zen Buddhism"
3315.800,3317.100," they're the same thing zein is"
3317.600,3318.900," then is the word Chan"
3319.600,3321.500," zen is the Japanese word for the Chinese word"
3321.900,3322.300," Chan"
3322.900,3324.800," chan I'm sure I'm not pronouncing it quite right but"
3325.600,3326.200," still in like that"
3327.200,3329.800," so also wanted to talk a bit about buddy and I also want to"
3331.600,3332.200," I want to say"
3333.400,3333.900," something about"
3335.800,3338.200," about the fact that it's Mother's Day"
3339.100,3340.900," and that's a very special"
3341.500,3341.700," in"
3342.600,3344.100," all of us because all of us"
3345.000,3345.200," you know"
3345.600,3346.100," are here"
3347.200,3348.000," but for the"
3348.400,3350.600," but for the grace of our mothers we wouldn't be here"
3351.000,3351.100," you know"
3352.000,3352.900," I personally have"
3353.600,3356.400," sort of two dear mothers in my life one is"
3357.300,3357.600," my mum"
3358.800,3360.900," who I saw recently when I was back in England"
3361.900,3364.200,"um and the other is"
3364.600,3365.900," is my wife Claire"
3366.000,3366.300," it was"
3367.600,3370.900," the mother that I in a way no best actually because"
3371.900,3373.700," I've been an adult"
3374.200,3375.700," able to know her as an adult"
3376.200,3379.100," whereas still my relationship with my my mum"
3379.800,3380.900," is honestly still"
3382.100,3382.800," it's still got"
3383.200,3383.500," you know"
3384.000,3385.000," some occlusion"
3386.000,3388.800," by clouds of infancy and"
3389.500,3390.800," and toddler Hood you know"
3392.300,3394.300," it's really interesting to see how these things"
3394.700,3395.400," come up and I"
3396.100,3399.200," man I still get that you know that thing of"
3399.800,3400.500," in some way"
3402.400,3406.600," bite of all these years and by being a dad myself and you know"
3407.100,3408.900," I still get some of the"
3409.500,3410.500," wiring from"
3411.100,3413.100," from really early life comes on"
3414.500,3418.600," when I'm around him we I'm not happily we had a very nice time to get them we"
3418.900,3420.000," we usually do have had"
3420.800,3423.400," I had periods when you know a relationship was"
3425.300,3427.800," you know really I found very challenging and"
3428.500,3428.600," you know"
3429.400,3429.500," and"
3430.400,3431.800," but it was a beautiful visit"
3432.700,3437.900," recently she's I can't remember if I've mentioned this but she's just written a book which we were celebrating"
3438.900,3440.200," she found an agent"
3440.400,3442.400," who sold it to a publisher and"
3443.200,3445.200," came out a week or two ago"
3445.600,3447.800," and it's a very interesting book"
3448.500,3450.200," historical book about her"
3450.500,3451.100," grandfather"
3452.000,3452.200," and"
3453.300,3453.500," yeah"
3453.900,3454.200," anyway"
3460.100,3467.400," the point about mothers that I wanted to say in our zen world is actually the"
3469.700,3470.900," well let me just let me just"
3471.400,3473.800," let me just I just need a little moment just"
3476.600,3478.000," just to settle back in"
3480.000,3480.100," yeah"
3481.400,3481.400," so"
3483.200,3483.500," we"
3484.800,3487.300," this figure of Zen body Dharma"
3488.000,3488.300," is"
3490.200,3491.200," Demi historically"
3492.000,3493.900," and semi legendary"
3494.800,3496.600," he's given the credit for bringing"
3498.200,3498.800," Diana"
3499.200,3499.600," Buddhism"
3502.100,3502.600," Jannah"
3503.800,3504.900," is the word that became"
3505.400,3506.900," China and then Chan"
3507.400,3508.100," in China"
3508.700,3510.700," and then send in Japan"
3511.300,3512.300," he's credited"
3513.000,3516.900," and this is definitely a vastly oversimplified Version Of Events"
3517.400,3518.800," he's credited with bringing"
3520.100,3523.100," zen Buddhism then called Janna Buddhism"
3523.800,3524.400," their China"
3524.800,3525.000," from"
3525.600,3526.000," India"
3526.900,3530.000," which was the origin of Buddhism of course was in India"
3531.100,3533.500," with shakim Buddha with sudata ketama"
3534.200,3534.200," so"
3535.400,3535.600," here's"
3536.300,3539.000," back story is that his teacher was called"
3539.600,3540.600," rashna Tara"
3542.000,3542.200," and"
3542.900,3548.400," always traditionally taken to be a man but there's some scholarship now that thinks"
3549.500,3550.300," she might have been a woman"
3551.600,3552.900," and prison attara"
3555.000,3556.200," told birdie Dahmer"
3557.900,3559.000," when she was about to die"
3560.300,3562.100," that in 60"
3562.700,3563.300," years"
3563.900,3565.000," he buried armour"
3565.600,3567.000," should go from India"
3567.700,3571.100," that China which was a long difficult journey in the end it took three years"
3571.800,3572.900," but he should go there"
3573.400,3574.400," and share"
3575.400,3576.300," the Dharma"
3576.600,3577.300," that hid"
3578.200,3580.100," being enabled to discover through her"
3580.700,3582.600," the practice and the"
3583.100,3583.700," the wisdom"
3585.100,3587.200," of this liberative"
3587.800,3588.400," insight"
3589.400,3589.700," into"
3591.600,3593.900," who and what we are and what all this is"
3594.700,3597.000," and another way of experiencing all this"
3598.100,3598.800," that is"
3599.900,3601.400," greatly freeing"
3602.600,3602.800," that"
3605.800,3608.600," sorry I'm I'm checking my language a bit because"
3609.200,3610.400," it didn't freeing"
3611.000,3613.900," is the discovery of what has always been free"
3615.500,3617.400," and therefore in a sense it's freeing"
3617.700,3618.100," for us"
3619.600,3621.200," but we don't even really even know what that"
3621.800,3623.900," kind of freedom is until we taste it"
3624.500,3626.500," what kind of freedom is being pointed to"
3627.200,3630.600," and and you know we can say is that a vast openness"
3631.200,3633.300," there's just no obstructions anywhere there's no"
3633.800,3634.700," hindrance anywhere"
3635.000,3635.700," everything is"
3636.500,3638.400," really being itself everything is"
3639.000,3639.700," a rising"
3640.500,3643.200," just as it does and there's no getting in the way of it"
3643.900,3644.900," it's all"
3646.900,3647.400," open"
3648.400,3648.600," all"
3650.100,3650.900," blooming"
3652.000,3652.700," in its own"
3653.400,3654.900," each thing and it's own way"
3655.500,3656.700," and everything together"
3657.400,3659.600," in one sort of symfony"
3661.200,3662.500," that has no purpose"
3663.400,3664.300," other than just to"
3666.700,3667.200," flourish"
3668.600,3669.600," it just does it"
3670.300,3671.000," for the sake of"
3671.500,3671.900," doing it"
3673.100,3673.400," there's no"
3674.000,3675.200," ulterior motive"
3675.800,3676.900," and then never has been"
3677.700,3679.200," all of this world is just of"
3679.700,3681.000," a flourishing"
3681.700,3682.800," a blue moon"
3684.300,3685.700," Mother's Day blue"
3687.200,3689.400," and mother is appropriate here actually because"
3691.600,3691.900," because"
3692.800,3696.000," rajna you know that word that's in present tyres name"
3696.500,3697.700," president means wisdom"
3698.500,3701.300," and there's a whole thread of Buddhism"
3702.300,3703.300," three dating them"
3703.800,3704.100," from the"
3705.000,3709.900," late first Millennium BCE right around the Year 0"
3710.800,3712.100," the school of Buddhism"
3713.700,3715.100," or president of parameter"
3716.000,3718.700," Buddhism prajna means wisdom"
3720.100,3721.200," and parameter"
3722.000,3728.100," and we don't really need to worry about that right now it's one of the six parameters in a is Wisdom and parameter means"
3728.800,3729.800," a means of"
3732.800,3733.400," crossing over"
3734.600,3738.300," and means of crossing over or we might say a means of transformation"
3739.600,3742.000," a method or a means or a tool or"
3742.800,3745.000," yeah something like that of trans"
3747.600,3747.700," so"
3749.400,3750.100," one of these"
3750.800,3751.700," means of transforming"
3752.300,3752.400," is"
3752.900,3754.400," price and it's the sixth then"
3755.400,3756.200," greatest one"
3756.800,3756.800," so"
3758.100,3759.000," wisdom"
3760.700,3762.200," was seen actually"
3763.200,3764.300," as the mother"
3765.800,3766.800," of all buddhas"
3767.800,3768.500," and the mother"
3769.000,3770.200," of all going to quote"
3770.600,3771.200," dharmas"
3772.100,3772.400," meaning"
3773.700,3775.300," the mother of all teachings"
3777.000,3777.400," the mother"
3778.600,3779.000," of all"
3780.400,3780.800," things"
3782.600,3782.600," so"
3783.500,3785.100," this word wisdom"
3786.000,3786.700," doesn't mean"
3787.700,3789.000," wisdom in the sense that"
3790.000,3790.900," we use it"
3792.100,3793.200," you know as sort of"
3793.400,3794.700," understanding things"
3795.800,3798.000," or however however we might"
3798.700,3799.300," designate that"
3800.800,3803.300," exactly you know it means something a little"
3803.900,3805.400," different it means"
3806.900,3807.100," the"
3808.500,3809.200," source"
3810.700,3811.300," of all things"
3813.400,3815.300," sometimes called the womb"
3816.500,3818.100," of all buddhas and all things"
3818.700,3819.300," prasna"
3819.800,3820.900," that's what Wisdom is"
3821.600,3822.500," so Wisdom is"
3822.900,3823.800," our great"
3824.600,3824.900," mother"
3826.600,3827.700," or you put it the other way around"
3829.600,3830.500," the great mother"
3831.000,3831.800," of all things"
3833.000,3835.000," the great womb and source"
3835.500,3837.000," of all things the"
3837.600,3838.100," reality"
3839.500,3841.300," from which all experienced"
3842.200,3842.900," arises"
3847.000,3848.100," it's just designated"
3849.300,3849.800," with them"
3852.200,3853.900," so you can get a sense maybe here again"
3854.700,3856.400," like I was saying with that word Buddha"
3857.200,3858.000," but it's not"
3858.600,3859.400," a direct"
3862.100,3862.900," Australia's literation"
3863.700,3864.900," it's not a direct"
3865.700,3866.500," it doesn't mean"
3868.400,3871.100," the same way the word table means this object"
3872.400,3873.200," it's not like that"
3873.900,3874.800," the word Buddha"
3875.200,3876.200," doesn't mean a"
3876.600,3877.600," noble thing"
3878.700,3879.400," it means"
3882.400,3884.800," another way of experiencing this very moment"
3888.500,3891.600," and likewise this word Wisdom or prasna"
3892.300,3894.800," as an atarra birdy diamond is great teacher"
3895.400,3895.800," she"
3897.100,3899.700," wasn't you know she she's not about"
3900.700,3901.900," another person"
3902.800,3903.100," another"
3904.000,3904.600," paragraph"
3905.200,3906.400," teaching something no"
3907.400,3908.700," it's about essentially again"
3909.200,3910.300," and another way"
3910.900,3912.500," of experiencing"
3913.800,3916.800," a Discovery about the nature of"
3917.500,3918.200," experiencing"
3920.000,3921.200," and when I say experiencing"
3921.700,3923.500," I don't mean something abstract I mean"
3924.000,3924.800," I'm trying to say"
3925.200,3927.000," I using that word to mean right now"
3928.000,3928.700," now"
3929.200,3929.500," this"
3930.000,3931.000," very moment"
3931.800,3932.800," is already"
3933.400,3933.900," prison"
3935.300,3935.800," it's already"
3936.600,3937.000," Buddha"
3944.900,3950.000," okay so I've done this I'm realising what I've done is I've been trying to introduce what I was going to talk about"
3950.500,3952.100," getting caught up in talking about it"
3952.700,3957.000," so I'm working my way through the main points I wanted to make"
3958.000,3958.600," instead of"
3959.100,3960.300," telling you what they were going to be"
3961.200,3962.100," I'm sorry I'm sure"
3962.800,3965.000," you know this is not very good Oratory"
3965.600,3965.700," you know"
3967.400,3969.800," but thank you for bearing with me"
3970.300,3970.500," now"
3971.800,3972.600," buddy Dahmer"
3973.100,3973.400," so"
3974.000,3975.000," no need to tell you a little bit"
3975.500,3976.500," a couple of stories I want to"
3977.100,3978.600," make sure we get to from his life"
3982.300,3982.600," here"
3985.200,3987.300," he did what his teacher had said"
3987.800,3988.500," he was"
3989.300,3989.800," he was actually"
3990.700,3992.100," 67 years old"
3993.000,3994.400," when she said to him"
3995.100,3996.900," wait 60 years then go to China"
3997.700,4000.400," so when he was 127 and I did say"
4001.200,4002.500," his semi-historical"
4003.400,4004.200," semi legend"
4004.800,4007.200," I think there's a agreement that they're definitely was"
4007.800,4009.700," a Buddhist master called buddy Dahmer"
4010.100,4011.800," in the late fifth century"
4012.900,4015.100," ball 70s 480 who went"
4015.600,4016.200," from India"
4016.600,4017.100," to China"
4018.000,4020.400," actually they've been a stream of Buddhist"
4021.200,4022.500," monks and monastics"
4023.200,4024.700," in the first five centuries"
4025.600,4026.300," CE and"
4026.800,4030.100," anyway so there's going to be some conflation of some of them"
4030.800,4032.100," attached to him and then"
4032.800,4036.800," there wasn't a lot of record keeping so much in those early years it was then"
4037.300,4039.700," with my very good records later from about"
4040.700,4042.000," 750 onwards"
4043.100,4046.800," not so good as early so a lot of room for Legend and folks"
4047.200,4048.800," and mythology folks hours after"
4049.600,4050.000," Creep in"
4050.500,4051.900," but suffice to say"
4052.400,4053.700," 127 years old"
4054.400,4055.200," he goes to China"
4055.600,4058.000," 130 years old here rise in China"
4059.500,4059.700," and"
4060.600,4064.400," he is his first celebrated Encounter"
4065.200,4065.800," in China"
4066.800,4067.000," is"
4067.600,4070.300," a piece of Incredible Good Fortune for him"
4071.500,4072.400," that turns out"
4072.900,4073.900," very interestingly"
4074.200,4076.100," basically there's there's a"
4076.600,4077.300," there are two"
4079.400,4084.400," I don't know what to call them Empires is maybe not quite the right word but it's come down like that"
4084.800,4087.500," there's a Northern empowerment of Southern Empire in China at the time"
4088.500,4089.600," and the southern Empire"
4090.000,4092.000," is where buddy Dahmer arrives and there's a"
4093.100,4098.400," the Dynasty at that time was Leong and the particular emperor of that Dynasty was woo"
4098.900,4099.600," and woo"
4100.200,4103.000," had been an enthusiastic adopter of Buddhism"
4103.800,4107.800," he built temples he'd paid for translations of scriptures hit"
4108.300,4112.400," had a finance a lot of monastic it he'd done a lot for Buddhism"
4113.200,4114.100," so when he heard"
4114.700,4117.000," that this you know marvellously in light and master"
4117.800,4119.000," by repute"
4119.400,4120.100," by repute"
4120.500,4121.900," had arrived in China"
4122.400,4123.900," he immediately summoned him to"
4124.400,4125.800," to his court to sort of"
4126.400,4128.500," see how he could help now body Dharma"
4130.000,4131.400," was charged with"
4132.000,4132.300," helping"
4133.100,4134.700," this teaching he'd been"
4138.400,4140.600," I was going to say given that's not right because"
4141.100,4144.100," the discovery about who he was that he had made"
4144.700,4145.900," his teacher said"
4146.300,4147.100," Cher"
4147.500,4148.500," it share it in China"
4149.400,4153.700," so he goes to China and and he's invited to this person who loves Buddhism"
4154.100,4155.300," and would want to help him"
4156.100,4158.300," I did just the perfect person to me"
4158.600,4159.200," there is mission"
4159.800,4160.600," if you see what I mean like"
4161.200,4162.400," you know if you if you're trying to"
4164.500,4165.400," help some"
4166.000,4166.600," message"
4167.200,4167.900," spread"
4168.600,4171.600," in a you want to very wealthy powerful person"
4172.100,4175.800," is really enthusiastic enthusiastic about your message"
4176.600,4180.500," you know well that's that's What Every sort of non-profit dreams of right"
4181.900,4182.000," so"
4182.900,4183.600," here arrives"
4184.300,4186.100," goes to emperor wuss"
4186.800,4189.200," as follows that follows the invitation goes that"
4190.100,4193.900," and and they have this famous dialogue where The Empress says"
4194.600,4195.500," look at all the great"
4196.200,4198.400," works I've been doing on behalf of Buddhism"
4198.900,4200.100," how much merit"
4200.500,4201.000," have I"
4201.600,4202.100," acquired"
4202.800,4205.800," and merit is this at a notion of something like a moral"
4206.400,4207.000," bank account"
4207.900,4209.600," where the more good things you do the"
4209.900,4210.100," more"
4211.000,4212.000," the more tokens"
4213.100,4215.000," well we used to call brownie points you know"
4215.600,4217.300," you have in your moral bank account"
4217.900,4218.000," and"
4218.800,4220.700," it's part of this scheme of"
4221.500,4223.900," gradual development in"
4225.400,4228.500," Multiple lifetimes you've got enough merit in your bank account"
4228.800,4230.000," you cash it in"
4230.500,4231.100," a death"
4231.600,4233.100," and get a better Rebirth"
4234.000,4235.800," and they're keeping up like that you can keep"
4236.300,4240.500," getting higher and higher reaper meaning closer and closer to that blessed one"
4240.900,4242.800," when you can actually be a monastic you know"
4243.200,4244.500," and in fact woo was"
4245.300,4248.500," so keen on Buddhism that he tried to become a monastic"
4249.200,4250.600," and I think even did but then"
4251.600,4255.400," I can't remember the circumstances but he was required to come back to governing"
4256.100,4259.200," and so he and he would he lived in a very"
4260.000,4263.600," simple way with a sort of in a small room in the palace or something and"
4264.200,4267.300," try to send a balance being as devoted to practice as he could be"
4268.000,4268.500," while also"
4269.900,4270.700," being an active"
4271.000,4272.100," helpful governor"
4273.000,4273.800," of his lands"
4274.500,4279.400," but anyways there's so look at all good stuff I've done how much merit have I had been buddy dharma says"
4280.200,4281.100," none whatsoever"
4283.100,4283.700," so then"
4284.800,4285.400," woo"
4286.600,4291.200," is a bit taken aback you know but what about all this good stuff I've been doing so no no"
4291.800,4292.400," not at all"
4292.900,4293.200," then"
4293.800,4295.000," and then he says well"
4295.600,4295.900," okay"
4296.900,4298.800," Leaving that aside please tell me"
4299.500,4299.900," what is the"
4300.800,4302.800," highest teaching of holy truth"
4304.100,4304.700," like give me the"
4305.100,4305.800," core"
4306.500,4308.000," teaching of this marvelous"
4308.700,4310.400," practice in this marvellous wisdom"
4310.800,4311.900," what's the heart of it"
4312.700,4313.200," please tell me"
4314.400,4315.200," but it almost says"
4316.600,4317.800," no holy truth"
4319.300,4320.000," vast"
4320.200,4320.800," and clear"
4323.800,4324.900," or another translation"
4325.600,4327.300," across the vastness"
4328.500,4329.200," nothing holy"
4333.000,4334.200," Cross the vastness"
4335.300,4335.900," nothing holy"
4337.800,4339.300," so I think some sort of vision of a"
4339.900,4341.300," boundless openness"
4343.100,4344.100," which is itself"
4347.500,4347.700," and"
4351.400,4352.100," empty"
4352.800,4353.100," open"
4355.000,4356.400," infinitely spacious"
4360.000,4361.200," but is it somewhere else"
4363.200,4366.800," you know maybe in a backhand way buddy Darwin is actually giving"
4367.800,4369.700," why The Emperor's are for the teaching"
4371.800,4372.300," maybe"
4373.600,4374.000," right here"
4376.400,4377.300," right here now"
4379.300,4380.100," is vast"
4382.800,4383.200," there's actually"
4383.800,4384.200," funny enough"
4385.000,4386.500," when buddy Dahmer was training"
4387.500,4390.300," at us with his teacher president one point she asked him"
4392.400,4394.400," what is the biggest thing"
4395.600,4396.100," and he answers"
4397.200,4397.900," the Dharma"
4399.000,4399.900," there's nothing bigger"
4401.300,4403.400," the Dharma that is the biggest"
4404.200,4404.500," thing"
4406.200,4406.400," and then"
4406.900,4407.400," how big"
4407.900,4408.700," is the Dharma"
4412.500,4413.200," a little twig"
4415.200,4416.300," a single blade"
4416.700,4417.400," of grass"
4418.900,4419.900," that's how big it is"
4421.300,4422.000," that's how big"
4422.900,4423.600," the biggest thing"
4424.500,4424.700," is"
4431.600,4435.100," okay now I know I know I'm going off the deep end here"
4436.100,4436.400," and"
4438.600,4439.100," don't"
4440.600,4442.600," you know don't then be"
4444.100,4445.500," then be too concerned"
4445.800,4447.700," for me I'm okay you know but"
4448.300,4449.900," you know don't be too concerned radio"
4450.300,4451.900," yes I get getting this or not but"
4452.300,4453.500," could there be a way you know"
4454.100,4455.900," because I mean and maybe some of you have had some"
4456.600,4458.000," hints of this somehow"
4458.500,4459.000," isn't that"
4460.100,4462.800," a time you can remember when weirdly somehow"
4463.300,4463.800," you just got"
4464.300,4464.600," a light"
4465.000,4465.700," glimpse of"
4466.300,4467.500," a kind of holographic"
4468.300,4469.600," nature of things"
4470.100,4470.600," whereby"
4471.100,4471.900," one little thing"
4473.200,4475.000," actually was at somehow"
4476.000,4476.500," the hole"
4477.400,4479.600," it was showing everything like there's a"
4480.300,4484.400," I mean there's a mind-blowing teaching later from such as a"
4484.700,4486.000," great sort of compiler of"
4486.800,4488.300," Buddhists of Zen Buddhist"
4488.600,4490.000," Cohen's actually and he said"
4490.900,4492.400," it's so small"
4493.300,4494.400," there's nothing inside"
4495.900,4496.200," and"
4496.700,4498.000," it's so big"
4498.900,4499.600," there's nothing"
4500.500,4501.000," outside"
4502.600,4502.900," what"
4504.300,4504.600," is it"
4506.300,4507.000," that was such a"
4508.100,4509.100," what is it"
4513.200,4513.800," and you know"
4517.900,4522.700," we know you know we may know we may have some hint of the kind of answer and I was going to hold up a pen"
4523.200,4523.400," this"
4524.200,4524.800," pain is that"
4525.500,4526.300," some way"
4526.900,4530.200," there's a famous thing going all the teacher does is hold up one"
4530.900,4531.300," finger"
4532.400,4535.200," and what ever he's asked how big is the cosmos"
4537.400,4537.700," you know"
4538.300,4539.800," how old is the universe"
4542.700,4543.000," what"
4543.600,4543.900," is"
4544.700,4547.000," Awakening I I hear about it"
4547.600,4549.800," I want to I want to taste it for myself"
4553.900,4554.700," that's what it is"
4555.200,4555.800," you know I mean"
4556.700,4563.200," it may seem in scrutable and annoying even and Furious but but actually he's sincere about it"
4563.600,4564.800," because he's trying to share"
4565.200,4566.800," what he glimpse himself"
4567.300,4569.300," and his his personality structure"
4570.000,4571.500," had a moment of collapse"
4572.000,4572.800," that teacher when"
4573.500,4576.400," somebody showed another teacher held up their finger"
4577.200,4578.400," and at that instant"
4579.100,4582.900," this teacher is called he was called Henry who held up the finger"
4583.400,4585.000," when Judy saw"
4586.500,4587.400," that his whole world"
4588.300,4588.600," Fell"
4589.100,4589.600," over"
4590.000,4591.500," one boundless"
4592.200,4592.800," openness"
4593.700,4594.700," and he realised that"
4595.300,4596.500," every last thing"
4597.300,4599.200," is actually hologram Style"
4599.700,4600.600," is all of it"
4602.000,4604.900," each little thing so it's a really different way of"
4605.500,4606.600," experiencing but"
4607.000,4607.700," I'm guessing"
4608.300,4609.400," that some of us"
4609.900,4610.900," may be many of us"
4611.400,4613.400," have had some inkling when"
4613.900,4615.900," suddenly spaced and distance"
4616.500,4618.100," seemed to seem to vanish and"
4618.500,4620.000," it's only a glimpse but"
4620.400,4621.900," you have a certain sense"
4622.400,4622.800," sense of"
4624.000,4624.800," Everything's here"
4626.000,4626.700," everything's here"
4627.200,4628.200," is it's one"
4629.000,4629.600," phenomenon"
4630.300,4633.200," all these multiple things there's 10 trillion things"
4634.100,4635.100," somehow all"
4635.600,4636.700," one expression"
4637.300,4638.500," or there's one"
4639.200,4640.400," underlying fact"
4640.800,4641.800," that shows up"
4642.400,4643.400," as all these different things"
4644.700,4645.700," and you just get a"
4646.000,4646.700," glimpse of it"
4647.300,4648.800," a one mess"
4649.700,4651.300," you know you hear about it and"
4651.900,4653.400," basketball players and"
4653.700,4654.500," Surfers and"
4654.800,4655.700," pianists and"
4656.600,4656.700," you know"
4657.200,4658.100," it can happen and"
4658.900,4660.200," I mean and you know"
4662.000,4664.300," non extreme sport people none"
4664.800,4666.100," none musicians too"
4666.700,4668.900," we just get some sudden weird"
4669.600,4671.600," hits for no particular reason"
4672.300,4673.400," just out of nowhere"
4674.700,4676.600," a sudden sense that"
4678.200,4679.100," as another"
4680.600,4681.100," order"
4682.000,4683.100," behind all this"
4684.500,4686.000," where it isn't about"
4687.000,4688.600," me is the separate"
4689.000,4691.900," entity in this little skin bag"
4692.900,4694.300," and everything else out there"
4695.400,4699.400," and all of those things out there each being it's separate thing"
4700.600,4701.800," instead there's"
4703.000,4703.300," another"
4704.000,4704.400," order"
4706.400,4710.200," where in a way there isn't space in a way there isn't time"
4711.200,4713.600," in a way there isn't distance know that"
4714.200,4714.500," is"
4715.300,4715.500," what"
4716.500,4718.400," is meant by the term"
4718.900,4719.200," Buddha"
4720.000,4723.500," it's something or that's one aspect of it or one"
4723.800,4724.600," side of it"
4725.300,4726.700," one facet of it"
4727.200,4727.400," and"
4728.000,4729.800," it's also what"
4730.500,4730.700," is"
4731.200,4731.900," meant"
4732.500,4732.700," bye"
4734.200,4734.700," heart"
4735.400,4736.700," see the idea"
4738.100,4739.500," look into your own heart"
4739.700,4740.900," and find Buddha"
4741.700,4741.900," isn't"
4743.100,4744.300," look into your heart"
4745.300,4746.900," and rummage around in there"
4747.800,4749.200," and somewhere in there"
4749.900,4751.900," you're going to find this little statue"
4752.500,4753.400," called Buddha"
4753.900,4756.100," and that's going to be what Awakening is"
4757.100,4758.100," it's not that"
4759.100,4759.200," it's"
4760.000,4761.400," looking to your heart"
4763.700,4765.800," because your heart is"
4767.000,4767.600," Awakening"
4769.900,4772.800," your very own heart is Buddha"
4773.700,4773.800," now"
4775.300,4776.700," by the term heart"
4777.500,4777.900," let's just"
4778.700,4779.600," clarify a little bit"
4780.200,4781.500," what is being intended here"
4782.100,4783.100," the word is shin"
4784.000,4786.600," in Chinese which means both heart and mind"
4787.200,4788.300," doesn't separate the two"
4789.100,4789.800," so they're to"
4790.400,4792.600," seat of conscious experience or something like"
4794.600,4797.400," that and if we look into it we will find"
4801.000,4802.700," well as activity as"
4803.100,4804.300," the thoughts and feelings"
4804.700,4805.200," of course"
4806.400,4808.100," that are happening in that zone"
4809.200,4810.300," but then in a certain sense"
4810.600,4812.500," also all of our sense experience"
4813.200,4814.400," is happening in that zone"
4816.100,4816.700," because it all"
4819.500,4820.900," it's all lived bye"
4822.000,4822.600," consciousness"
4824.100,4826.300," it's all happening within consciousness"
4829.200,4831.600," by the way hearing a car watching a cargo buy"
4832.200,4833.100," driving a car"
4833.700,4834.700," going to the supermarket"
4835.400,4839.000," you know everything that we experienced is happening in in consciousness"
4839.800,4839.900," in"
4840.800,4841.300," shin"
4841.700,4842.300," so shin"
4843.900,4845.400," is not just"
4846.600,4848.200," the zone of emotion"
4851.800,4852.900," it's more than that"
4855.000,4855.500," and if we"
4856.900,4858.900," just rest with it"
4859.600,4861.000," without trying to change it"
4862.200,4863.900," just letting it be as it is"
4865.600,4867.000," we can start to discover"
4868.000,4870.500," for example as you know I don't know whether"
4871.000,4871.900," as well I was trying to"
4872.400,4874.500," see if this might help in our sit actually to"
4875.100,4875.500," discover"
4876.200,4881.200," then maybe traces of habituated feeling emotion tone"
4881.800,4884.600," which may really be nothing more than muscular"
4886.900,4889.200," sensitivities muscular habits"
4890.200,4890.700," subtle"
4891.300,4891.900," muscular"
4894.300,4895.200," Vibrations"
4896.000,4899.100," vibro will witness or quite the word but you know what I mean like"
4899.700,4901.500," subtle muscular sensations"
4902.800,4903.700," and we're so used to"
4904.700,4906.600," interpreting them as oh that's"
4907.500,4909.600," that's how it feels to be me or something like that"
4910.700,4914.800," but that actually we can just if we can just let them be there without interpreting anything"
4917.400,4918.800," that can help to open up"
4920.100,4921.100," a sense of space"
4923.200,4923.600," right there"
4924.200,4927.700," in the heart zone in other words chest diaphragm area"
4928.800,4929.300," more or less"
4930.000,4931.600," but then we can see how that space"
4932.500,4934.300," actually is indistinguishable"
4935.800,4937.100," from all the space"
4939.900,4940.700," that isn't really"
4941.400,4943.100," either in us or outside us"
4943.600,4944.600," but is the space"
4945.900,4946.500," in which"
4947.500,4949.000," all are experienced"
4950.100,4950.700," is a rising"
4953.800,4954.700," and that space"
4955.900,4957.700," doesn't actually have size"
4959.400,4961.800," it's not really space is actually"
4962.900,4963.600," awareness"
4968.200,4969.000," and that awareness"
4971.200,4971.800," holds everything"
4974.500,4975.600," and that awareness is"
4976.700,4979.100," when we just start to get a flavour of it"
4980.000,4982.800," of the boundless awareness it's very sweet"
4984.000,4984.600," it's very"
4985.400,4985.900," lovely"
4987.800,4990.500," it's got a weird kind of warped to it"
4991.400,4993.000," almost got a little buzz"
4993.500,4993.800," in it"
4997.200,4999.300," and then eliminates distance and it's"
5000.300,5002.400," actually in and of itself it's empty"
5005.400,5007.800," when they're all this stuff arises in it"
5008.700,5009.900," it vibrations of"
5011.700,5012.700," are which a sound"
5013.600,5014.900," vibrations of light"
5015.800,5017.700," light undulations of light which are"
5018.600,5019.900," colours and shapes and objects"
5021.000,5024.300," you know it's all arising all this experience is arising"
5025.700,5026.200," in"
5028.100,5029.300," awareness itself"
5031.000,5032.400," and that awareness itself"
5034.100,5037.000," is not bound by our cranium"
5037.400,5038.300," or by our body"
5040.100,5040.400," and that's"
5041.100,5041.500," actually"
5043.300,5043.500," sort of"
5044.100,5044.600," Shin"
5044.800,5045.500," that's what shin"
5046.600,5046.800," is"
5050.200,5051.000," so by Looking In"
5051.500,5052.800," to our experience"
5053.900,5056.200," inward experience we can find"
5061.800,5062.200," the hole"
5063.900,5065.100," be awareness that is all"
5069.100,5071.200," but maybe that is exactly the mother"
5071.800,5072.100," of all"
5076.800,5079.200," so when great practitioners Awakened to that"
5079.700,5081.300," and become known as buddhas"
5082.500,5083.100," death"
5084.300,5086.700," that their sons and Daughters their children of"
5090.600,5090.900," the mother"
5102.700,5104.300," let me just look at my notes for a second"
5105.100,5105.800," but"
5111.200,5111.400," yeah"
5120.200,5122.700," well look we're gonna I'm Gonna Stop"
5123.600,5125.500," in a just a second but"
5126.000,5128.200," I want to say and so I'm just going to have a quick"
5128.800,5129.900," quick quick quick look at the notes"
5135.600,5139.400," I didn't know that about the City Slickers movie that's great to hear"
5139.900,5140.600," and thanks for the"
5141.200,5144.200," I like that emoji I want to find that one that's great"
5145.100,5146.200," okay- lovely"
5146.600,5147.200," lovely okay"
5149.100,5149.100," um"
5151.200,5152.100," yeah okay"
5153.700,5158.100," and somebody said they like they like the smile it's not always mentioned my coach okay that's great"
5158.500,5158.700," yeah"
5159.100,5160.900," so let me just I just want to say"
5162.600,5164.600," I want to say something about Palestine"
5164.900,5169.000," just before we close and I'm before I close and I want to try to keep it really brief"
5169.300,5174.200," I went to a really great event yesterday online I don't know whether anybody else went to it with Rabbi Lin"
5175.200,5176.100," from Albuquerque"
5176.800,5178.600," she was talking about"
5180.200,5181.500," how to"
5183.300,5185.600," she's she's been aware of"
5186.900,5188.900," the realities of palestine's"
5190.200,5193.100," for most of her life she visited as a teenager"
5193.700,5195.800," she's a you know An American Jewish rabbi"
5196.400,5198.200," and has been working to try to"
5200.000,5201.100," promote healing"
5201.600,5201.700," you know"
5202.300,5203.000," and and"
5203.500,5203.900," her"
5204.100,5205.700," this was the teaching she had"
5206.200,5207.000," in a nutshell"
5209.900,5210.600," healing"
5211.400,5212.100," can't happen"
5213.200,5214.300," without awareness"
5214.900,5215.900," of the wound"
5217.900,5218.500," the problem"
5218.900,5219.200," in"
5222.500,5224.000," in the Jewish world"
5225.200,5226.500," not just in Israel but"
5226.800,5228.000," very much in America"
5229.100,5230.900," and also in other countries"
5231.600,5233.700," but particularly in America where the"
5234.500,5236.400," Israeli lobby has been so powerful"
5237.100,5237.500," for the last"
5238.200,5239.700," 70 or years"
5240.600,5241.100," is that"
5242.300,5244.300," you can't get to awareness"
5245.300,5246.400," the first step"
5247.400,5247.700," for"
5248.200,5248.700," healing"
5249.500,5253.000," you can't get there because the forces of what she called denialism"
5253.600,5254.200," are so strong"
5255.400,5258.900," so the first step for all of us is to get educated"
5259.900,5261.600," to know the actual history"
5262.100,5263.400," because there's a lot of people"
5264.100,5264.600," Jews"
5265.400,5266.300," who still think"
5267.000,5269.700," that what was said about Palestine in"
5270.200,5272.100," the late forties was true"
5272.700,5274.100," that it was a land without people"
5275.000,5277.100," going to quote for people without a land"
5278.200,5278.300," and"
5279.000,5283.100," we should buy now all be aware that that's a lie"
5283.700,5284.300," that was not"
5284.800,5287.500," an accurate description it was a throwaway"
5288.500,5289.000," phrase"
5289.700,5291.000," buy a colonial power"
5291.700,5293.500," that for his own convenience"
5294.000,5296.700," wanted to move a certain people into a certain area"
5297.500,5300.200," and as colonial imperial powers are always done"
5301.600,5303.500," basically indigenous people don't exist"
5304.200,5305.500," because they're inconvenient"
5306.200,5308.200," you know so you either kill them or you move them"
5308.900,5311.000," and the British Empire did a lot of Killing"
5311.400,5312.400," of indigenous people"
5313.100,5315.500," and in the case of Palestine it moved people"
5317.700,5317.900," and"
5319.400,5323.300," the reality is that for 7576 years"
5324.700,5325.000," now"
5325.600,5325.700," you know"
5326.400,5329.200," there's been a colonial occupation going on there"
5329.900,5332.000," and you can't really have a conversation"
5333.100,5333.300," about"
5334.900,5335.300," why"
5336.600,5338.900," the people who are very very upset about"
5340.200,5342.500," the Slaughter going on in Gaza"
5343.100,5345.600," you can't have a conversation about why they're so upset"
5346.400,5347.400," if you're not"
5348.200,5348.700," yet"
5349.800,5352.600," even able to set the records straight"
5353.700,5354.500," and actually"
5355.400,5356.300," unpack"
5357.400,5359.000," the denialism around it"
5359.900,5360.700," denialism"
5361.600,5364.100," is I think one step further than denial"
5364.600,5366.300," is deny is denying"
5366.900,5368.600," and then denying that there's denying"
5369.800,5370.600," you know so"
5370.900,5371.200," so"
5371.600,5374.100," I read a long article in the New York Times"
5376.300,5377.100," on Friday"
5378.000,5379.500," about of course they've been"
5379.700,5381.900," a dozens and dozens of the New York Times and everywhere"
5382.400,5383.600," about the compass"
5384.500,5386.600," in the encampments in universities and so on"
5387.300,5391.200," and you know if you read a long article it's supposed to be going in depth about it"
5391.600,5394.300," but not once does it mention the word occupation"
5395.400,5398.500," and not once does it mention the word nqaba"
5399.300,5401.500," which is the Arabic term for the catastrophe"
5402.500,5402.600," that"
5403.400,5405.200," Palestinians went through in 1948"
5405.700,5407.300," if you don't mention those things"
5407.900,5409.500," you're obviously not yet"
5410.100,5413.200," on a kind of impartial playing field where"
5413.600,5414.500," was not a playing field but"
5415.800,5418.100," a place where you can start to have"
5418.700,5420.200," a reasonable discussion about it"
5420.700,5421.400," because he haven't"
5422.500,5425.200," actually acknowledged the reality of the situation though"
5426.000,5426.100," so"
5427.600,5429.500," I'm really just wanting to"
5430.100,5432.300," applaud this Rabbi Lynn"
5432.800,5434.400," for doing the work she does"
5436.400,5441.500," and for everybody who's doing that work which is it's non-violent"
5442.200,5444.300," is the work of trying to bring"
5445.800,5446.400," tr"
5451.300,5455.100," needs to be done you think that it's easy enough to get the information"
5456.000,5456.600," but it's not"
5457.300,5459.000," you know there's been a very potent"
5459.600,5460.900," lobby in this country"
5461.800,5462.900," that has perpetuated"
5464.100,5464.800," the myths"
5466.000,5468.800," that you know just doesn't want the narrative to be"
5469.900,5470.200," told"
5471.700,5472.800," what really happened"
5473.200,5475.900," you know and what really is happening it's like it's like"
5476.500,5477.800," trying to have a conversation with"
5478.800,5482.400," you know about South Africa and the days of a part I"
5483.100,5484.600," without acknowledging that"
5485.500,5486.700," there's a part I going on"
5487.500,5489.100," you know it's it's it's it's"
5489.600,5489.900," anyway"
5491.300,5493.500," this is actually part of body dahmer's message"
5494.000,5495.700," is part of prag message"
5496.300,5499.700," that looking in also means looking"
5500.900,5501.900," into the world"
5502.600,5503.600," it means looking"
5504.500,5505.400," and knowing"
5506.400,5509.700," you know more clearly seeing more clearly what's going on"
5510.500,5512.500," and that's not an automatic thing"
5513.200,5515.200," that we just should be able to do now"
5515.400,5516.500," we have to come here"
5517.500,5521.200," we have to come and get get educated you know we have we have a"
5521.900,5522.800," we have a responsibility"
5524.200,5525.200," to to learn"
5528.000,5528.600," and then"
5529.000,5529.700," and then we can"
5531.200,5531.700," and then we can"
5533.000,5535.400," you know be on the side of non-harmful"
5538.000,5539.400," this is a practice of non"
5542.000,5543.000," that we're engaged in"
5543.700,5545.100," this is we're really trying to"
5548.400,5549.200," turn back"
5549.900,5550.500," from harming"
5552.500,5552.600," and"
5553.900,5555.600," you know we're who are there somebody"
5556.500,5557.700," I heard about recently Who"
5558.800,5560.100," yeah to be a universalist"
5560.500,5561.400," the universalist"
5562.500,5564.100," your Pro everybody"
5565.500,5565.800," actually"
5566.700,5567.300," that's how we"
5568.400,5569.800," that's how we undercut"
5570.200,5570.900," the humanising"
5572.600,5573.700," as being for"
5574.400,5575.200," All Humans"
5576.600,5577.100," and that means"
5578.400,5579.300," non harming"
5580.100,5581.000," as a first step"
5584.700,5584.700," so"
5586.500,5586.800," let's"
5588.100,5589.800," let's all do our part"
5590.000,5590.200," to"
5594.100,5594.300," that's"
5595.000,5597.100," all dough up I'm just looking at the notes here"
5598.800,5600.700," yeah indeed I mean there's that's"
5601.400,5602.300," that's right the"
5603.300,5606.400," I don't know about the lobby is continued to travel just about"
5607.000,5607.900," maybe I don't know"
5609.400,5609.700," yeah"
5610.100,5613.500," I meant it in a very specific political cents political lobbying"
5614.400,5614.800," but anyway"
5615.800,5617.600," it's it's a hot issue I know"
5618.800,5621.100," somebody saying I didn't come here for politics but"
5621.500,5622.100," well okay"
5624.300,5624.600," but"
5625.100,5630.400," um being non harming being four Non harming"
5631.000,5631.500," I think is"
5632.900,5634.200," is actually part of our practice"
5635.600,5636.200," you know so"
5637.800,5639.800," let's anyway let's"
5641.300,5642.800," let's let's all"
5645.400,5645.900," try to"
5647.700,5649.600," be as well informed as we can be"
5652.300,5652.400," okay"
5653.500,5653.600," now"
5654.900,5656.100," let's go into some questions"
5656.800,5657.500," Vanessa"
5662.400,5666.000," if you'd like to unmute okay thank you great to see you"
5668.300,5669.300," you're muted"
5670.300,5671.000," can you unmute"
5672.400,5677.300," Henry I'm really sorry I put my hand up by mistake I don't have a question okay"
5679.000,5680.000," we're lovely to see you"
5680.300,5681.800," lovely to see it hi Dan"
5689.000,5691.000," yeah when you're ready just"
5692.000,5692.400," go ahead"
5693.000,5695.500," I actually I did mean to raise my hand but also this way bye"
5697.200,5698.200," so I had a question"
5700.200,5704.600," I'm not exactly neuroscientist but I've recently learned about polyvagal Theory"
5705.100,5707.100," which I don't know if you've heard about that"
5708.900,5711.500," and one of the things that struck me as someone who is"
5712.100,5714.500," a meditator and learning both the heart mind"
5715.100,5719.000," is about how the ventral V big vagus connects to the heart"
5719.800,5720.700," and sometimes"
5721.600,5725.300," my limited experience with meditation and samadhi States and things like that"
5726.000,5728.300," if feels like this dropping away of"
5728.800,5730.100," of the me but more"
5730.700,5731.700," the thinking mind"
5732.200,5733.800," and I wonder if there's something"
5734.500,5736.100," not to reduce"
5736.700,5737.600," the beauty of"
5738.200,5739.700," these kinds of moments but"
5741.500,5742.600," if part of it is simply"
5743.100,5746.700," an adoption of total Safety and kind of resignation to"
5747.400,5748.300," the ventral vagus"
5749.300,5752.100," if there's something to that and not to"
5752.800,5756.200," going to politics or anything like that sometimes I wonder what you're talking about"
5757.800,5759.200," with Israel and Palestine"
5759.700,5761.800," I see from a different perspective I'm also"
5762.400,5764.200," of Jewish background like yourself but"
5764.700,5766.000," that there's so much pain"
5766.500,5768.300," for everyone on all sides"
5768.900,5772.100," and I read something by Tara Brach recently"
5772.700,5776.900," and she was saying that there's the the pain that's very difficult to uncle cling"
5777.600,5780.000," from for israelis who still feel very hurt"
5780.500,5782.900," and of course Palestinians who are undergoing"
5783.600,5785.300," whatever one might think of Hamas"
5785.600,5788.700," the regular Palestinian civilian who is being bombed"
5789.200,5790.800," that they have so much pain also"
5791.500,5795.500," and that there's just so much pain for everyone and they're in this constant"
5796.100,5801.000," dangerous state their sympathetic nervous system even their dorsal vagus is activated"
5801.600,5802.000," um"
5802.600,5807.500," and not to go into that but that it seems to connect to everything for all of us how do we get to this"
5807.900,5811.400," place of safety is it something so simple and yet so big of just"
5812.100,5814.100," can can we resigned to just"
5814.900,5818.800," just the heart just the ventral vagus and whatever is going on just getting into"
5819.500,5820.700," into the moment and just"
5821.500,5825.100," just accepting just this whatever this isn't this this piece"
5825.600,5827.000," regardless of what's going on"
5828.000,5829.100," yeah yes yes yes"
5829.900,5832.700," we'll look there's a I think there's two things that I mean what first- of all"
5833.500,5834.700," doubt lists there are"
5835.000,5838.400," for sure there are neural or neurological correlates"
5839.200,5840.400," for sure to what we"
5841.000,5842.100," experience in meditation"
5843.000,5843.200," and"
5844.300,5845.800," whether it's you know how the"
5847.600,5852.500," the cause anality works I don't know in a weather is because we're doing a certain practice"
5853.200,5856.300," and that is dialling down the ventral vagal"
5856.800,5857.800," part of the nervous system"
5859.500,5863.700," and bringing it into a place of safety that then allows us to go into"
5864.600,5867.500," account whatever whatever kind of samadhi it might be that"
5867.900,5870.000," has that larger sense of safety in it"
5870.400,5871.700," I mean all weather"
5872.700,5874.300," it's the other way around you know"
5874.800,5876.000," we're doing a practice and"
5877.100,5878.000," we're we're actually following"
5879.700,5881.500," certain sequence of"
5884.100,5886.800," intentions in practice and they're bringing on"
5887.800,5888.700," say to somebody"
5889.500,5889.900," and that"
5891.300,5893.400," brings us into a place of great safety"
5894.600,5896.900," and the ventral of angle system responds"
5897.500,5898.400," accordingly you know"
5899.100,5900.900," I don't really know which way around it is"
5901.400,5902.400," but I agree with you that"
5902.900,5906.300," safety is is a is a part of the experience and"
5908.000,5912.800," I would say that I mean I'm not sure whether this is exactly what you are asking but"
5913.500,5914.600," that isn't there something"
5915.600,5917.100," of that safety"
5917.900,5920.200," in all the different levels of"
5921.200,5925.400," shift that we can find in practice you know in mindfulness when we"
5926.400,5927.600," when we come to"
5928.700,5931.300," a real deep mindfulness you know where"
5932.100,5932.400," where"
5932.900,5935.700," able to be aware of all our experience right now"
5936.700,5938.200," without any resisting"
5938.800,5940.100," and basically loving it all"
5940.800,5942.100," there's a kind of safety there"
5942.800,5945.500," and then there's then there's also the safety of"
5946.500,5947.000," of the"
5948.300,5951.100," body dharma and prize letter of that"
5951.600,5952.600," they're cannot"
5952.900,5957.000," in a way in a certain level I mean this is pretty radical but on certain level"
5957.700,5960.600," there's no place of non safety from their perspective"
5960.800,5962.000," because the whole thing"
5962.500,5963.600," is one heart"
5964.200,5964.500," you know"
5965.600,5965.800," and"
5966.700,5971.300," just let me just break down let me just come back to what you're saying about the"
5972.300,5973.600," Israel Palestine I mean"
5974.400,5978.800," I I love what Tara Bright has to say on it so anything she says I agree with"
5979.600,5980.000," you know and"
5980.600,5983.700," and I I don't mean to be saying that there isn't"
5984.100,5987.700," you know this isn't also a terribly difficult situation for Israel"
5988.500,5991.400," I'm I'm really saying that part of the healing"
5992.600,5993.600," just has to be"
5994.400,5996.600," I think can't happen without"
5998.100,6002.400," a broader understanding of the condition the causes and conditions"
6003.000,6003.200," you know"
6004.200,6004.800," and so"
6005.900,6009.800," to to think it began on it began on October the 7th"
6010.600,6013.300," because it was just a terrible terrible day"
6014.200,6017.900," and yes there are still people taking hostage and yes"
6018.800,6020.100," 1,200 people were murdered"
6021.100,6021.500," but the"
6022.000,6022.300," you know"
6023.000,6025.200," the in no way diminishing that"
6026.300,6027.700," to also recognise"
6028.800,6029.900," the circumstances"
6030.300,6030.900," in which"
6031.800,6032.700," that event"
6033.300,6033.800," occurred"
6034.000,6034.400," you know which"
6034.900,6035.500," have a long"
6036.300,6036.600," free"
6037.200,6037.800," pre-history"
6038.700,6039.200," you know and"
6040.100,6043.600," it's it's you know there's a very tangle thing"
6044.100,6046.300," it's a very difficult tangle situation"
6047.500,6048.300," but taking it"
6049.400,6052.400," without taking a broader view of it is really"
6054.100,6056.300," it's really hard to see how"
6057.200,6058.300," healing can"
6058.900,6059.800," be reached"
6060.200,6060.400," you know"
6061.500,6064.100," that we my main perspective but anyway"
6064.900,6065.000," you know"
6066.400,6067.400," this is just as a"
6068.200,6069.700," ignorant practitioner you know"
6070.900,6071.400," trying to"
6072.500,6073.400," trying to understand"
6074.200,6075.300," is very difficult things and"
6076.600,6079.900," sticking to one thing non harm really"
6081.300,6082.900," a set of now Janice hi"
6091.000,6091.300," hi"
6092.000,6094.000," momentarily got lost in your words"
6096.300,6101.900," recently I was in Ireland at the and visited"
6102.500,6102.700," the"
6103.700,6104.700," library at Trinity"
6105.600,6106.600," with the great hall"
6107.600,6108.400," and saw"
6109.900,6114.000," four statues of women that had recently been placed there in that"
6115.300,6116.300," Bastion of"
6117.400,6119.300," of male writings okay"
6120.300,6120.400," and"
6121.900,6124.200," now today I come to this wonderful"
6127.100,6129.000," meditation and teaching"
6129.700,6133.100," and I hear about volition atarra"
6134.100,6134.400," and"
6135.700,6138.300," I have not ever known about her"
6139.200,6139.500," and"
6140.600,6141.100," it just"
6141.800,6143.700," it just is so moving to me"
6145.000,6146.300," to think that"
6147.100,6151.500," all that her story is only told through that of her"
6152.700,6153.500," of her student"
6154.300,6155.500," and I am wondering"
6156.400,6161.800," I'll give an everything that you know about you know this lineage and and all of this"
6162.700,6163.300," um"
6165.800,6173.800," how it is is it is it possible to even know of her full story and what her teachings were"
6174.300,6176.700," you know as much as we know about the Budd"
6177.800,6182.400," is is that possible-- and it seems to me also in the context of what"
6183.000,6184.400," you have been discussing here"
6185.200,6189.300," that the bow that there is up there is a necessary balancing"
6190.100,6191.600," that needs to happen in"
6192.200,6194.100," in our world in the Zen world"
6194.500,6196.500," and in the world at large"
6197.000,6201.600," with the forced with only the four statues among 40 or something"
6202.600,6208.200," other male statues in that wonderful library with the great ball of guy in there now"
6208.600,6209.400," mother Earth"
6211.100,6212.800," is is there a way for that"
6213.200,6218.500," to be the the topic of an hour of talk"
6219.300,6222.300," so that's my question yes yes thank you"
6222.900,6223.400," thank you so much"
6225.300,6226.800," well I was trying to bring"
6227.700,6231.200," the the you know the feminine in more and"
6231.800,6233.200," through its predator and through"
6234.200,6236.500," the way that there wasn't acknowledgement of"
6237.200,6239.800," this cosmic mother you know"
6240.400,6242.000," but I agree with you I mean the"
6242.600,6242.800," the"
6244.200,6249.700," what I know of and that I've taught from over the years is a book called The Hidden lamp"
6251.000,6254.600," and there's hidden lamp because it's the passing on of the wisdom"
6255.500,6257.300," of women teachers in"
6258.300,6259.700," Buddhism and in Zen"
6260.600,6260.700," and"
6261.800,6263.900," I think there is a redressing needed"
6264.900,6265.400," for sure"
6268.400,6270.300," and that's partly why I'm not"
6270.700,6274.600," actually myself teaching traditional zen the way I used to"
6275.700,6276.400," because it was"
6278.500,6279.500," it was such a"
6281.200,6282.700," explicitly male"
6283.200,6283.700," lineage"
6284.700,6288.700," and you know and a lot of injustice is encoded in that"
6289.600,6290.700," you know because there were"
6291.600,6293.600," people like project Tara you know"
6295.700,6296.700," turned into a map"
6301.100,6302.400," so thank you for bringing that up"
6303.200,6304.000," and I I think"
6308.500,6311.300," I think modern Western Buddhism"
6312.200,6314.000," generally has tried"
6314.900,6315.900," has been trying"
6316.900,6317.700," to redress"
6318.500,6320.500," the balance at least in its own"
6321.000,6322.300," ranx so to speak"
6323.000,6324.200," that there are way more"
6325.600,6326.000," public"
6326.600,6327.600," women teachers"
6328.600,6329.000," you know then"
6330.500,6331.800," there have been historically"
6333.000,6334.900," today in the west in I think in"
6335.900,6336.900," certainly in Zen"
6337.400,6337.800," if you"
6339.400,6340.900," you know if you look at other"
6342.500,6346.100," traditions I don't know I don't know so well but I believe so"
6346.600,6346.700," you know"
6351.400,6352.100," I think it's a"
6354.600,6355.600," it's important that we"
6357.000,6359.300," we do that Janice thank you for bringing it up"
6360.700,6360.900," yeah"
6362.900,6363.000," and"
6364.100,6367.400," if anybody has any suggestions for these gatherings"
6368.200,6368.500," on that"
6369.200,6371.000," school let me know please will let us know"
6371.700,6372.600," yeah Greg hi"
6376.200,6377.000," hi Henry thanks"
6378.100,6381.600," um so my question I guess the thrust of my question is"
6383.500,6387.800," is this too good to be true awareness when you spoke about"
6388.700,6390.500," how kind of settling back into awareness"
6391.500,6397.200," you know there's a warmth and a buzzing and you know a feeling of Tenderness and love"
6399.300,6405.200," the in my mind some alarm bells go off kind of thinking like wait a minute is too good to be true"
6405.900,6411.600," and I'm attracted to teachers that are on the sceptical side like you and Sam Harris and other people that"
6412.300,6414.600," you know look at things I would say through"
6416.100,6416.500," you know"
6417.200,6419.600," not a dogmatic religious point of view and"
6421.200,6423.900," but it just it strikes me as odd that"
6424.600,6426.800," potentially the center of reality"
6427.900,6428.800," seems to have this"
6429.500,6431.900," you know positive valence to it"
6432.600,6439.600," and for me for me I definitely can step back into awareness and I felt that way during the"
6441.000,6441.700," initial sit"
6442.100,6446.800," for me personally in a maybe it's just where I'm in on the path it has a neutral"
6447.300,6448.900," feeling it's just kind of feel the neutral"
6450.900,6452.000,"and anyway I just"
6452.600,6460.100," you know I guess part of my question is is there's doubt in my mind but it just it seems too good to be true that really everything's love and"
6460.600,6460.800," and"
6462.000,6464.200," anyway yeah just kind of is it too good to be true"
6465.500,6469.700," honestly I would say just keep exploring for yourself"
6470.500,6472.200," and trust your own experience"
6472.800,6474.000," don't take anything for granted"
6475.600,6476.300," I find"
6477.900,6479.300," that one of my"
6479.900,6481.700," points of recognition or"
6482.700,6485.500," indicating that I am dropping back into"
6486.100,6488.900," a more inclusive awareness so why do more inclusive awareness"
6489.900,6490.300," is that"
6490.900,6495.300," there's some sort of response perhaps it's just my own response to it"
6496.000,6496.900," the feels"
6497.500,6500.800," like a belonging like a gratitude like a relief"
6501.400,6502.400," that has positive"
6503.300,6503.800," affects"
6504.200,6504.600," for sure"
6505.500,6507.600," I find that man I think it makes sense really because"
6508.500,6509.000," it's a"
6510.000,6511.200," it comes with a"
6511.800,6513.100," letting go"
6513.600,6513.800," of"
6516.800,6519.000," the intrinsically anxious"
6520.600,6521.800," ordinary sense of self"
6523.300,6525.900," as David Lloyd has said the self"
6526.800,6528.000," is always anxious"
6528.900,6532.800," is anxious about many things you know out in the world and in its life"
6533.600,6535.900," but our fundamentally it's anxious"
6537.800,6539.500," about whether or not it really exists"
6543.600,6547.500," good take that again take that as you like and I think all these things are"
6548.100,6548.300," not"
6549.800,6552.500," up for grabs you know it's not like"
6553.200,6553.900," I would if I say"
6554.400,6556.300," as I just did like check it out for yourself"
6556.800,6557.400," I don't mean"
6558.500,6560.500," check it out and you'll come to the same conclusion"
6561.200,6563.000," I just mean check it out for yourself"
6563.600,6563.900," you know"
6564.600,6564.900," I'm"
6565.600,6567.700," relaying the best I can what I find"
6568.500,6570.500," that there does always seem to be"
6571.300,6571.700," yeah"
6572.600,6573.500," a pretty powerful"
6574.100,6574.600," positive"
6575.400,6575.900," affect"
6578.100,6578.200," you know"
6579.400,6582.700," yeah yeah yeah okay no that makes sense to me it's just the"
6583.200,6586.800," letting go of these condition patterns and that just brings a sense of relief"
6587.500,6587.900," and it's not"
6588.600,6589.000," Yeah Yeah"
6589.600,6591.400," and the fact that it's okay to do that"
6592.100,6594.300," which you know the condition patterns didn't realise"
6597.500,6599.100," yeah okay hey thanks a lot"
6599.500,6599.800," Paul"
6607.100,6608.900," and wait if you can unmute pull we're not"
6609.400,6609.900," hearing yet"
6610.600,6612.100," thanks sorry"
6612.700,6616.200," yeah thank you so much for the Teachings today Henry and"
6616.800,6617.300," and and"
6618.100,6620.500," for so long now that I've been fortunate to be"
6622.200,6624.800," here in Your presence and I wanted to say that"
6625.700,6628.700," the last bit of what you were speaking about"
6631.100,6632.000," with Palestine"
6632.700,6633.800," is absolutely"
6634.600,6636.300," and completely consistent with"
6637.100,6638.500," the whole first part of this"
6640.000,6640.900," this session"
6641.600,6643.300," there's no difference everything included"
6644.700,6644.900," and"
6645.600,6647.700," I wanted to share about that in a very"
6649.600,6650.600," personal practice way"
6651.700,6652.600," last October"
6653.500,6653.700," when"
6654.200,6656.500," this all started happening in the Middle East"
6656.800,6658.100," this current round"
6658.900,6660.200," and going on for quite a while but"
6662.800,6664.300,"uh of course sitting with the suffering"
6664.600,6665.500," of the oppressed"
6667.300,6669.000," and I found I was picking and choosing"
6671.000,6672.200," and I couldn't sit"
6672.900,6674.000," only for the oppressed"
6675.100,6676.600," in this case the Palestinians"
6677.300,6680.900," I had to sit for with an as the oppressed"
6681.500,6683.500," in this case the Palestinians and"
6684.700,6686.200," I had to sit for with"
6686.800,6689.500," and as the oppressor in this instance"
6691.200,6691.600," Israel"
6693.700,6695.400," and that broke my heart open"
6697.500,6698.600," and then I could understand"
6700.500,6702.000," I could really be in this moment"
6703.600,6704.900," as beautiful as it is"
6705.800,6707.100," as painful as it is"
6708.200,6709.000," but complete"
6709.700,6710.400," and not choosing"
6711.700,6712.600," and that's really"
6713.800,6715.000," a fruit of this practice"
6715.900,6718.500," and the promises you make in terms of"
6719.600,6721.800," how life changing original love is"
6722.200,6723.200," so thank you so much"
6724.400,6728.300," well thank you said it better than I could ever say thank you you got it"
6728.700,6729.100," you got it"
6729.500,6729.800," thank you"
6730.400,6732.300," that's that's exactly what"
6734.300,6736.300," at my best I'm hoping to convey"
6737.100,6737.400," thank you"
6738.800,6739.000," thank you"
6739.700,6741.300," Simon will let's let's"
6743.100,6743.200," please"
6743.900,6744.100," yeah"
6746.700,6747.800," hi Harry"
6748.200,6750.400," first go thank you for your teaching"
6751.800,6753.400," yeah they have helped me a lot"
6754.200,6756.000," so actually I'm now very"
6756.500,6757.900," clear with my question"
6758.900,6760.700," I'm not sure how to constructively"
6762.300,6762.500," the"
6763.300,6765.400," you mentioned about resistance"
6766.200,6766.600," and"
6767.600,6769.500," I know that's something that we"
6770.000,6773.300," encounter often in meditation"
6774.100,6775.200," of course"
6775.800,6777.700," even more often in daylight"
6778.700,6779.000," and"
6779.500,6780.900," I heard a saying"
6781.800,6783.700," that to the resist anything"
6784.300,6786.000," it to the resist everything"
6787.500,6787.800," and"
6788.800,6789.800," why I heard it I"
6790.500,6792.500," I resonated with it"
6794.000,6794.600," so much"
6795.700,6796.200," however"
6796.700,6798.600," I still don't clearly"
6799.000,6799.600," stand"
6800.300,6804.700," what exactly it mean but I feel there is so much to choose the internet"
6805.700,6806.600," um that's"
6807.500,6809.800," one hand but on the other hand"
6812.400,6813.300," yeah I know"
6813.600,6818.200," we're talking about to politics I'm not in a position to make any"
6818.400,6820.900," comment about it and I don't intend to"
6822.600,6824.600," for me personally"
6825.700,6827.200," I have wrestled with"
6828.100,6830.200," the idea what just is there"
6831.000,6833.400," not Injustice for many many years"
6834.900,6838.000," and recently somehow I decided"
6839.400,6840.400," to drop it as"
6842.000,6843.300," as much as a kid"
6845.100,6846.400," I I feel that"
6848.000,6849.800," it has been very important"
6851.000,6851.800," very for me"
6852.500,6853.500," until"
6854.800,6855.000," you know"
6855.500,6856.400," until no longer"
6857.300,6857.600," and"
6858.100,6858.500," I just"
6859.100,6859.600," about"
6860.800,6861.700," I'm feeling that"
6862.300,6863.400," it is important"
6864.600,6865.600," as I understand it"
6866.100,6866.800," understand it"
6867.700,6870.000," just is the sense of Justice"
6870.500,6871.100," green people"
6872.400,6873.800," the sense of safety"
6875.200,6876.900," and in Justice"
6877.700,6879.900," tend to make a people feel"
6880.700,6882.300," that they are not loved"
6883.400,6884.800," their appended"
6885.500,6887.700," their eyes are abandoned by their story"
6888.100,6891.700," the authority can be a government or just the teacher when they're Young"
6893.100,6896.000," any people who had the kind of power seemed to have the"
6896.700,6897.500," kind of power"
6898.600,6899.800," over themselves"
6900.800,6901.100," and"
6902.600,6903.300," they tend to"
6903.900,6906.600," believe that if in just the"
6907.300,6908.100," their treating"
6908.600,6908.700," just"
6909.400,6909.500," with"
6910.000,6911.100," injustice they"
6912.000,6912.900," are just kind of"
6917.500,6920.300," they're not only not only not that"
6921.200,6925.200," blood what the loved one there's a when the who are abandoned"
6925.800,6926.600," what not"
6927.200,6929.100," good do not live in the Kingdom"
6930.600,6931.500," but the god or"
6932.700,6934.100," something like that you"
6936.000,6937.400," in a religious context"
6939.000,6940.800," so that's how"
6941.700,6943.300," now I understand it"
6944.100,6948.200," so I think it is yes it is important especially when"
6949.200,6950.800," children for children"
6951.700,6955.500," one giving a group one child is treated"
6956.300,6957.500," I'm just kidly"
6958.100,6959.600," it harms everyone"
6960.400,6962.500," everywhere single white in that group because"
6963.800,6966.700," it seems every few they can be that"
6967.800,6968.600," victim to"
6969.900,6973.800," they can be also putting to their kind of powerless situation"
6974.400,6977.100," so I think the sense of powerless is really"
6978.300,6981.200," hopeful and it kind of just made"
6981.900,6983.300," make us believe that"
6985.900,6986.300," we are"
6987.100,6988.300," worthless"
6988.900,6989.400," which is"
6991.000,6992.700," far from the truth"
6993.000,6994.100," that right and"
6994.700,6994.800," yeah"
6995.400,6995.600," yeah"
6996.700,6998.700," I think that's right on Simone the"
6999.400,7003.500," it brings us back to the comment earlier about safety"
7004.600,7006.700," actually with the ventral bagel system"
7007.900,7008.800," I think that's a very"
7010.000,7010.200," very"
7011.500,7013.200," beautiful observation about"
7013.600,7015.000," the importance of Justice"
7016.000,7016.900," injustice"
7018.600,7018.900," yeah"
7019.500,7021.000," there's a beautiful song"
7021.800,7025.100," Peter Tosh song is where he says I don't want peace I want"
7025.400,7027.000," equal rights and justice"
7029.900,7031.100," but I'm afraid we're going to have to"
7031.900,7033.700," stop now Simon it's time"
7034.300,7035.400," and I want to"
7036.700,7041.400," I want to thank everybody for being here and thank you Sarah please over to you"
7042.200,7044.500," and I know it's been a you know quite a"
7045.300,7047.400," quite a difficult topic that I"
