2.500,3.600,"okay welcome"
4.300,4.600," welcome"
5.100,5.200," yeah"
5.900,6.200," good to"
7.700,9.300," great to see you all great to be with you"
10.000,10.900," thanks for coming I know"
11.500,13.900," a good number of you have come from a good"
14.600,16.200," distance a good lead distance"
17.300,19.800," some of you really the other side of the world Singapore"
20.700,23.000," some of you from welcome Singapore"
23.700,29.100," so some of you from many parts of the us and also I think I saw Calgary Alberta"
29.300,30.100," on the list and"
31.200,32.300," other parts of Canada"
33.600,36.800," and online we have people in the UK"
37.900,39.600," and all over the US and"
40.100,41.800," Canada and elsewhere"
42.700,43.300," and we're all"
44.300,44.600," right"
45.200,45.400," here"
46.400,48.900," wherever we are this is where we are"
49.400,49.600," here"
51.300,53.900," and we call this weekend or"
55.000,56.300," well three days together"
57.000,57.500," coming home"
58.700,58.900," and"
61.400,62.200," I answered that"
62.800,65.200," the first word out of my mouth was welcomed"
66.200,68.500," and I always think that actually"
69.500,73.600," a true welcome is a little bit of a double-edged sword"
74.700,76.300," it's it's a come on in"
77.600,81.200," and come home that's our invitation"
82.300,82.900," but actually"
87.200,88.000," the Gathering"
89.200,89.600," of Us"
90.800,91.700," in a place like this"
92.500,93.400," at a time like this"
94.600,94.900," but the"
95.400,96.400," purpose Les"
97.000,97.500," purpose"
98.300,99.300," that we have here"
100.500,101.500," is not only"
106.200,107.900," easy warm lovely"
109.200,110.300," there's not only that"
111.800,112.600," it's actually"
113.600,114.800," like any true journey"
117.000,117.900," true journey"
119.000,121.900," in other words a true process of Discovery"
122.900,124.600," and perhaps of Change"
125.800,127.200," and an uncovering"
129.200,130.300," you know it's not only"
132.000,132.500," what we want"
133.200,133.600," it to be"
134.800,137.800," you know I I think the great wisdom of Buddhism"
138.800,141.600," all the great wisdom of Buddhism begins"
142.100,144.100," with the first noble truth"
145.600,147.500," that is suffer"
148.700,149.200," suffering"
149.800,150.700," exists"
152.200,156.200," that was actually the portal I mean the great wisdom of shaky Buddha"
156.500,157.700," sudata guitarra"
158.400,159.500," the great wisdom"
161.400,162.400," and courage"
163.500,164.600," of shaky Buddha"
165.400,166.500," was that he didn't"
167.100,169.200," try to get away from suffering"
170.100,171.700," he did the exact opposite"
172.300,173.800," he borrowed into it"
174.700,178.400," he did the thing that we least want to do with suffering"
179.600,182.300," and the thing we least want to do is actually experienced it"
183.000,185.200," in a we want will distract us ourselves from it"
186.000,189.300," will will run away from it if we possibly can"
189.800,192.300," we'll smother it will suppress it will"
193.300,193.500," just"
194.100,195.600," don't let me know about it"
196.200,196.300," please"
197.100,200.400," and I'll throw that rest of my life into a voiding it"
201.100,205.400," and to doing all these things that will keep me so busy that I won't have to feel it"
206.400,214.100," and somehow it'll have enough stuff around me that even at the moment of death or the time of death I still won't really have to feel it"
214.500,217.500," and maybe I can load my mind up with belief systems that"
217.900,224.500," make it easier and even more don't have to feel it you know and the wisdom of wisdom traditions"
225.200,226.000," is the opposite"
227.000,229.400," it's you know they start I forget where I read this book"
231.000,233.700," I think in a few places the wisdom of indigenous"
234.800,236.500," people's & indigenous wisdom"
237.200,238.300," is that they never"
239.100,240.600," avoid the dark stuff"
241.400,245.200," they think mostly the the spiritual path the human path"
245.800,247.300," is precisely the opposite"
247.800,249.600," it's going into the dark stuff"
250.300,251.500," it's going into the shadow"
252.200,253.100," as young put it"
253.600,254.700," because that's what"
255.100,255.600," really"
256.300,257.300," needs to be"
258.600,260.100," tended and known"
260.800,261.100," and"
261.900,263.700," opened up to and then"
264.700,266.600," we don't have to feel so bad actually"
267.300,268.100," then we can"
268.800,270.700," be changed by what we didn't want"
271.600,273.500," and grow through what we didn't want"
274.000,274.700," and that's actually"
275.500,277.900," a pretty good description of the Buddhist path"
278.500,279.700," there is suffering"
280.600,283.800," suffering has a cause if we go in"
284.400,286.300," and understand personally"
287.000,288.500," through personal experience"
288.900,290.000," what suffering"
290.200,292.700," suffering is and what is causes are"
293.200,293.900," in US"
294.600,298.700," and of course also in the systemic work let collectivity"
299.700,300.900," if we go into it"
301.300,301.800," then"
303.200,304.300," we can actually"
305.000,306.000," I mean this is the claim"
306.500,307.000," of Buddhism"
307.500,308.200," we can actually"
309.100,309.400," bring"
310.400,310.500," the"
311.400,312.600," causes of suffering"
313.900,314.000," to"
315.100,315.900," to a close"
317.300,317.800," to assess"
319.400,322.500," to all I would think it's probably better to think of it in terms of"
323.000,325.800," we can really see the causes"
326.700,328.700," when we really see them actually"
329.700,330.800," we kind of see"
331.800,332.100," through them"
333.100,333.700," they don't"
334.300,336.600," remain so Solid"
337.700,339.800," and we didn't actually have to get rid of them"
340.600,341.600," the whole project"
342.200,343.600," of getting rid of"
344.400,346.300," the bad stuff whether through distraction"
347.100,348.700," or where the through somehow I'm going to"
349.000,350.500," shove it all out you know"
351.100,352.100," and I do all this hard"
353.100,355.200," therapeutic work or something and get rid of it"
355.400,355.800," is it"
356.900,360.000," going to shovel it all the way it'll just keep on growing"
360.600,362.100," it's a game of whackamole's"
362.600,364.400," you know it's not actually"
365.700,368.700," it's actually more a massive seeing it"
369.000,370.700," but what it really is"
372.500,375.600," and in the process of doing that I'm throwing a lot of you at once you know but"
376.000,377.400," this is I'm just going to rule for the moment"
377.800,382.700," and in the process of seeing through it for what it really is we also do that amazing thing"
383.800,386.800," the very important thing we actually see through"
387.500,388.500," the one who"
389.200,389.700," didn't want it"
391.000,395.400," we don't just see through it you can't see through it without really seeing through"
395.900,397.300," the one who sees it actually"
398.200,399.900," this is another great wisdom of Buddhism"
400.700,403.500," you know and it's said in the lineage in which I am deeply"
404.000,406.800," most deeply changed to whatever shadow extent I am"
407.200,408.000," in Samos and"
408.400,409.000," they say"
410.300,413.400," you can't really see through the self"
414.100,414.600," clearly"
415.300,417.200," unless you also see through the world"
418.200,422.500," and you can't really see through the world clearly unless you also see through"
423.300,423.700," the self"
424.600,425.700," and Buddha said"
426.800,428.500," consciousness"
429.200,430.200," and world"
430.500,432.500," I like two sheaves"
433.100,434.100," of reeds"
435.100,438.700," in a matter of Lakeside rebate and"
439.600,440.300," it's time for"
441.400,443.300," you know attached making everyone's out there"
444.600,445.900," with a sickle cutting the"
446.700,447.000," the Great"
447.500,447.800," long"
448.200,450.300," bull Rushes and Rushes and reads and"
450.800,455.100," then they're they're tied up in sheaves you know that word yeah"
456.000,456.900," you got two of them"
457.900,459.100," leaning against each other"
459.800,461.200," and this this Wisdom says"
462.000,463.300," if one Falls"
464.200,465.000," the other Force"
466.900,467.300," and that's"
469.100,469.700," liberation"
471.200,473.100," so the Buddhist liberation"
475.600,476.700," it comes in two"
477.800,478.100," packages"
479.200,480.200," one package"
480.900,481.100," is"
481.500,482.000," ending"
482.700,484.900," the human heart and the human mind"
486.200,487.300," letting the human heart"
489.300,490.600," be more and more welcomed"
491.100,495.400," letting it find its own warmth it's own warm it's own warm welcome for itself"
496.600,497.300," and the other"
498.400,500.100," liberative process is"
500.700,501.700," the seeing through"
502.800,505.100," it discovering that they're really is"
506.200,507.000," a reality"
508.200,509.600," again in zen terminology"
510.100,512.200," before Evan and earth"
513.000,514.700," before the sky and the earth"
515.200,516.800," there is a reality"
517.500,519.100," before the sky and the earth"
519.600,522.900," in indeed it has no form it has no shape"
523.400,523.900," much less"
524.600,525.000," and name"
525.700,526.700," eyes can't"
527.000,527.300," quite"
527.700,528.000," see it"
529.100,531.300," it has no voice for the ears"
531.700,532.300," to detect"
533.300,534.500," you could call it mind"
535.000,535.700," you could call it"
536.500,537.000," nature"
538.400,539.100," but that"
539.500,541.900," violate to call it sorry to call it mine"
542.700,546.200," you might call it mine you might call it Buddha or Buddha Hood"
546.800,548.100," but that violates it"
549.100,552.700," and it turns it into a visionary flower in the air it's not mine"
553.100,553.900," it's not good"
554.700,556.100," absolutely quiet"
557.800,559.300," yet illuminating"
560.600,561.900," in a mysterious way"
563.000,567.100," it allows itself to be perceived when we are clear I"
570.200,572.100," it allows itself to be perceived"
573.800,574.400," clear"
576.400,579.500," oh my good worthy friends gathered"
580.000,580.300," here"
581.200,582.900," if you want to hear"
583.600,585.000," the thunderous voice"
586.000,586.800," of the Dharma"
588.200,589.500," exhaust your words"
591.200,592.600," come to the end of words"
593.800,595.200," empty your thoughts"
596.100,596.800," let thoughts"
597.700,598.300," lie down"
600.000,600.100," like"
600.800,602.600," happy dogs at the end of a busy day"
605.000,605.500," but then"
605.900,606.700," you may"
607.400,608.500," come to recognise"
609.300,609.800," this one"
610.500,611.000," essence"
614.600,615.200," which is always"
616.600,616.900," already"
618.200,618.500," here"
620.000,621.200," always already"
622.300,622.500," here"
625.300,625.600," okay"
627.600,629.100," so if that's paragraph one"
632.400,633.400," paragraph two"
635.900,636.900," what do we actually do here"
638.500,641.100," well we are going on some kind of journey"
641.800,643.500," you know in these three days we have to go together"
644.200,647.600," and to be perfectly honest I don't know what that journey is going to be"
648.500,649.200," any more than"
650.700,651.400," you guys do"
652.300,657.400," I have to a few little Inklings or a kind of kind of no kind of hope you know"
658.100,662.900," but I really believe that any true journey should always be into what we don't know"
663.500,666.000," that's actually kind of the point of a real journey"
666.600,667.600," it's precisely"
668.400,670.100," that we're expanding the map"
671.000,673.100," you know we think we got our map of the world"
673.900,675.300," and I know where the edge is"
676.300,678.600," and I know it's far that's the end of the Land"
679.500,680.800," and I'm okay with that"
681.300,682.900," but the true journey is"
683.500,685.500," what's beyond the edge"
686.700,688.900," and I've told this story before but when I was a"
689.500,691.300," I think I must be in about five"
692.400,695.400," and you know we had our garden in our house in Oxford"
696.100,696.800," and I loved"
698.200,700.100," running around it and it had a brick"
700.500,703.500," brick wall around it and a brick wall at the end of it and I kind of"
704.300,710.000," probably not just five getting a little bit older I kind of dead myself to jump off higher and higher"
710.500,711.300," parts of the wall"
712.000,714.600," somehow amazingly I never broken ankle"
715.200,719.600," because I would leap off this very high part of it you know and in onto a kind of"
720.500,724.600," compost tea parsley because it was nice and soft even if it was smelly"
726.100,727.100," but I knew you know"
727.700,729.600," that a young age I got it"
730.300,731.200," there's the garden"
731.900,733.200," and it has the brick wall around it"
734.800,737.800," I've heard about this thing called spaced out of space"
739.200,739.400," and"
740.400,740.900," I got it"
741.600,745.100," there's this sort of area called space and Rockets go there and there's"
745.700,748.000," the moon's up there and stars when everything they are"
748.700,750.900," and space ends in another brick wall"
751.300,753.100," it's obvious it must do like our God"
754.400,755.200," I was just sure of it"
756.800,758.700," and then I suddenly had the thought"
760.200,764.800," maybe I was five or six or seven I don't know I probably I think probably younger than 7"
765.600,767.400," it suddenly occurs me one day"
769.200,771.600," okay space and that brick wall"
772.100,773.000," like our garden"
774.200,776.000," but what's the other side of the brick wall"
778.500,779.800," and it's a bit like that"
780.900,784.800," with us we we can come to know the edge of our"
786.400,788.600," capacity for experience or something like that"
790.500,790.900," and then"
793.500,794.400," could there-- be more"
795.500,797.600," is there something beyond what I know"
798.900,801.900," what is beyond what I know is there something beyond"
802.500,803.100," what I know"
803.800,805.100," and it's quite hard"
805.500,806.200," to recognise"
807.200,807.400," that"
808.700,811.100," we only know what we know you know you know what I mean"
811.700,813.400," it's it's sort of because that's what we know"
815.700,816.600," so the journey"
817.000,818.100," the journeying"
818.600,818.800," is"
821.300,821.800," softening"
822.400,822.800," basically"
823.600,824.900," softening our certainty"
825.900,826.800," are certain tears"
827.300,828.600," becoming more okay"
829.600,829.800," with"
833.100,833.800," uncertain"
835.200,836.500," then was as you know"
839.000,842.600," you're doing you're sort of you get more brownie points when you don't know"
843.600,844.500," then when you do know"
846.700,848.300," not knowing as most intimate"
849.300,851.300," it's a famous car not knowing"
852.900,853.900," it's most intimate"
854.300,856.000," not knowing is the past"
856.500,857.300," to intim"
858.300,858.900," with our life"
863.000,863.100," and"
864.600,865.300," so that's sort of"
865.900,867.700," a little bit of a sketch of the journey"
868.300,871.500," of the possibility of the journey but how do we do it well we've got"
873.100,874.300," a sort of thing we've got three"
875.500,876.600," agents or"
877.900,878.500," fuels"
882.200,890.200," the first one and I might I might have to adjust this list when my resume we've got five but the moment I'm thinking we've got three"
890.600,892.300," the first one is basically"
893.400,894.300," being quiet"
894.900,895.400," and still"
896.300,896.600," together"
897.800,898.500," and we'll do some"
899.400,900.600," guided sitting"
901.200,902.500," just to help us get into it"
903.100,905.600," and we'll do some silent sitting as well at times"
909.100,911.700," so quiet and still that's one agent"
912.800,914.000," another agent is"
914.600,916.500," sort of the Teachings you know which"
917.500,921.700," I'll be doing my best to represent with snippets and stories and poems and things"
922.600,923.300," that may help"
924.200,924.500," give us"
926.200,928.700," another frame of reference or more frames of reference"
929.400,930.400," then we then we have"
931.300,932.300," and then the third one"
933.300,937.500," the third agent in an in an experience in a journey like this is one another"
938.800,939.500," that we're all"
939.900,940.100," here"
940.700,941.500," doing this"
942.000,942.200," together"
954.700,955.000," so"
955.700,955.900," um"
957.400,959.400," I don't know how many of you have ever done a sweat Lodge"
960.500,960.600," yeah"
960.900,962.100," a few a few yeah"
962.700,964.100," yes so you kind of in it right"
964.800,967.000," if you just have to"
967.400,967.700," basically"
968.600,969.100," give in"
970.000,970.700," yeah yeah"
972.100,974.700," this is this is not as intense as a"
976.000,976.600," you won't get"
977.600,981.400," deemed pouring down over your body you know it's not as fast as that"
982.300,984.500," but there's a certain kind of gentle heat you know"
985.600,988.700," certain kind of gentle process that begins to be at work"
989.500,989.600," and"
990.700,991.000," the"
992.300,993.700," the lesson of it"
994.000,995.400," the lesson of the sweat Lodge"
996.200,997.800," in in this context is just"
998.600,1000.600," you don't really need to do anything"
1001.800,1003.200," it's going to do it to you"
1004.200,1006.900," so don't be worrying like am I doing this right"
1007.600,1013.200," oh my gosh I should be trying harder oh I missed something I got to go back and see what that was and"
1013.600,1014.800," I should do that bit better"
1015.400,1018.400," you know that little bit then I sort of missed it I want to do it again better"
1018.900,1019.500," none of that"
1020.200,1022.000," just don't need to you're just here"
1023.000,1023.800," in this sort of"
1025.000,1025.500," chamber"
1026.300,1026.700," beautiful"
1027.100,1028.900," look at this beautiful chamber right"
1029.600,1031.200," made of the Earth on which is Stan's"
1032.000,1034.600," being here since 1985 or 84 or 85"
1035.200,1037.000," there's a great big turtle under us"
1037.600,1038.400," on the ground"
1039.300,1039.500," and"
1040.900,1042.600," it was made"
1043.400,1044.500," with one purpose only"
1045.200,1045.700," this room"
1046.200,1047.900," it was made for gatherings"
1049.100,1051.300," of stillness and quiet basically"
1052.100,1052.800," where humans"
1053.600,1054.000," come"
1055.000,1056.400," to do this thing together"
1058.000,1059.100," called meditation"
1059.600,1061.500," called being still and quiet"
1062.100,1063.700," I'd say you could just call it being"
1064.800,1066.500," where we leave are doing at the door"
1067.000,1068.300," and come in and find out"
1069.300,1069.800," what is it"
1070.800,1071.800," what is this human thing"
1072.600,1074.200," body mind heart what is it"
1075.300,1079.100," that I've been sort of using without thinking about it all my life you know"
1079.400,1082.100," maybe I thought about it a bit maybe we had the Old flash of"
1082.800,1083.900," oh my gosh it's not what I thought"
1084.700,1086.100," this experience is not what I thought"
1086.700,1089.600," and then ah back into life and on it goes and I get busy"
1089.900,1090.700," busy busy busy"
1091.400,1091.700," and then"
1092.600,1095.400," at a certain point whatever it is that makes us"
1096.500,1097.000," hey"
1097.600,1098.000," Don"
1098.400,1098.600," I"
1099.600,1102.800," I want to understand I want to experience and I want to sort of"
1103.300,1104.700," know this thing"
1105.500,1106.800," called a human being"
1107.600,1108.700," before I before it"
1108.900,1110.900," it decays for it stops"
1111.500,1113.600," in this still doesn't even breathe doesn't"
1114.500,1115.300," have consciousness"
1115.800,1117.100," in the way that we know it and"
1117.700,1120.400," gradually decays and then there's just bones"
1121.600,1123.800," and 110 billion have gone that way already"
1124.500,1125.700," you know sapiens"
1126.700,1128.800," not counting or Homo erectus and"
1130.100,1132.400," whatever they're all called fabulous and you know"
1133.200,1134.700," all the way back piss and"
1136.100,1137.900," pissy can throw us is it or something"
1138.900,1142.800," that the the the Cancer pains are they called I can't remember"
1143.200,1144.400," 5 million years ago"
1147.300,1147.600," okay"
1148.100,1149.400," so we we put a little"
1150.100,1152.300," with little there is a little pause button"
1153.400,1154.300," that we have and"
1155.200,1156.900," we're all collectively- just tapping on it"
1158.900,1160.800," and slowing down so let's do a little bit of the"
1161.200,1162.300," slowing down part right now"
1175.200,1176.100," yeah you know we've"
1176.800,1178.700," like I was saying many of you who have come"
1179.700,1180.900," a significant distance"
1182.100,1185.100," and even those who haven't who just who live in Santa Fe"
1185.900,1187.300," which is a handful here"
1187.900,1190.400," only really a handful and but we"
1191.600,1192.200," we've all"
1192.700,1193.300," come from"
1193.800,1195.600," activity and and motion"
1196.800,1197.100," and now"
1199.000,1199.800," we're coming into"
1200.400,1201.000," something different"
1202.200,1202.400," so"
1203.500,1205.000," so the first order of business"
1206.200,1206.600," is just"
1207.500,1208.200," taking stock"
1209.900,1211.100," just kind of getting to know"
1213.100,1216.300," what's on board right now what's what's happening in the system"
1217.800,1219.200," the various systems"
1221.400,1222.200," so we'll have a"
1222.600,1223.900," guided sit now"
1224.300,1224.900," for a little bit"
1226.200,1227.500," I'll ring bells"
1228.300,1231.900," in a bit of a whimsical way I don't know exactly how many and when but"
1232.200,1234.900," more or less they'll be some to start and some to finish"
1235.800,1242.300," and it'll be obvious if it's finishing and during a sit here's here's some ground rules actually"
1244.600,1246.500," with the intention during a sit"
1247.400,1248.400," is to be still"
1249.600,1250.700," and comfortable"
1251.700,1253.000," so if you're uncomfortable"
1253.800,1256.100," it's good it's better to move"
1257.200,1257.700," and adjust"
1258.500,1258.700," and"
1259.200,1261.100," the movement might be you just need to"
1261.700,1263.700," I don't know adjust on the seat a little bit"
1264.600,1266.200," or it might be bigger than that"
1266.500,1267.900," or it might be that actually"
1268.500,1268.900," yeah"
1269.200,1271.300," I'm not so good on this cushion I want to chair"
1271.900,1273.400," and that's okay too"
1274.200,1277.500," you can do whatever movement you feel would be good for you"
1278.200,1279.800," the only request"
1280.800,1281.700," is that you do it"
1282.600,1283.800," just a bit slower"
1284.800,1287.700," than your natural inclination would be"
1288.300,1289.700," because if you do it a bit slower"
1290.400,1291.000," you'll do it"
1291.700,1292.600," with awareness"
1293.500,1295.600," you'll be aware of the movements you're making"
1296.000,1297.700," and if you're aware of the movie you're making"
1298.300,1299.400," you want to disturb anyone"
1301.100,1302.700," the other you'll amplified there"
1303.700,1304.200," mindfulness"
1305.000,1305.300," okay"
1306.400,1309.200," and related to that if you get"
1311.300,1312.700," if you get sort of walled"
1313.900,1315.000," buy a wave"
1315.900,1317.100," of fatigue"
1318.700,1321.100," which is not that uncommon"
1322.300,1324.100," when we come into stillness"
1325.200,1327.300," yeah it might not be this morning it might be this afternoon"
1327.900,1330.000," you might get a wave of fatigue"
1331.300,1334.100," and are sort of encouragement here"
1335.900,1336.500," is that"
1337.700,1338.500," it's actually"
1339.900,1340.200," best"
1340.800,1341.600," to have a nap"
1342.900,1345.200," and that's not so easy in a chair so he's on a cushion"
1345.500,1345.900," so you just"
1346.500,1348.100," quietly make your way out"
1348.800,1352.000," either to the back of the room or anywhere that you can lie down"
1353.100,1354.700," and put your head on something soft"
1355.900,1361.100," you just quietly go and do it and so the options are in this room is perfectly okay if you want to do that"
1362.200,1364.300," um as long as you protect your head"
1366.300,1368.700," out in the little foyer in the office"
1369.300,1372.700," you know it just you kind of just pick your spot outside with a coat on"
1373.600,1375.800," that we got extra cushions haven't we"
1377.000,1377.600," just out there"
1378.100,1378.100," but"
1379.000,1381.100," yeah there's loads of cushions out in that"
1382.100,1384.200," carpet is for your area so just grab"
1385.100,1386.800," grab what you need if that's the"
1387.800,1388.800," if that's the thing you need"
1390.100,1390.700," don't kind of"
1391.900,1392.700," white Knuckle it"
1392.800,1393.100," you know"
1395.000,1395.200," okay"
1470.800,1472.500," don't feel if you're back is"
1473.200,1473.900," being supported"
1475.100,1476.500," buy the back of a chair"
1477.600,1478.600," or couch if"
1479.000,1479.400," you're online"
1480.700,1481.300," really"
1481.900,1484.300," if you're back to that"
1484.900,1485.300," support"
1487.800,1490.800," if your back is free unsupported"
1493.100,1495.600," check that your balance so you would have"
1496.300,1497.700," ears over shoulders"
1499.000,1499.500," shoulders"
1500.500,1501.600," over hips"
1508.000,1508.700," and you might"
1510.000,1513.900," have a sense of a thread at the top of your head gently gently"
1515.700,1516.700," pulling drawing"
1518.000,1518.800," drawing you up"
1519.200,1520.500," and drawing your spine"
1522.000,1523.300," into alignment"
1531.800,1533.700," and then unless relax the jaw"
1536.500,1537.300," and the throat"
1540.100,1541.400," feel the jaw sink"
1543.400,1545.800," an eighth of an inch or 16th of an inch"
1549.400,1550.600," Feel It move away"
1551.800,1552.700," from the upper door"
1554.700,1555.700," tiny amount"
1561.400,1561.700," and"
1562.600,1564.500," let shoulders arms and hands"
1567.400,1568.200," let them go"
1571.300,1572.200," and let them hang"
1581.400,1582.500," and then we're going to let"
1583.200,1585.500," all the soft tissue of the body"
1586.400,1587.400," the musculature"
1589.200,1591.600," let it all relax like an old coat"
1597.600,1598.900," buying is upright"
1601.100,1602.300," to cure stable"
1606.400,1608.400," like a like an internal column"
1611.900,1612.800," effortlessly"
1614.000,1614.700," upright"
1615.300,1616.000," aligned"
1619.000,1620.100," then everything else"
1622.300,1624.000," can just kind of hang"
1625.000,1625.700," Slack"
1627.900,1629.000," chest belly"
1632.100,1632.400," back"
1633.400,1636.100," hanging like the back of a coat on a coat rack"
1638.800,1639.800," again the arms"
1640.800,1642.400," sort of like empty sleeves"
1648.400,1650.600," hips relaxed seat relax"
1652.800,1654.300," upper legs knees"
1656.500,1657.100," relaxed"
1658.200,1658.800," Slack"
1660.000,1661.900," lower legs ankles and feet"
1664.500,1665.500," also Slack"
1666.500,1667.500," whole body Slack"
1671.200,1672.000," yet upright"
1682.900,1685.100," so just take a little inventory what's"
1686.500,1688.900," what's On Board what have you got on board right now"
1690.200,1690.500," is that"
1692.100,1693.500," some sense of momentum"
1695.800,1696.700," recent days"
1699.900,1701.000," is there some sense of"
1702.100,1704.800," kind of wolf what am I doing here or"
1706.300,1707.300," what's this all going to be"
1708.900,1709.900," where am I exactly"
1720.700,1721.700," that's just know that"
1722.600,1726.200," whatever you're finding you know a first order of business is"
1727.200,1727.800," is to"
1728.500,1729.400," to let it be here"
1731.500,1732.200," welcome it"
1734.000,1734.600," it's okay"
1737.000,1737.700," it's normal"
1788.500,1789.500," so letting"
1790.100,1790.900," whatever there is"
1791.700,1792.400," in you that"
1795.500,1796.900," that's active"
1798.100,1799.000," that it be welcome"
1801.300,1802.000," all of it"
1803.800,1805.300," is just not a problem it's"
1806.300,1807.000," it's a"
1808.100,1809.400," whatever there is is what"
1809.900,1811.300," that needs to be right now"
1819.000,1822.100," just give it a word of acknowledgement inwardly"
1827.500,1831.200," and then let's start just seeing what we can taste of"
1832.500,1832.800," of this"
1833.400,1835.400," ancient Hall wherein"
1839.300,1840.000," made of"
1840.400,1840.900," birth"
1841.900,1843.000," as old as the planet"
1852.500,1853.500," what are we hearing"
1864.200,1866.500," kind of dial into the soundscape"
1879.300,1882.100," can you hear the subtle strata"
1884.300,1885.900," like strata in Rock"
1887.900,1889.300," of background sound"
1951.600,1952.600," keep listening"
2010.200,2010.900," a.m."
2011.000,2012.600," I try bringing in a label"
2013.900,2015.000," a little word here"
2016.200,2018.100," h e a r here"
2030.800,2033.300," every so often in the mind silently"
2034.000,2036.200," try saying that word to yourself"
2038.000,2038.400," here"
2042.900,2046.300," as a light encouragement to keep"
2048.600,2049.700," staying away"
2051.400,2052.300," of hearing"
2055.100,2055.900," here"
2063.200,2063.400," here here"
2148.300,2151.600," I invite you to sort of feel into"
2152.700,2153.600," your surroundings"
2155.500,2159.100," kind of sense the space of this room we're in"
2161.000,2163.100," other quiet people in it"
2165.300,2166.200," of the trees"
2167.800,2168.400," wind"
2170.100,2170.900," clouds"
2172.300,2173.300," around the building"
2211.700,2213.200," is there a way that they"
2214.200,2217.200," the surroundings can kind of help you rest"
2222.800,2223.600," the wind"
2224.900,2225.600," re"
2227.100,2228.900," the space in the hall"
2233.800,2236.500," could they somehow be invitations"
2237.800,2238.400," to rest"
2241.500,2242.500," power down"
2251.900,2252.500," come home"
2284.900,2285.700," home has a"
2286.500,2287.100," place where"
2289.100,2289.700," you're okay"
2291.400,2292.300," and actually you don't"
2293.400,2294.700," you don't need to do anything"
2302.900,2304.500," yes he had a free of"
2306.900,2307.600," tasks"
2309.400,2310.400," for a little while"
2314.600,2315.400," you can come back"
2317.100,2317.300," being"
2317.900,2318.400," just being"
2319.100,2319.400," you"
2350.300,2350.800," just"
2352.600,2352.900," being"
2424.900,2428.000,"I'm so another another ground rule actually is that"
2428.500,2429.200," any time"
2431.300,2434.100," we're in a sit and you feel like you're sort of"
2434.700,2435.200," cruising"
2436.300,2438.900," floating flowing and having a really good time with a sit"
2439.300,2441.300," and you don't quite wanna come out of it"
2442.500,2450.200," when you know there's a sort of semi-official ending of it apparently you can just just cruise on don't don't feel you"
2450.800,2451.900," it's a change of thing"
2452.800,2455.700," because actually I my hope is that over time"
2459.000,2463.900," we we sort of erode the distinction that we put up a sort of date"
2464.800,2467.300," like one side of the day I meditating"
2468.300,2469.700," and the other side of the nut I'm not"
2470.000,2470.400," I'm living"
2471.100,2475.000," so they're sort of living over here then there's a dike and then as meditating a little bit of"
2475.500,2476.200," small dike"
2476.500,2479.300," just enclosing a little bit of time is de that's meditation"
2479.900,2481.400," and then all the rest is non meditation"
2481.700,2482.000," I actually"
2482.900,2484.700," I think the journey of meditation"
2485.400,2487.600," is extremely complex with many layers"
2488.400,2490.000," and it's also extremely simple but"
2491.900,2493.700," I don't want to over simplify it"
2494.300,2494.600," and yet"
2495.300,2498.000," when I actually can't oversimplify it's so simple but"
2498.700,2499.600," that aside"
2500.000,2501.900," it is a process over time"
2502.500,2504.800," no longer having such a distinction"
2505.300,2506.500," between when I meditating"
2506.900,2508.600," and when I'm not meditating"
2509.200,2510.300," because I C meditation"
2510.600,2512.300," is not about meditation"
2513.600,2515.500," practice as we sometimes call it"
2515.800,2517.500," is not really about"
2518.300,2518.800," practice"
2519.600,2522.000," this is the really possibly the most important point"
2522.500,2523.500," it's about you"
2524.700,2525.600," It's About Us"
2526.500,2526.900," actually"
2527.500,2531.900," practice isn't about anything it's about you being you"
2532.500,2535.400," and the journey that it invites and it does have a journey"
2536.000,2539.200," is that we don't know all there is to know about who we are"
2540.600,2542.500," and and I suppose we never will"
2543.300,2545.800," and we can definitely make discoveries"
2547.000,2549.400," when not just what we think we are"
2550.200,2552.100," we're not our life isn't just"
2552.800,2554.400," what I've thought it was"
2555.000,2556.000," and we can have"
2556.700,2560.800," subtle gentle gradual hints of that"
2561.700,2563.300," we can also have sudden"
2564.000,2564.700," surprising"
2565.100,2566.900," revelations of that"
2567.500,2569.100," where we suddenly see"
2570.100,2571.200," oh my gosh"
2571.800,2573.600," I've never been separate from anything"
2574.200,2575.600," it doesn't make any sense"
2576.000,2577.700," it doesn't make any sense to"
2578.000,2580.600," the way I've constructed and understood the world"
2580.800,2583.000," but it's undeniably true"
2583.400,2586.100," I've just discovered this other level"
2586.600,2588.300," of my very own being"
2589.000,2589.400," where"
2589.900,2591.300," I'm not separate from anything"
2592.000,2592.800," that's a real"
2593.600,2593.700," thing"
2595.000,2596.000," except it's not a thing"
2596.700,2599.600," but it's real and anybody who's"
2600.200,2601.900," had the best hint of that"
2602.400,2603.200," knows"
2603.500,2604.400," it was real"
2605.800,2607.200," and actually it's"
2607.800,2608.500," there is"
2609.600,2609.800," I'm not"
2611.100,2614.200," sufficiently versed in the science of it but there is science"
2614.800,2618.100," these days this beginning to get around to supporting that view"
2619.300,2621.800," probably mostly in the area of neuroscience"
2622.300,2627.300," but some Wild Ones claim also in kind of quantum physics and stuff where"
2627.900,2630.600," the things are separate the way they're supposed to be you know"
2632.600,2632.700," but"
2633.300,2636.200," but not only does it need to be those kinds of"
2637.600,2638.100," you know the"
2639.000,2640.200," traditional sort of big"
2640.600,2644.700," revelations of oneness of Unity of emptiness and"
2644.900,2646.400," there's also just subtle"
2647.100,2647.400," chips"
2648.500,2651.000," where where we go from and this is actually the"
2651.800,2653.300," what what my original love"
2653.900,2656.700," book and sort of program is all about is like"
2657.400,2657.800," yes"
2658.300,2659.400," there are"
2660.400,2663.000," sort of major revelation moments that can happen"
2663.700,2666.100," and of course we know various traditions"
2666.900,2668.000," offer pathways to them"
2668.900,2669.700," but there's also"
2670.700,2670.900," just"
2671.900,2672.200," little"
2672.900,2673.500," tiny"
2674.100,2674.700," shifts"
2675.500,2677.300," that are very beautiful"
2678.600,2679.200," when I go"
2680.700,2684.300," let's say a morning I get up I'm worried about one of my son's"
2685.200,2691.000," as all kinds of reasons to worry about them believe me you know and any parent knows what I'm talking about"
2691.400,2695.900," you know and and I'm sitting there and I'm just oh wow okay"
2696.900,2700.000," oh yeah yeah I I realise I've been caught in the imagining some"
2701.300,2702.200," scenario you know"
2702.700,2703.800," and it's painful and"
2704.500,2704.800," and then"
2706.400,2710.800," so there's a moment of of recognising that and a feeling some kind of weight"
2711.600,2713.000," in my chest my heart"
2713.800,2716.600," and I'm still kind of kind of in it"
2717.300,2719.800," and then there's a little tiny shift"
2721.000,2724.900," which I wish I knew how to package this and make it available to everybody"
2725.400,2727.000," because it's the critical one where"
2728.100,2728.600," somehow"
2729.700,2729.900," I"
2731.200,2734.400," I stop thinking that that's a problem"
2736.000,2736.800," and I realised"
2737.300,2740.200," it's my human nature it's my human heart"
2740.700,2741.900," it's what's happening"
2742.500,2743.400," and I go from"
2744.000,2746.800," thinking oh gosh I don't want to be feeling this way"
2747.600,2747.800," to"
2750.200,2751.100," I'm a human being"
2752.400,2753.900," and it's not a big thing"
2754.700,2756.300," but it's a huge thing because"
2757.900,2760.000," suddenly I'm not caught in it"
2760.600,2763.400," you know that difference between being caught in it"
2764.700,2764.900," and"
2766.600,2767.000," teeing it"
2768.700,2768.900," right"
2769.500,2770.900," I think that's the heart of"
2771.800,2773.700," sometimes I think that's the most important thing"
2774.600,2778.400," I'm sorry you'll hear me saying look this is the most important thing this is the heart of it"
2780.800,2784.800," because actually it's always the most important thing the most important thing is always now"
2785.100,2788.500," so whatever is actually now is always the most important thing"
2789.000,2789.800," in a certain way"
2791.500,2794.700," and we're always riding the very edge of now"
2795.500,2797.800," we're surfing the crest of now"
2798.600,2800.000," always the most important place"
2800.900,2801.700," because it's the only place"
2807.100,2807.300," okay"
2810.100,2813.100," so here's a way to think about that that little shift"
2816.300,2818.600," I've been kind of just reflecting on this recently actually"
2820.300,2821.000," you know how"
2823.500,2825.600," okay a movie"
2826.900,2828.000," has to make us"
2829.700,2829.900," stop"
2830.300,2831.600," knowing that it's actors"
2832.300,2832.400," alright"
2833.100,2834.800," and Aristotle the great Greek"
2835.200,2835.800," philosopher"
2836.200,2840.100," he was very interested in many things including art and drama and stuff"
2840.700,2844.600," and he said there's a thing called he called it suspension of disbelief"
2845.400,2846.400," you got to stop"
2847.100,2849.400," disbelieving the drama in other words"
2850.500,2855.000," in Athens when they were acting on the stage here in the amphitheatre"
2855.900,2860.100," they had to forget it wasn't Joe and Nancy from next door"
2860.500,2864.700," you know it was actually Oedipus and jocasta or whatever had to think it was"
2865.100,2867.300," yeah to stop knowing it was humans"
2867.900,2871.200," and actually believed that it was these mythological figures right"
2872.300,2874.100," that's suspending disbelief"
2875.600,2876.400," and I think"
2877.200,2877.700," this is just"
2878.000,2880.700," put it out I'm putting it out there see if it works for you"
2881.300,2883.200," but I think that's analogous"
2883.600,2885.600," to how our thinking operates"
2886.600,2886.700," the"
2887.300,2889.000," actually when we're thinking"
2890.300,2891.300," we are hearing"
2891.700,2892.200," talk"
2892.500,2893.100," in the mind"
2894.300,2896.800," and we're seeing images in the mind"
2897.300,2899.200," one or other or very often both"
2899.800,2901.600," we get little movie reruns"
2902.000,2906.200," and movie trailers what might be coming right trailers and reruns right"
2908.200,2910.200," and sometimes edits"
2910.500,2911.900," edits of reruns right"
2914.000,2920.100," there's this great old poet friend of mine Sam Willis a fantastic poet that a very troubled difficult life"
2920.500,2921.700," you can find his one book"
2923.300,2924.400," new light for the old"
2924.800,2925.200," dog"
2925.700,2926.200," beautiful"
2926.800,2929.700," book but he says if he ever writes A Memoir it will be called"
2930.100,2931.700," my plans for the past"
2937.600,2937.700," so"
2939.400,2940.500," that process"
2941.200,2941.800," the movies"
2943.200,2945.300," of the past the future whatever"
2945.800,2946.400," the imaginings"
2947.300,2948.300," in our minds"
2949.200,2950.300," they want us"
2951.000,2952.200," to suspend disbelief"
2953.200,2953.500," in other words"
2954.100,2957.200," they want us I don't know why but they want us to stop"
2957.900,2960.100," thinking that just images in the mind"
2960.500,2963.600," just talk in the mind they want us to get sucked in"
2965.100,2966.500," and they're really good at it"
2967.600,2968.100," and so"
2970.700,2971.800," how do they do that"
2972.900,2973.000," well"
2973.600,2976.500," again I think probably like drama"
2977.100,2977.800," and movies"
2978.700,2979.600," on the big screen"
2980.100,2980.900," dramas on stage"
2981.500,2982.400," stories in novels"
2983.000,2985.900," they do it by engaging our emotion"
2986.800,2987.700," emotionality"
2988.300,2989.000," or hearts"
2989.700,2996.700," they like getting this feeling Center going because once it's going and you got the talk and you got the images you're in"
2997.200,2997.900," you know"
2999.000,2999.500," and then"
3000.500,3002.300," and then and then what"
3002.700,3003.200," well then"
3003.600,3006.000," you can ride the train of thought or good long time"
3007.200,3009.600," you know okay so be it you know"
3010.200,3011.200," it's not it's ok"
3011.900,3012.300," you know it's"
3013.600,3015.000," that's part of our makeup"
3015.800,3016.300," it's okay"
3017.400,3021.500," and actually as meditators as people with some level of practice"
3024.300,3025.500," you know we're we're kind of"
3026.700,3027.800," you know to some extent"
3028.600,3029.200," we want to get"
3029.600,3032.600," kind of a bit better at catching that right you know because"
3033.300,3035.300," we've maybe recognised over"
3035.600,3038.100," beginning to recognise and we're curious about"
3039.100,3040.600," am I really present"
3041.500,3045.100," and would it be different if I was really present"
3045.600,3048.400," and how present can I actually be"
3049.400,3051.100," not just in duration of"
3052.300,3056.900," periods of time but are there different levels degrees of presence"
3057.400,3058.100," of awareness"
3058.700,3059.800," you know when I am present"
3060.300,3061.800," I I might be present"
3062.400,3063.100," to this level"
3064.200,3065.100," but maybe I could be"
3065.800,3067.200," when I am present present"
3067.700,3068.700," to this level"
3069.400,3070.400," or this level"
3071.600,3072.600," I remember was a kid"
3073.400,3074.700," realising one day"
3075.200,3077.300," walking to school with my satchel a books"
3078.100,3079.700," kicking a pebble along the gutter"
3080.500,3081.100," I realised"
3081.500,3082.800," one day I realised"
3083.700,3085.700," I came to a lamp post along the street"
3086.200,3086.900," and I realised"
3087.500,3088.500," I had no idea"
3089.200,3091.100," how I got from the previous lamp post"
3091.800,3092.800," to that post"
3093.500,3094.900," and it suddenly struck me"
3096.200,3097.100," am I awake"
3098.600,3100.400," what what is it mean to be a way"
3101.800,3106.100," could I be I think sometimes I'm awake in a sense that I know I'm here"
3107.300,3110.600," and some of that apparently I'm not awake I don't even know that I'm walking"
3112.200,3113.600," and when I am awake"
3114.400,3115.600," how do I know if I'm"
3116.700,3117.100," fully"
3117.500,3117.900," awake"
3119.600,3122.000," is there a way I could be more awake"
3122.500,3123.700," than I am when I think"
3124.300,3124.800," I'm awake"
3128.800,3131.200," so as meditators practitioners"
3132.000,3136.600," we might be curious about that we probably are a little bit curious-- at least about"
3137.400,3138.100," the difference between"
3138.700,3139.600," when I'm just lost"
3140.100,3140.900," I'm present"
3141.400,3144.200," I mean I know my body and mind are sitting in a certain room"
3144.700,3146.000," but man I'm not there"
3146.400,3150.200," I'm off in Ancient Greece or wherever you know remembering something"
3150.800,3154.500," too decades ago or imagining something three weeks from now or whatever"
3162.500,3163.500," so I have some"
3165.200,3165.900," curiosity"
3166.700,3167.300," about being"
3168.100,3168.300," more"
3168.800,3169.100," present"
3170.900,3173.300," and some curiosity may be about"
3173.700,3174.600," the processes that"
3176.000,3176.800," hate me out of that"
3178.400,3179.300," or the limit"
3183.200,3183.300," and"
3184.100,3187.800," is there something going on in me that actually doesn't want"
3188.500,3188.600," to be"
3189.800,3190.400," more present"
3193.800,3194.200," how much"
3195.800,3196.600," am I ready"
3197.100,3197.100," to"
3197.800,3198.500," at times"
3199.200,3200.800," release my hold"
3201.800,3203.500," on the things that occupy me"
3204.500,3205.200," we're not saying"
3205.600,3208.200," don't have projects and things you want to do and"
3208.700,3209.800," hopes and dreams and"
3210.200,3210.600," don't have"
3211.200,3216.400," relationships and don't have friendships and don't do all the things that you do that's lovely have a"
3216.900,3220.200," big rich Life That You Want to Have whatever you want it to be my"
3220.500,3221.900," someone are really simple life"
3222.400,3224.600," someone a busy life with lots of different things someone"
3226.100,3228.200," simple and busy life you know someone"
3228.700,3231.300," have complex and busy life it's all good you know"
3232.000,3234.300," but why not also"
3235.300,3235.900," sometimes"
3236.300,3238.000," hit the pause the pause button"
3238.900,3239.800," and notice"
3240.400,3243.400," that all along you're having the great gift"
3244.500,3245.400," of Life itself"
3246.300,3246.900," which is not"
3249.600,3250.100," forever"
3251.200,3251.400," you know"
3253.000,3253.400," or"
3253.700,3257.100," maybe in some strange way it kind of is but we'll"
3257.900,3259.200," put that on the shelf for now"
3259.600,3263.400," because we don't really know what this is"
3264.700,3268.900," that's one of the nice things about this journey of Discovery don't know where we're going to end up"
3269.400,3272.900," the more we go on the journey the more we start"
3273.600,3274.900," throwing things over the side"
3275.200,3278.600," of the boat we thought we knew this it's not working anymore chuck it over"
3279.100,3279.900," you know"
3280.300,3282.400," more and more things drop Away to"
3284.100,3285.100," what are you know anyway"
3286.200,3287.400," don't want to scare you you know"
3290.900,3291.000," yeah"
3291.600,3293.100," so actually I think right now"
3294.200,3295.100," we need a little"
3297.700,3298.100," a little a little"
3299.400,3299.900," change of pace"
3300.800,3302.500," and I want to invite you to"
3303.400,3303.600," just"
3304.500,3305.600," greet"
3306.400,3307.000," and neighbour"
3307.700,3310.000," and or more than one but get into"
3310.900,3312.200," finding a way to a pair"
3313.200,3315.900," and maybe it's better if it's actually not someone"
3316.900,3320.100," you know you know if you if you're open to"
3321.600,3322.700," meeting someone new just"
3323.100,3326.100," do that in preference and if you don't really don't want to that's fine"
3327.100,3330.700," perhaps if you came together you can stick together also"
3332.400,3338.800," and let's just have a little prompt that you'll each talk to"
3339.600,3340.400," a question"
3341.200,3343.400," just for a couple minutes and then switch"
3344.300,3346.500," and talked the other way is is just"
3347.400,3348.500," what is home mean"
3349.000,3349.300," to me"
3350.200,3350.500," okay"
3351.300,3352.900," and I'll ring a bell"
3354.500,3358.100," halfway so you can trade and the one who's listening"
3359.800,3362.200," this is a little bit of an exercise and a practice actually"
3362.900,3366.700," one of you gets to talk first and don't feel pressured you can"
3367.500,3368.300," you know you you might"
3368.800,3369.300," you might find"
3369.900,3372.200," it's a little sticky at first you're not sure what to say it's fine"
3372.900,3373.700," so just take your time"
3374.500,3374.700," and"
3375.700,3378.000," and the other one see if you can just listen"
3379.000,3380.200," and not encourage"
3381.000,3381.800," just listen openly"
3383.100,3385.700," and nothing yeah yeah you know nodding and you know"
3386.200,3387.400," see if you can just listen"
3388.800,3389.400," and then you switch"
3390.600,3391.900," I'll bring the Bell and you can switch"
3392.800,3394.600," and then I'll ring the bell again and have a little"
3396.400,3397.100," conversation"
3398.100,3398.500," and then"
3399.300,3403.300," we'll reconvene and all of that is kind of five or six minutes it's not a long thing"
3404.100,3405.900," okay so have at it"

3889.300,3892.100," really we we also had a similar theme"
3893.800,3899.000," and it started with me sharing my story of when I first came to"
3899.700,3900.900," like New Mexico and"
3901.600,3908.000," was flying over the Albuquerque airport in like 1996 and seeing the sandia mountains"
3908.400,3909.700," I just started crying"
3911.300,3914.800," out of some vulnerable place that I had no concept what was happening"
3915.600,3917.900," and then when I finally had a"
3918.300,3919.600," rent a car and was driving"
3920.200,3923.300," the first thing I saw was this huge sign that said welcome home"
3924.200,3929.400," and so for me this area of New Mexico is the home for my soul"
3930.100,3932.900," and what Glenn was saying is that he grew up as a"
3933.300,3934.800," in the military family"
3935.300,3938.000," and that they went everywhere and when he hid Albuquerque"
3938.500,3939.700," and Elizabeth too his wife"
3940.300,3941.300," they said I'm home"
3942.000,3945.300," we're here so something about that merging and"
3946.100,3947.700," the wind and the in the rocks and"
3948.300,3951.400," everything here in this New Mexico area just"
3951.700,3953.500," fills us up and nourishes us and it's"
3953.900,3955.200," comforting and secure"
3955.500,3957.000," I'm still very emotional and"
3957.600,3958.400," satisfy"
3958.900,3961.100," thank you thank you that's that's that's beautiful"

3974.300,3977.200," okay see from New Hampshire and I were talking"
3978.600,3979.900," Casey mentioned his"
3981.700,3985.000," spirit looking for a spiritual home and look at"
3986.700,3991.500," going through Judaism and evangelical Christianity and all"
3994.000,3997.800," I have been a hospice doctor my whole life and"
3998.700,4000.000," professional life and"
4001.400,4004.400," have tried to help a lot of people find that"
4004.700,4006.600," place of comfort and now"
4007.400,4010.500," I have cancer in all my bones and I'm looking for"
4011.300,4015.400," the the burner sort of turned up under the search for"
4017.200,4017.500," home"
4021.300,4022.100," well welcome"
4023.100,4023.600," and I"
4024.700,4028.300," I want to dare to say you come to the right place"
4029.000,4030.200," I think there are many right places"
4030.900,4031.200," and this is"
4031.600,4032.900," I I believe one of them"
4034.100,4035.100," because you're sitting here"
4035.600,4036.100," with"
4036.300,4038.000," with others who are also sitting"
4038.400,4038.600," here"
4039.500,4040.700," Wellcome Porter Eric"
4040.900,4041.100," yeah"
4042.200,4042.500," great"
4043.000,4043.300," yes"
4050.000,4051.100," my name is Gail"
4051.600,4054.000," I've been married to Porter for 37 years"
4054.500,4056.600," this is our anniversary celebration"
4057.200,4057.600," uh"
4058.200,4058.200," oh"
4063.100,4066.400," my home after a very checkered past"
4067.400,4069.700," was to became Porter"
4070.800,4071.800," and Porter is"
4072.100,4075.700," about to leave the planet we don't know if it's tomorrow we don't know if it's years"
4076.600,4080.700," and so the security and the stability of my life because a very complex"
4081.200,4082.500," childhood has been"
4083.200,4086.500," with Porter and so the burner has been turned up under"
4088.100,4090.300," me too and so it's but it's"
4090.800,4092.700," quite wonderful to be here"
4093.200,4096.900," just in the year and a half since his diagnosis we have discovered you"
4097.500,4099.200," we meditate every morning in the evening"
4099.800,4100.500," to you to the way"
4101.300,4101.900," I just"
4102.800,4103.100," thank you"
4106.400,4107.400," thank you for being here"
4110.000,4110.500," ah"
4110.600,4111.800," you know occasionally"
4112.500,4113.400," it happens that"
4114.600,4116.300," somebody in a gathering"
4116.900,4117.900," is on the brink"
4119.200,4120.700," and I always think"
4122.800,4122.900," it's"
4123.500,4124.300," it's beautiful"
4125.300,4125.600," that"
4127.700,4128.900," people are open about it"
4129.200,4130.500," when that's the case"
4131.200,4134.600," and I think it's a it's the ultimate teaching"
4135.100,4136.600," it's the ultimate blessing"
4137.300,4138.500," as the ultimate wisdom"
4139.300,4143.600," because we're all always on the brink and we just don't think we are"
4144.400,4146.000," but not one of us knows"
4147.800,4148.600," what tomorrow brings"
4149.500,4149.600," you know"
4150.700,4155.200," and anybody again I think of parents are particularly prone to this"
4155.600,4156.300," what the phone"
4157.000,4157.500," can bring"
4158.800,4159.600," one phone call"
4160.100,4161.300," can change your life you know"
4162.200,4166.400," and it may be it may be you but it may not be you it may be somebody"
4167.100,4168.700," who's extremely precious to you"
4169.700,4171.700," and we're all we're all going the same way"
4172.900,4173.800," and thank you"
4174.800,4177.500," for for sharing your wisdom with us"
4178.000,4178.500," yeah"
4179.500,4180.100," thank you"
4180.300,4181.500," it's wonderful you're here"
4184.100,4185.900," I mean I think it's kind of pointing"
4186.800,4188.000," already to"
4188.500,4190.800," a point that I thought I might make tomorrow"
4194.800,4195.800," and it's sort of like"
4196.600,4196.900," you know"
4197.700,4200.400," I think we can love places and we can love"
4201.000,4201.500," of course"
4202.400,4204.600," relationships that nourish us so much and"
4205.200,4209.200," and and Holmes buildings we can love them as great no problem"
4209.600,4211.400," but in the end we somehow"
4212.600,4215.200," you know isn't our only home really"
4215.900,4217.100," the one place"
4217.700,4219.600," we really have which is here"
4220.700,4221.700," and if it's not here"
4223.300,4224.100," and it's over there"
4226.000,4227.700," do we have a really even get to it"
4228.400,4229.800," can we get over there"
4230.500,4231.900," it's still actually here"
4233.600,4234.200," and I think the"
4234.500,4235.100," power of"
4236.500,4242.700," this kind of training you know and I thought of think it is a training meditation practice you know"
4243.700,4246.300," it's a journey it is it kind of journey"
4246.900,4249.100," but it's it's it's a weird journey"
4250.100,4252.200," because although in some ways it's kind of"
4252.600,4253.800," developmental"
4254.400,4257.500," and if I look at my own path of meditation when I Began"
4258.200,4260.000," age 24 or 25"
4261.600,4264.100," to today you know over 35 years later"
4264.500,4265.300," and I think well"
4266.200,4266.500," yeah"
4267.500,4271.600," a lot there's been a lot of sort of travel with different kinds in the course"
4272.100,4273.200," of those decades"
4275.800,4277.000," but also their hasn't"
4278.200,4280.000," because it's always about"
4281.600,4282.000," here"
4285.800,4285.900," and"
4287.500,4288.000," maybe"
4288.500,4289.200," it's it's"
4291.000,4291.600," it's it's it's it's it's"
4292.300,4295.400," if it is a journey it's a journey of just"
4296.500,4296.900," somehow"
4297.800,4298.300," letting"
4299.400,4299.600," hear"
4301.300,4301.700," in"
4304.500,4304.700," more"
4306.900,4308.900," you know and to me that implies"
4309.800,4310.700," some kind of"
4311.900,4313.800," softening of a boundary"
4315.500,4316.600," between me"
4317.800,4318.400," and here"
4319.800,4322.800," that there's some kind of imaginary membrane"
4324.400,4328.400,"I don't drill down into this metaphor too much because I'm not sure about it"
4329.400,4331.600," but there's some kind of a sense of"
4332.300,4333.100," I'm here"
4334.000,4334.500," I'm"
4335.000,4335.500," in"
4336.200,4338.200," this membrane whatever it is and"
4339.300,4340.700," here is outside"
4342.300,4343.500," and somehow"
4344.600,4345.500," that membrane"
4346.500,4347.200," can soften"
4348.300,4349.400," become more porous"
4351.700,4352.200," maybe"
4353.700,4354.100," joe"
4354.500,4356.000," that it was wasn't really here"
4357.300,4359.000," that it wasn't really here in the first place"
4361.400,4363.300," and I'm not really separate for me here"
4365.100,4367.400," and that that is a kind of journey"
4368.900,4369.500," sort of"
4370.300,4372.300," that I know I'm trying to think of a good analogy it's like"
4372.700,4375.700," there's a great analogy they have in Tibetan Buddhism where"
4376.500,4379.200," our consciousness our personal consciousness"
4380.100,4381.300," is like a little cup"
4381.900,4382.800," of consciousness"
4383.500,4385.300," a consciousness in a little cup"
4386.500,4387.400," made of clay"
4388.500,4389.200," and actually"
4390.000,4390.600," there's a great"
4391.500,4392.700," ocean of consciousness"
4393.900,4395.100," outside our little cup"
4396.300,4397.300," and the journey"
4398.000,4400.400," or the process of the meditative journey"
4401.200,4402.300," is that that cup"
4404.900,4405.300," turned"
4405.600,4406.600," to glass"
4407.900,4410.000," to turn from clay to see through glass"
4411.000,4412.200," and then the glass"
4413.200,4413.600," start to"
4414.800,4415.200," melt"
4415.600,4416.200," dissolve"
4417.600,4419.300," and so we realise there's no difference"
4419.900,4421.100," that what was inside"
4421.600,4422.600," the little shell"
4422.900,4424.600," the egg shell of my cranium"
4427.000,4428.700," and everything outside it"
4429.300,4429.700," actually"
4430.500,4432.400," I know it's so counterintuitive"
4433.200,4434.900," but actually they're not separate"
4435.900,4436.000," you know"
4436.500,4438.200," that's that's sort of the big journey"
4439.100,4440.300," of life I think really"
4441.200,4443.700," is discover when not separate"
4444.900,4446.100," which just not separate"
4446.900,4452.200," and what I've tried to do in my original love book and programming and on the app the way is to sort of"
4453.600,4454.600," is to make it so"
4456.000,4457.400," you can we can all"
4457.800,4462.700," get little glimpses and glimmers and shivers and shimmers of that truth"
4463.500,4464.500," without having"
4465.600,4467.900," to go through decades of grueling"
4468.500,4470.900," spiritual training in a monastery"
4471.600,4475.200," because actually I think it is possible without that"
4475.900,4477.400," because it's already true"
4478.600,4480.400," you know it's not really"
4481.200,4481.800," a journey"
4482.400,4484.000," somewhere else it's just a"
4484.500,4486.200," little bit of unwrapping"
4487.100,4487.200," you know"
4489.800,4494.900," a little bit of unwrapping okay"
4495.500,4499.700," so Luke is a Maestro of breath work"
4500.600,4502.800," of different kinds of movement practices"
4503.600,4504.700," also as a deep"
4505.000,4506.500," meditator actually in these"
4507.100,4507.900," I'm honoured of"
4508.200,4510.100," say he's been a student and mine for"
4511.200,4512.100," a decade or sir"
4512.900,4513.100," and"
4514.200,4516.300," and he is going to come in and lead us"
4516.900,4517.900," in a few minutes of"
4518.700,4519.000," body"
4520.000,4520.400," gentle"
4520.800,4521.500," nice easy"
4522.100,4522.800," body stuff"
4524.400,4525.100," oh good morning"
4526.300,4528.600," nice to see you all here from the other room to here"
4529.100,4533.600," this may seem credit to you but in January we had 79 people in here"
4534.400,4537.100," so this isn't so bad so I would invite you to stand up please"
4538.600,4542.600," and just be mindful of your space those of you on cushions and perhaps step off"
4544.700,4549.400,"uh and um just maybe even just noticed your neighborhood you've already spoken to and"
4550.400,4551.100," we're not going to do anything"
4552.100,4553.300," excessive binding means"
4553.800,4556.000," but please take a look down at your feet"
4557.000,4560.500," let your feet be a little bit wider than your hips perhaps you have a"
4561.200,4561.800," broad base"
4562.500,4564.200," then your knees half an inch"
4565.000,4566.500," and then close your eyes just for a moment"
4567.000,4569.200," let your arms hang by your size just like ropes"
4570.200,4571.800," and feel pleased"
4572.500,4573.800," feel the weight of your body"
4574.600,4577.000," spreading into the ground into this floor"
4577.900,4580.300," very much into this ground and"
4580.800,4582.200," earth and space below us"
4583.700,4585.300," and then feel your bones"
4585.700,4586.500," feel your skeleton"
4588.200,4592.100," feel all of your muscles essentially drooping off of your bones"
4593.100,4596.400," and giving way down into your feet which are like spreading into the ground"
4597.300,4599.400," and notice if you will your natural"
4599.900,4600.600," silent breath"
4601.800,4602.400," in the floor"
4605.300,4607.300," and really not just the floor but"
4607.800,4609.900," the groundedness of your entire body here"
4612.800,4617.000," and feel the highest part of your body so your head and the crown of your head"
4619.500,4622.100,"and then just give your knees a little bit of a bend"
4623.500,4623.600," just"
4623.900,4625.900," kind of you can go side to side like a"
4626.800,4630.200," if you were a cat needing a pillow you may even pick a foot up off the ground"
4630.900,4633.200," you can open your eyes not my make it a little bit easier"
4635.100,4637.200," just kind of you could look down and just kind of press"
4638.100,4641.400," into the ground and see what that does to your body and let your body be really relaxed"
4642.200,4646.700," and essentially what I'm going to open US into is called the qigong bounce"
4647.200,4649.700," QI is energy gong is practice"
4651.500,4655.000," way to decipher with those words mean and then find the center between both feet"
4655.600,4658.300," just begin to move your knees just bounce your knees good"
4658.900,4661.100," and you'll feel how this begins to come out through your body"
4661.900,4664.300," and you can go at any pace or speed will change"
4665.200,4667.300," gears both change the pace here together"
4668.000,4670.800," in time but notice that your body will in this movement"
4671.400,4673.500," begin to want a little bit more breathe"
4675.900,4678.300," so let that Stagger and yeah you can access out through your mouth"
4682.300,4685.100," just notice if you will the any areas of tension"
4685.600,4687.700," just let him soften so that the whole body is"
4688.800,4689.800," basically just"
4690.100,4691.400," receiving this bounce"
4693.500,4695.000," and really receiving your breath"
4696.200,4700.500," and if there's tension that shows itself like say in your feet of your legs from"
4701.200,4702.900," over efforting just kind of Shake it Out"
4704.000,4706.300," and you could even kind of do a little flick with your hands"
4707.200,4709.800," and a little bit of circling from your wrist to your fingers"
4710.900,4712.400," a little bit of a lifting of your shoulders"
4714.100,4715.300," and even now for"
4716.000,4716.600," the state"
4717.700,4718.100," 100"
4718.700,4719.900," lifts lift your heels up"
4722.600,4724.400," feel this stud that comes all the way up to your eyes"
4725.600,4727.100," and find a steady breath pattern"
4730.800,4732.100," really breathing up and down"
4741.200,4742.400," and if you don't feel"
4742.900,4744.600," like lifting you heels and you want to just keep your"
4745.500,4746.600," feet flat on the ground great"
4748.700,4751.100," so soft face relaxed mouth relaxed eyes"
4753.600,4758.800," and really following the breath through the body breathing through the whole body breathing with the whole body"
4762.100,4766.400," and so you see it sort of naturally begins to pick up some inertia and some pace"
4769.500,4773.100," just notice what your default is if you're breathing with your nose or your mouth"
4774.900,4779.800," see how it feels to do a little switch up and you know I see a lot of smiles in the room and that's what this is supposed to do"
4782.600,4783.600," so again so switch"
4784.300,4785.200," try a breathe through your mouth"
4786.900,4788.400," and then breathe out of your nose and see how that feels"
4790.100,4791.600," and because the other way breathing through your nose"
4793.200,4796.000," and out of your mouth doesn't have to be big or force"
4796.400,4798.600," just kind of a play with breath and curiosity"
4799.500,4803.800," so we'll do just a hundred more bounces and you'll notice like that's that's already 10"
4806.000,4806.200," 20"
4808.100,4810.300," so maybe bring a little bit more rigor into it 30"
4812.900,4813.200," 40"
4816.100,4818.500," and now the breathing of probably get naturally"
4819.500,4821.700," a little further so you might breathe out of your mouth"
4829.100,4831.100," right take one more big breath in together"
4834.100,4835.200," good and a big breath out"
4835.700,4840.500," and then stop bouncing and close your eyes again feel your feet again and breathe silently through your feet"
4849.800,4851.700," and again notice that spreading out into gravity"
4853.000,4853.800," and the change"
4854.200,4855.600," without sound in the breath"
4855.800,4858.000," and the way the body feels this little bit of vibrancy"
4859.100,4860.300," and the eyes can open back up"
4866.100,4866.300," exactly yeah"
4867.200,4868.400," okay thank you Luke lovely"
4869.800,4871.700," yeah"
4876.700,4879.000," I think we'll go we'll go straight into another set"
4880.000,4880.000," so"
4883.900,4884.700," get get"
4885.600,4885.800," comfortable"
4906.100,4906.700," feel the"
4907.100,4908.700," the seat supporting you"
4910.000,4913.000," and let's see if we can do this thing of blurring the"
4913.600,4916.000," the edges blurring the distinction between"
4917.000,4921.700," meditating and between non meditating and then meditating in other words"
4922.000,4923.700," go in gently there's not some"
4924.300,4927.700," hard line I'm going to ring the bell but don't think of that as a sort of"
4928.600,4930.500," wall you are now gone"
4931.600,4936.400," from the nice rough rugged posture and how we're suddenly in"
4936.500,4937.300," a primed garden"
4938.100,4941.000," where we mustn't put a foot wrong we're in a parlour now"
4941.800,4945.700," where you could break the China if you breathe wrong you know not at all"
4946.100,4946.800," not at all"
4947.400,4950.100," we're going to a nice loose friendly place"
4999.900,5003.900,"and my recent book I wrote about sitting on a beach"
5005.000,5006.600," with some kids in Venezuela"
5008.100,5009.800," and how relaxed"
5010.300,5010.800," it was"
5015.000,5016.800," there was an he's in the air"
5019.500,5020.600," whatever huddle"
5020.900,5022.200," of us it might be"
5023.500,5025.700," sitting there by The Quiet Bay"
5026.500,5027.700," under the palms"
5028.500,5030.200," as the light dissolved"
5031.200,5032.500," we were there only"
5033.600,5034.500," to rest"
5036.000,5036.900," to Hoon"
5039.400,5041.500," we made no demands on ourselves"
5043.000,5043.700," we were just"
5045.000,5045.300," being"
5047.100,5049.100," as day gave way to night"
5050.000,5050.600," so we"
5051.500,5052.300," gave way"
5053.300,5054.300," to being"
5057.200,5058.400," we slipped loose"
5059.900,5061.200," from whatever agenda"
5062.100,5062.900," we might have had"
5063.800,5064.300," and"
5065.100,5065.800," let the evening"
5066.700,5067.500," old us"
5077.100,5079.200," so come and sit with us on that beach"
5080.700,5081.500," guess settled"
5082.600,5083.600," close your eyes"
5084.800,5085.200," relax"
5086.400,5087.900," don't try to hard"
5089.600,5090.100," right now"
5091.200,5092.200," there's a great Ocean"
5093.600,5094.600," gently lapping"
5095.600,5096.300," at The Shore"
5097.000,5097.800," of our lives"
5099.400,5100.300," waiting for us"
5101.500,5102.300," to notice it"
5127.600,5129.500," some of you might have eyes open"
5130.200,5131.500," with the gays lowered"
5133.300,5133.900," some of you will"
5134.200,5135.400," have eyes closed"
5140.300,5141.600," either way rest"
5144.100,5146.500," rest with what you're seeing"
5224.700,5225.700," resting"
5226.600,5227.800," and noticing any"
5229.000,5231.900," any places in the field tight"
5241.800,5242.300," and letting"
5243.700,5246.100," a kind of restful warmth"
5247.100,5248.100," hold them"
5251.100,5255.900," so if there is any tension or tightness perhaps in the chest area"
5257.000,5258.300," which is very Common"
5258.700,5259.100," for us"
5259.500,5260.100," these days"
5262.100,5263.600," no that is welcome"
5265.700,5268.100," this is a Path of peace"
5269.600,5271.800," what a path of banishing anything"
5278.900,5280.900," if there is something like that"
5282.800,5283.800," Let It Be"
5285.200,5286.900," shown a warm welcome"
5289.500,5291.400," Let It Be the teacher right now"
5295.600,5296.200," that we honour"
5299.100,5300.000," and a grateful to"
5356.700,5359.600," or sometimes in practice we"
5360.600,5363.900," we're more kind of committed to a method"
5365.200,5366.900," we pick up a technique"
5369.300,5371.700," and we we ride it we go with it"
5373.400,5373.600," and"
5375.000,5377.900," of course for millennia that has often been simply"
5378.600,5380.100," of being aware of breath"
5382.400,5384.300," The Rise and Fall of the breadth"
5385.200,5385.900," in the body"
5396.400,5398.500," really it is rather like an ocean"
5400.000,5401.100," with waves that"
5403.700,5404.300," the travel"
5405.500,5407.500," vast distances across it"
5409.800,5412.200," and then kind of appear in US"
5414.700,5415.400," passing through"
5417.600,5418.800," rising and falling"
5423.700,5425.900," don't have to do anything special just"
5427.100,5428.500," let them do their thing"
5439.600,5440.000," yes"
5440.300,5441.700," the other times we're less"
5444.500,5446.100," focused on any particular"
5447.700,5448.300," method"
5448.800,5450.300," we we just sit"
5459.200,5459.900," we're just"
5461.500,5462.000," present"
5463.700,5464.700," the best we can be"
5468.800,5469.400," we just"
5469.900,5470.400," are"
5487.700,5491.400," so just feel into what you're more drawn to right now"
5493.200,5496.200," if it feels good to follow the breath"
5498.500,5499.100," do that"
5500.200,5501.100," stay with it"
5502.600,5503.500," and know that you'll"
5504.500,5508.200," you'll disappear into those dramas and thoughts and so on"
5509.100,5509.900," at times and"
5511.500,5513.100," that's part of the whole thing"
5514.700,5515.700," and when you come back"
5517.000,5518.100," and your present again"
5519.600,5520.300," that's wonderful"
5524.500,5526.800," great that you know you've been off somewhere"
5527.700,5528.700," great that you're back"
5531.300,5534.400," and touch the breathe as if with your little finger"
5538.900,5539.400," lightly"
5547.500,5550.800," and if you're more drawn right now to just being"
5552.300,5553.000," simply"
5554.700,5555.200," being"
5558.800,5559.000," and"
5560.900,5562.100," give yourself to that"
5781.100,5781.400," if"
5782.000,5782.900," you find you've been"
5783.800,5785.300," caught up in thinking"
5786.700,5788.500," can just check was it"
5789.400,5789.800," planning"
5790.500,5790.800," was it"
5792.600,5793.200," remembering"
5794.900,5796.200," was it imagining"
5797.600,5799.000," usually one of the above"
5799.300,5799.500," and"
5800.700,5801.200," finally"
5801.600,5803.000," in one of those three folders"
5804.000,5804.400," planning"
5805.700,5806.200," remembering"
5807.600,5808.200," imagining"
5810.400,5810.600," and"
5812.000,5812.500," be happy"
5814.000,5814.100," that"
5815.300,5817.900," your mind is doing what is doing and now"
5818.500,5819.400," you're here again"
5823.500,5824.200," just like this"
5832.800,5833.800," and if there's any"
5834.800,5837.100," little knot or nab"
5839.600,5840.600," of tightness"
5841.100,5842.100," of tension"
5842.300,5843.300," of unease"
5845.200,5847.700," perhaps in the chest or diaphragm area"
5852.500,5853.400," we welcome it"
5857.500,5858.500," we allow it"
5863.800,5867.000," there's a way we have a kind of warm awareness"
5868.500,5869.100," that can"
5870.300,5871.100," that can hold it"
5872.000,5873.000," there can be with it"
5906.900,5908.900," a lot of this practice is opening"
5910.300,5912.000," opening to what arises"
5913.900,5916.400," being open becoming more open"
5918.100,5919.300," including to"
5920.800,5922.100," inner processes"
5970.300,5971.500," gently gently"
5977.600,5978.500," being with"
5982.800,5983.800," being with"
5985.100,5986.300," experience"
5988.000,5990.200," both outward and inward"
6012.400,6015.500," just letting things be as they are"
6158.700,6160.700," see how gently"
6162.500,6164.700," how much you can Blur"
6166.100,6167.200," with distinction between"
6168.600,6170.500," meditating and not meditating"
6172.500,6173.100," just listen"
6266.900,6268.500,"yeah wow that's some"
6270.500,6273.200," very very nice first morning we're already"
6274.100,6276.400," getting that still and quiet together"
6277.000,6277.600," thank you very much"
6279.200,6279.600," really"
6279.900,6280.500," really something"
6283.600,6286.100," just a little poem find your"
6286.900,6288.100," spiritual home"
6288.700,6289.200," they say"
6290.100,6291.000," but ours"
6291.900,6293.300," was an ordinary Valley"
6294.000,6296.000," yet barely notice from the road"
6297.400,6299.300," down past a cops"
6300.300,6301.400," then a plowed field"
6302.700,6303.900," then the humpback Bridge"
6305.000,6306.800," that popped you over the canal"
6307.800,6309.800," then two wide Meadows"
6310.400,6312.200," and unmemorable Village"
6313.100,6314.100," and up the other side"
6315.900,6316.400," these days"
6317.200,6318.100," there's the most away"
6319.000,6320.200," so it won't be what it was"
6321.300,6322.000," I haven't been"
6322.900,6323.600," in eggs"
6325.900,6326.800," but the bins"
6327.300,6327.800," among"
6328.200,6329.000," the nettles"
6329.300,6330.400," behind the broken"
6331.600,6332.500," Gate where the rubbish went"
6334.200,6336.200," and the tumbled down outhouse"
6336.900,6338.700," with sometimes pee in"
6339.200,6339.900," for a lark"
6341.300,6342.700," and the grassy patch"
6343.200,6343.900," under the El"
6345.100,6347.200," shimmering bodies alive"
6347.700,6348.400," in the quiver"
6348.900,6349.600," of the wind"
6352.000,6355.400," and the shattered driveway of former owner of thought"
6355.900,6356.500," to pave"
6357.800,6358.500," and the roof"
6359.100,6359.800," shining"
6360.200,6360.900," in rain"
6361.900,6364.400," and the trees dark and quiet"
6365.300,6367.700," by the time as clouds"
6368.100,6371.600," past over and that cracked window pane"
6372.100,6372.900," by the back door"
6373.400,6374.800," where the boots stood"
6376.000,6377.200," not a stone"
6377.900,6379.000," not a brick"
6379.300,6380.000," of the place"
6381.100,6383.100," that didn't take upon itself"
6383.700,6384.800," to live on"
6386.000,6386.900," and that does"
6387.400,6387.700," live"
6388.200,6388.500," on"
6389.000,6389.900," even now"
6390.800,6391.700," long after"
6392.300,6392.700," we've got"
6402.500,6403.200," I grew up"
6403.500,6404.700," partly in Oxford"
6404.900,6407.000," partly in a Valley North of Oxford"
6407.200,6408.700," where my mum bought"
6409.700,6410.700," a ruined old school"
6411.300,6416.900," that we very slowly did up it was a little tiny bit of school that was just a little cottage with a"
6417.500,6417.900," school room"
6419.500,6421.000," slowly did it up over the years"
6422.000,6426.300," and it but it opened a world to me because I could wonder the countryside"
6427.100,6428.900," and I had that most blessed thing"
6429.900,6431.500," a puberty"
6432.800,6433.400," in the hills"
6435.400,6436.400," it's a special thing"
6437.200,6439.500," I don't know why but it is and the ancient"
6441.400,6442.800," philosophers knew that"
6443.900,6446.600," just forgotten his name parallel plutarch"
6446.800,6447.000," said"
6450.100,6450.900," youths"

6452.500,6452.800," nature"
6455.700,6457.600," 11 to 15 or something"
6458.600,6459.100," they need it"
6459.500,6460.500," to grow up straight"
6461.700,6465.800," and I made all the other things that I grew up in that made me not very straight I mean"
6468.700,6472.300," like a tree I actually did get that"
6473.000,6474.100," and it's served me"
6474.600,6476.300," throughout my entire life to date"
6476.700,6480.300," the fact that I've known what it was to be connected to a landscape"
6481.000,6483.600," I've known the human heart can bond"
6484.100,6485.400," with the land and I'm very"
6486.200,6487.800," I don't know how lucky I"
6488.500,6489.800," how luckily I got that"
6490.500,6493.200," middle other things that weren't so easy but"
6493.500,6496.100," I got that find your spiritual home they say"
6496.600,6498.900," but hours was an ordinary Valley"
6499.600,6501.600," you barely notice from the road"

6514.400,6517.700," these days there's the motorway so it won't be what it was"
6518.700,6520.600," I haven't been in ages"
6521.500,6521.700," but"
6522.300,6525.500," the bins among the nettles behind the Broken Gate"
6525.700,6526.600," where the rubbish went"
6527.200,6528.900," and the tumbled down out house"
6529.500,6531.500," with sometimes p in for a lark"
6532.200,6534.200," and the grassy patch under the Elms"
6534.700,6536.700," their shimmering bodies alive"
6537.000,6538.600," with the Quiver of the wind"
6539.100,6543.000," and the shattered driveway a former owner has thought to pave"
6543.400,6545.300," and the roof shining in rain"
6545.600,6549.400," and the trees quiet and dark biding their time"
6549.900,6551.200," as Clouds Pass over"
6552.500,6554.700," and that cracked window paint"
6555.000,6555.900," by the back door"
6556.400,6557.600," where the boots stood"
6558.500,6561.400," not a stone not a brick of the place"
6562.100,6564.000," that didn't take upon itself"
6564.600,6565.700," to live on"
6566.800,6568.700," and that does live on"
6569.500,6570.200," even now"
6571.000,6571.800," long after"
6572.500,6573.000," we've gone"

6749.800,6750.800," of the Valley behind me"
6751.400,6752.400," and the other"

6955.600,6957.500," we've already had a very rich"
6957.900,6958.700," time I feel"
6959.600,6960.500," I feel I feel I've learned"
6960.900,6961.500," plenty already"
6964.400,6965.200," what is home"
6965.600,6966.400," is it a place"
6967.800,6968.900," when we're not so sure about that"
6971.600,6971.800," what"
6973.900,6974.400," what is"
6976.400,6976.800," what is it"
6977.300,6977.600," to be"
6978.400,6978.700," here"
6980.400,6983.100," maybe we were becoming a little less certain that we know"
6987.800,6988.600," who are we"
6989.800,6991.900," maybe we're becoming a little less sure"
6992.600,6993.200," that we know"
6994.500,6995.000," is this and I"
6995.700,6996.100," am I on"
6997.300,6998.500," yeah I mean there's this one"
6998.900,6999.000," yeah"
6999.400,7002.700," it's on I'm obviously not on but"
7003.700,7004.900," if this is on we're okay"
7007.400,7011.400," I actually I wanted to just share another poem because it sort of while I was"
7012.000,7014.100," having a little rest it came back to me that"
7014.800,7016.900," you know I was talking about the value of"
7018.900,7019.700," of having"
7020.900,7023.100," some exposure to nature"
7023.900,7027.700," when I was saying how valuable it is in early adolescence of"
7028.100,7030.100," and but I mean of course it's always valuable"
7030.900,7032.700," and there's a you know a lot of"
7033.900,7037.300," work going on at the moment in the field of nature deficit"
7038.000,7040.100," nature deficit syndrome is such a thing"
7041.000,7042.300," alas"
7043.000,7045.500," and I remember actually when I was"
7047.000,7049.000," in my late 20s"
7050.500,7055.100," coming back to my childhood home the place that that poem was about in the UN"
7055.900,7057.200," unremarkable Valley"
7058.300,7059.500," not the uncanny valley"
7060.900,7062.500," the unremarkable valley you know"
7063.400,7067.400," the ordinary vali coming back to it in my late Twenties and I've had"
7068.000,7068.700," an exciting"
7070.000,7074.900," few years I I'd published my first book and been sent off to write another one and"
7075.500,7080.400," and you know as making my living already as a full-time writer which was just mind-blowing to me it's a"
7080.700,7083.400," childhood dream fulfilled it was very exciting I've been"
7084.100,7084.700," I've been in"
7085.700,7088.800," the Caribbean for a year playing my trombone I used to be a musician"
7089.500,7092.900," and I played in lots of different bands around the Caribbean and"
7093.400,7095.500," it was a it was a fantastic experience"
7096.100,7097.600," then I came back and then"
7098.400,7101.300," actually I lived in New York in a sublet and wrote"
7102.200,7106.000," finished writing that book about the Caribbean that got published and then another book was"
7106.600,7107.600," commissioned or you know"
7108.600,7110.000," an advanced was given to me"
7110.700,7111.400," bye bye"
7111.900,7117.300," a big publisher and and I came out in New Mexico for the first time to write about DH Lawrence"
7118.100,7119.600," in New Mexico the British writer"
7120.100,7120.600," you know who"
7121.300,7122.200," came from Nottingham"
7123.200,7124.500," and unremarkable City"
7125.600,7127.900," well remarkable for Rileys bikes"
7128.300,7131.100," I do have Raleigh bikes over here I think you probably do yeah"
7131.700,7133.400," a notable maker bicycle"
7134.100,7134.300," and"
7137.600,7139.500," actually he grew up 6 miles from Nottingham"
7139.900,7142.300," in an unremarkable village called Eastwood"
7143.200,7147.500," which he wrote about I think is one of his best books is sons and Lovers his"
7148.400,7151.900," his I think it's his third novel but his first one"
7152.700,7155.200," to receive some real notice"
7156.200,7158.800," and it's a lot of it is a kind of him to"
7160.000,7162.200," the hills and fields and ordinary"
7162.800,7164.000," landscapes"
7164.500,7165.300," that he grew up in"
7166.200,7169.600," anyway I came out here to write about him because this"
7170.700,7170.900," this"
7171.500,7172.900," area Northern New Mexico"
7173.800,7177.500," with the only place that DH Lawrence ever owned a home"
7178.700,7182.000," remarkably and he said when he first came here"
7182.500,7184.500," something stood up in my soul"
7185.800,7187.900," and it was the only place"
7188.700,7191.600," this is what he said that ever changed me from the outside"
7194.200,7194.600," I"
7195.100,7197.300," actually questioned that myself because"
7198.700,7203.500," I think a lot of his best writing is precisely about places that change them from the outside"
7204.200,7209.000," you know anyway that's what he declared and he said the proud morning of New Mexico"
7209.900,7211.400," bore in on his soul and"
7212.500,7214.200," and something changed forever"
7214.700,7215.300," that's what he said"
7216.400,7217.800," he didn't stay here that long"
7218.400,7222.800," it turned out when I came out here I discovered he'd only spent a total of 18 months"
7223.600,7223.800," here"
7224.500,7226.600," and the only reason he owned a house here"
7227.100,7228.900," which was indeed the only house he ever owned"
7229.200,7230.600," was because it was given to him"
7232.200,7234.500," of course"
7235.000,7240.800," I didn't know some of you may know this stuff but there was a famous patron of the Arts here in New Mexico and the early"
7241.500,7244.900," especially in the 1920s and 30s Mabel dodge luhan"
7245.800,7247.300," her fourth husband was a"
7247.800,7250.600," an Elder or at the house pueblo"
7251.600,7252.700," Tony luhan"
7253.300,7253.400," and"
7255.100,7257.200," and they had this remarkable house"
7257.800,7259.200," which is well worth of visit"
7259.700,7263.300," in Towers that were known as the Mabel dodge house now"
7263.900,7264.700," it's a great set of"
7265.500,7268.000," mud Castle you know instead of Adobe"
7268.800,7274.500," the kind of thing you'd have want to build as a kid on the beach you know mould Is sculpted Massive"
7275.000,7277.700," of shaped mud it's absolutely well Adobe"
7278.200,7280.900," a beautiful beautiful extraordinary building with a"
7281.100,7282.500," various patios and"
7283.600,7284.300," add-ons and"
7284.900,7291.200," little casitas around it and stuff you can go and stay there actually I think I have done a series still can"
7291.900,7292.100," and"
7293.400,7293.900," my"
7295.000,7298.500," Close Friend Natalie Goldberg who's a writing"
7299.200,7303.200," teacher then sort of Zen writing teacher and it got me into zen actually"
7303.900,7306.500," um she used to lead workshops there"
7307.000,7309.700," and you'd stay in the how well you say actually"
7310.700,7313.600," how did it work there was a big house they built next door"
7313.700,7314.500," to the original"
7314.900,7317.200," where you could there's a lot of accommodation in anyway"
7317.700,7318.700," it's a great place to visit"
7319.700,7320.400," but Lauren's"
7324.800,7325.800," he had known"
7326.700,7326.900," that"
7328.400,7329.900," connection with the land"
7330.500,7331.100," as a boy"
7331.700,7332.300," and a youth"
7333.100,7334.200," and he found it"
7335.400,7337.900," he was I think as he travelled a lot"
7338.500,7339.800," he died at the age of 44"
7340.300,7341.500," having gone around the world"
7342.100,7343.800," and travel you know for probably"
7344.600,7348.200," since from about 19 from basically the end of the First World War"
7349.400,7351.800," 1918 until he died in 1930"
7352.600,7352.900," he was"
7353.400,7356.300," hot footing it around the world with his wife freda"
7357.000,7357.200," they went"
7358.500,7361.600," a lot of Europe different places the Tyrol"
7362.600,7364.600," southern New York Sicily Sardinia"
7365.700,7366.200," over to"
7367.900,7369.600," Ceylon or Sri Lanka"
7370.000,7371.100," that was then called"
7372.000,7372.700," Australia"
7374.600,7375.200," time Francisco"
7377.400,7378.400," New York"
7378.800,7379.700," New Mexico"
7380.400,7381.300," New York"
7382.400,7384.100," France I can't remember it all"
7384.500,7385.800," Mexico was in the"
7386.300,7389.500," lots of travels lots of books about lots of places"
7390.300,7392.500," and he ended up in southern France"
7392.900,7393.200," dying"
7393.800,7395.900," and died there in 1930 to bercula"
7396.600,7398.800," and in fact a lot of the places he visited"
7399.300,7400.700," we're precisely the places"
7401.200,7402.800," that if you had to borculo"
7403.600,7405.000," if you were a consumptive"
7405.500,7406.200," you'd want to go"
7406.800,7407.200," hi"
7407.700,7408.300," dry"
7410.100,7412.400," not you know in the lowland cities but"
7412.900,7414.600," the Highland villages kind of thing"
7415.200,7418.900," I like the Tyrol is up in the mountains of Switzerland in Italy"
7419.600,7420.100," Austria"
7421.000,7423.200," and then there's New Mexico up here so high"
7423.600,7425.100," and New Mexico welcome to"
7425.600,7426.100," people with"
7428.400,7428.900," consumption"
7429.400,7431.700," tuberculosis which some States didn't"
7432.300,7433.500," but it was had come on in"
7434.000,7434.500," you know and"
7435.700,7439.900," and Australia the desert you know and so on and then the South of France dry"
7440.400,7442.500," quite high in the hills where he was living"
7445.400,7446.500," but all along he"
7447.100,7447.900," had this"
7448.800,7451.100," valency if I could call it that"
7451.400,7452.200," to connect"
7452.800,7453.000," with"
7453.500,7456.800," the earth beneath beneath his feet and the landscapes he was in and"
7457.000,7459.100," you can see it in the best of his writing"
7459.500,7460.500," and his poems that his"
7461.300,7462.200," his wanting"
7463.000,7464.600," to connect his vibing"
7465.000,7465.800," where he is"
7466.300,7468.500," and I've got this little theory that"
7469.100,7469.500," I'd like"
7469.900,7472.900," you to you know if you're curious see if you agree"
7473.500,7475.200," that you can get to know a place"
7476.800,7477.800," quite well"
7478.700,7479.900," by not looking around"
7480.700,7482.100," and just being still"
7483.900,7484.700," you know there's a"
7485.400,7489.000," it's kind of a almost a standing joke those of us in"
7489.500,7491.300," who have done time in the Zen world"
7491.900,7493.900," they you know so wherever you where have you been"
7494.200,7495.300," I've been to Japan"
7496.000,7499.100," I've been to Southern Germany I've been to New Mexico"
7499.600,7501.700," but what did you what what did you see when you were there"
7502.100,7503.100," well basically about"
7503.800,7510.600," three square feet of wall because you know it's the traditional thing is energy look at the wall when you meditating"
7511.700,7513.200," because they say have your eyes open"
7514.000,7515.000," just like your ears"
7515.600,7516.600," no need to close them"
7517.400,7520.800," but reduce the Field of vision so it's not so distracting"
7521.300,7524.200," and of course you can have eyes closed it's not really a big deal"
7525.000,7527.500," it's just another way of reducing the Field of vision"
7528.000,7528.700," but actually"
7529.600,7534.900," if you get in the Habit of sitting when you travel around if you know wherever life takes you"
7535.500,7536.800," because a lot of people say well"
7537.500,7539.900," I've done three weeks of sitting every day"
7540.300,7541.200," and then we went on holiday"
7542.600,7546.700," and then they said and now ten days later I'm back and I kind of want to start again"
7547.000,7548.000," but I was saying liked"
7548.700,7549.600," well why did you stop"
7550.300,7552.100," you know actually you can do it on holiday"
7552.600,7555.900," and because you don't have to have a special cushion on a special mat"
7556.300,7557.300," is this sit in a chair"
7557.800,7559.800," you just sit on a couch you said on the side of the bed"
7560.200,7560.900," you sit on the floor"
7561.600,7565.600," you know it really doesn't matter if you if you really like being on the floor"
7566.400,7568.300," pile of some pillows or something you know"
7569.100,7572.200," and I say I used to travel with little inflatable cushion"
7572.900,7573.600," that was"
7574.200,7575.400," a neat little thing you know"
7576.000,7578.600," Wade nothing packed down yeah you got one yeah"
7578.900,7579.200," exactly"
7579.900,7581.600," it's got the beach ball inside has it"
7583.100,7584.700," and you blown in a blown up here"
7585.100,7586.700," in the hole yeah yeah great"
7587.300,7587.700," very good"
7588.800,7592.200," you can get it just the right height you know"
7592.800,7595.200," see what our later the beach ball Will spring a leak"
7595.400,7597.900," and but you know you can replace it"
7598.600,7598.900," anyway"
7600.700,7601.700," when you"
7602.600,7604.900," get the Habit of sitting regularly"
7605.500,7606.000," you'll find"
7606.800,7607.300," actually"
7607.900,7608.200," yeah"
7608.700,7610.100," I went to kamakura"
7610.700,7613.000," and I didn't walk around the town very much"
7613.800,7614.500," but I know it"
7615.500,7616.500," on some other level"
7617.100,7618.600," I feel I know that place"
7619.600,7621.400," just cause I was sitting still"
7622.200,7624.300," and my something in me"
7625.000,7626.500," knows how to see"
7627.500,7627.800," without"
7628.800,7629.200," eyes"
7630.300,7631.700," you know they say that in Zen"
7632.100,7633.600," and they it knows how to hear"
7634.500,7634.800," without"
7635.700,7636.300," ears"
7637.500,7640.100," it feels it's census"
7640.900,7641.700," and yeah there's some"
7642.800,7644.600," sensory and put your sitting there"
7645.400,7648.700," in the dark old semi lit xender with his louvered"
7649.100,7649.600," shutters"
7650.000,7652.700," didn't have windows for a long time just these shutters"
7653.300,7654.900," hot and summer cold and winter"
7655.800,7656.400," and you hear"
7659.300,7660.000," the neighbourhood"
7660.700,7661.900," people washing dishes"
7662.700,7664.500," calling to each other laughing"
7665.300,7665.700," shouting"
7666.300,7666.900," in a and"
7667.500,7668.300," and somebody"
7669.300,7670.100," opens a door"
7670.600,7671.300," clumps outside"
7672.100,7673.900," does something outside some chore"
7674.200,7675.200," comps back inside"
7675.800,7676.500," door closes"
7677.100,7677.700," you get to sort of"
7678.100,7678.300," feel"
7679.500,7679.800," people"
7680.500,7682.400," doing their thing and you feel"
7683.300,7684.000," the neighbourhood"
7684.700,7686.200," doing it's thing"
7687.000,7688.100," and that's actually"
7688.700,7689.700," a huge part"
7690.500,7695.400," that's the most important thing so good know it's a it's a large"
7695.800,7695.900," piece"
7697.700,7699.900," of what this practice is about"
7700.400,7701.500," is about learning"
7702.300,7702.800," to let"
7703.300,7704.200," the world Dio"
7704.700,7705.300," this thing"
7709.600,7710.500," the wind does"
7711.100,7711.700," the wind"
7712.800,7714.200," the rain does the rain"
7715.200,7716.100," clouds do"
7717.300,7718.400," their cloud thing"
7719.800,7721.900," plants do that plant thing trees"
7722.500,7723.400," do their 3 things"
7724.600,7725.800," and if only"
7726.500,7727.400," we could do that more"
7727.900,7729.200," and be content with that"
7729.700,7732.500," and realise what a gift it is to be able to appreciate that"
7732.900,7735.000," maybe we wouldn't be so caught up"
7735.300,7735.800," in China"
7740.800,7741.800," things so much"
7742.300,7745.000," and change things so much and be so hungry"
7745.400,7746.800," that we've got to extract"
7747.700,7751.900," collectively- as a culture extract extract give me more give me more"
7752.300,7753.200," Is Never Enough"
7753.900,7756.000," however much we have you can have the whole"
7756.500,7757.600," British Empire"
7758.100,7763.100," you know one third of the world's surface or whatever it was insane and it's not enough"
7764.600,7768.600," it's not enough and how do you get all that with a lot of soldiers"
7770.000,7771.500," with a lot of soldiers"
7772.100,7773.600," and a lot of munitions"
7774.000,7775.400," and a lot of Killing"
7775.700,7779.600," that's how you get it how do you keep it same way a lot of Killing"
7780.600,7781.100," to get"
7781.600,7781.900," get"
7782.300,7783.700," get well get everything"
7784.500,7784.600," will"
7785.200,7788.300," manufacturer out of it and sell it back to you"
7789.100,7789.800," and will basically"
7790.400,7791.300," pillage your country"
7791.900,7794.100," because we need it because it's not enough"
7794.900,7795.900," we don't have enough"
7796.500,7798.100," that insatiable hunger"
7798.500,7799.800," it's in US you know"
7800.300,7802.200," we might say that was then"
7802.800,7803.600," they did wrong"
7804.100,7807.400," they did wrong as if they're not human like we"
7808.000,7811.400," are and the fact is is human is human wiring"
7811.900,7814.000," and that's why these practices matter"
7814.400,7815.400," is because we are"
7816.200,7816.600," actually"
7817.600,7817.800," at the"
7818.400,7819.400," front line I mean"
7819.700,7822.200," there's lots of different kinds of front lines one of them"
7822.600,7823.900," is actually facing"
7824.600,7826.600," are even loosening wiring"
7827.100,7827.800," that is"
7828.800,7831.000," that we are marvelous we are"
7831.400,7833.400," brilliantly collaborative and Co-operative"
7833.800,7836.200," and Incredibly creative and in genius and"
7836.600,7837.900," it's incredible what"
7838.300,7840.400," that our species has has accomplished"
7840.900,7841.600," it is"
7842.100,7843.100," and at the same time"
7843.700,7844.600," we're awful"
7845.200,7845.700," we've got"
7846.600,7846.900," a"
7847.800,7851.300," twitch the flips like that into total aggression"
7851.700,7852.800," dehumanization"
7853.400,7854.200," and violence"
7855.000,7857.200," and great destruction it's not just violence"
7857.800,7860.400," so much of the runners as we know is against"
7861.300,7862.200," other human beings"
7863.000,7866.200," but there's violence against the earth there's violence against the climate"
7866.700,7870.300," there's violence against the oceans there's violence against the ocean beds"
7871.000,7872.800," there's now there's going to be violence against"
7874.200,7874.600," planets"
7874.900,7875.200," you know"
7876.100,7877.900," non-terrestrial things"
7878.600,7878.700," and"
7879.700,7879.900," actually"
7881.600,7883.100," the wise old traditions"
7883.600,7884.700," they understand it"
7886.000,7887.500," that they don't hide from it"
7888.000,7892.000," and then I'd say we we must pretend we're better we can be better let's"
7892.600,7896.300," let's have the lord of light and worship the Lord of light in a"
7896.700,7897.400," that this in"
7897.700,7899.900," I mean fine maybe there is a lot of light I don't know"
7900.500,7902.700," but there's also the Darkness Within us"
7903.700,7905.500," and we're going to also"
7905.900,7906.300," end"
7906.600,7908.100," to the Darkness Within us"
7908.900,7909.400," and we're going to"
7910.000,7911.800," it's not something to be ashamed of"
7912.400,7914.900," you know it came down to us we inherited it"
7915.200,7916.600," and we are the front line"
7917.100,7918.200," you know and it's it's kind of"
7919.200,7922.900," you know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it can be very upsetting but"
7923.400,7923.700," somehow"
7926.400,7928.100," we don't want to turn away from it"
7929.000,7929.600," that's not"
7930.200,7931.100," the wise thing to do"
7931.700,7932.400," the wise thing is"
7933.000,7933.100," say"
7933.800,7934.400," well gosh"
7935.500,7936.000," I"
7936.600,7937.300," I Own It"
7938.300,7939.700," you know really I Own It"
7940.200,7941.300," and actually yeah"
7942.000,7944.100," there are things that I can do about it"
7945.000,7948.400," and one of them is the great thing that we're doing of not doing anything"
7949.100,7951.300," of being still stopping doing"
7952.300,7953.600," because let me stop doing"
7955.400,7958.000," you know everybody likes to say I've said it many times myself"
7958.600,7960.200," don't do B right"
7961.100,7966.700," they're just good the meditation teachers love that you know I'm doing the radical act of not doing anything you know"
7967.200,7972.200," and I mean it sort of true I think you can see John cabins in there's a lovely clip of him in front of"
7972.900,7974.700," probably many many lovely clips of him"
7975.000,7980.400," you know John cabins in who started the mindfulness-based stress reduction a heart doctor in Massachusetts Who"
7980.900,7982.700," have done a lot of meditating in the Zen"
7983.300,7985.600," style in the terabyte of a passenger style as well"
7986.400,7987.000," and decided"
7988.900,7991.600," gosh the Medical Profession needs this"
7992.400,7994.100," but I can't call it meditation"
7995.100,7995.400," because that's"
7996.100,7997.500," weird fringe"
7997.900,7998.500," woo woo"
7999.000,8006.200," I'll call it mindfulness based stress reduction so as much more scientific you know but it was still meditation actually"
8006.800,8009.900," but there's a there's a short to him where he's in front of a lot of people and"
8010.400,8011.100," explaining it all it says"
8012.100,8015.500," I'm gonna do the really radical thing now"
8016.200,8018.500," as he's getting ready to sit down on his cushion"
8019.100,8021.500," I've just not doing anything"
8022.300,8022.400," you know"
8023.100,8025.800," and and I mean it's alright but I feel that"
8026.400,8027.200," I mean I agree but"
8027.700,8029.200," when a human service right or wrong but"
8029.600,8030.200," I agree with that"
8030.700,8033.600," but at the same time I think the value"
8034.300,8035.100," of not doing"
8036.100,8036.200," is"
8036.800,8038.500," being undone"
8039.700,8041.000," is that are not doing"
8041.900,8042.900," undead us"
8046.100,8046.500," it's like"
8047.900,8049.000," the whatever that"
8049.900,8053.600," tightness is it is in us that never got enough"
8054.500,8054.600," that"
8055.100,8056.100," it's not all right"
8057.400,8058.600," it needs to be changed"
8059.100,8061.100," however it is it's got to be different"
8061.500,8063.500," and however I am I'm not there yet"
8065.200,8066.100," whatever this is"
8067.000,8067.500," it's not"
8068.100,8068.500," right"
8070.000,8071.100," not quite right"
8071.900,8074.500," and so I've got to get to there where it will be alright"
8075.300,8076.200," whatever that is"
8076.900,8077.100," that"
8078.200,8078.700," not"
8079.200,8081.700," that says not yet not enough not good"
8082.500,8083.100," that"
8083.900,8084.400," is the thing"
8085.200,8086.300," that can be undone"
8087.000,8087.400," by not"
8087.900,8088.100," doing"
8089.000,8094.600," because basically that little formula not yet not right not good enough not enough"
8095.300,8096.000," is what"
8096.600,8098.200," propels so much doing"
8101.400,8103.000," and that can get undone"
8104.400,8105.000," by not doing"
8105.600,8105.900," like a"
8106.700,8107.400," like a knot"
8108.500,8110.100," bit of a complicated knot"
8110.700,8113.500," but actually we don't have to figure out how to undo it"
8114.100,8119.400," it's not like one of those horrible snares I always seem to get when I messing up with string for one reason or another"
8119.800,8120.800," it's not like that"
8121.300,8122.300," you just sit still"
8122.900,8125.900," and it knows how to undo yourself"
8128.300,8129.100," so that's why we do that"
8130.700,8131.200," and that's why"
8132.300,8132.900," it is"
8133.400,8133.800," a"
8134.700,8137.200," you know a noble pursuit as Buddha said"
8138.300,8139.000," to tend"
8140.400,8141.600," basically what ails us"
8142.600,8143.100," by not"
8143.400,8143.500," doing"
8144.400,8145.100," very much at all"
8149.800,8150.100," okay"
8150.900,8151.100," right"
8153.100,8154.700," let's have a little bit of movement"
8155.500,8157.200," and then we're going to a sit loot you want to"
8158.200,8158.500," would you"
8158.900,8159.000," yeah"
8164.700,8166.300," and you can you can wind up"
8166.900,8169.000," uh maybe it'd be good to we'll get up"
8169.200,8171.500," but wind up with us in"
8171.800,8173.000," a space for sitting and"
8173.400,8175.300," and you can just you don't need to sort of end it just"
8176.300,8177.200," just quietly"
8178.100,8181.200," yeah just initiate it or it's close to as you want"
8182.700,8183.600," welcome back"
8188.000,8191.500," yeah everybody can spread out a little bit just see how the left space around you"
8193.500,8194.400," yeah"
8195.300,8196.300," oh that's what you"
8196.800,8197.400," we're saying that's right"
8198.500,8201.200," okay so a little different what we'll do as we start today"
8202.300,8203.000," but also the same"
8203.400,8205.300," for a moment please close your eyes and feel your feet"
8207.200,8208.800," and allow the weight of your body"
8210.200,8212.700," to sink and spread down through your feet"
8214.300,8216.600," and let your very quiet breath be felt"
8217.200,8217.900," through your body"
8218.800,8219.600," in its weight"
8222.600,8224.500," and the initial invitation here is to"
8225.100,8227.600," lift and spread your toes and see how that feels"
8228.700,8230.000," and bend your knees just a little bit"
8230.400,8233.800," from bending your knees see if you can push down into the four corners of your feet"
8234.400,8237.900," and when you open your eyes look at your hands and note if they did the same thing"
8238.400,8241.100," many of them might probably did so allow that to happen too"
8241.500,8242.800," and find your breath here now"
8243.600,8247.000," so this is engagement right so from your fingers kind of draw up your arms"
8247.600,8252.200," and really from your legs all the way down to your feet plug into the ground notice that you might have some heat that"
8252.800,8253.900," begins to show itself"
8254.600,8255.500," and now I'll Shake It Out"
8256.500,8257.800," this is just be a minute and a half"
8259.500,8263.100," in your own Lane you can do this eyes open or eyes closed"
8263.700,8265.500," and if you choose to go eyes closed"
8266.100,8268.200," just for the start of it for the first"
8269.300,8269.800," third of it"
8270.900,8275.100," you can really just be at rest at home in the space of your body and your own skin"
8276.700,8282.000," and so just see where there's tension in your body is you bend it your knees and maybe it shows itself even in your legs"
8283.400,8286.400," and you can kind of like yes and no with your head if you want circles"
8287.600,8288.700," One Direction and then the other"
8290.500,8290.600," and"
8291.200,8292.400," as we get into this"
8293.100,8296.500," second third we're going to kind of increase the pace with the heels lifting"

10075.200,10077.400," whatever it is it's totally still here"
10077.700,10079.400," because it's not about meditation"
10080.400,10080.800," it's about"
10081.800,10082.300," what we are"
10083.100,10083.500," What We Are"
10084.500,10085.500," know what we do what we are"
10085.900,10086.800," and what we do"
10087.700,10089.200," when we're more aware of what we are"
10089.700,10090.100," and do"
10091.500,10093.700," that's slightly different when we're just lost in the doing"
10100.300,10100.600," yeah"
10101.000,10101.500," so"
10104.200,10105.200," yeah we've been"
10107.900,10108.400," gently"
10109.300,10111.800," teasing out some threads of the theme of home"
10112.600,10112.900," and"
10114.000,10114.200," it's"
10115.000,10115.800," some sense of"
10117.000,10118.800," little bit of expiration what it might be"
10119.900,10121.200," and because"
10121.800,10122.100," the"
10123.000,10124.000," path of meditation"
10125.200,10125.400," is"
10126.400,10127.600," always somehow"
10128.600,10129.900," deeper when we look at"
10130.400,10131.000," obstacles"
10132.500,10133.100," and hindrances"
10137.400,10139.200," are deepens when we look at"
10140.500,10141.200," what's in the way"
10142.400,10145.700," and you know that saying the what the obstacle is the way"
10146.800,10149.600," it's very true that's almost sums up Zen"
10151.600,10154.700," there's a there's a there's a line in zen when somebody says"
10155.800,10156.100," before"
10157.700,10158.300," it was all"
10161.200,10161.600," had a good"
10162.900,10165.400," till the cliffs and iron mountains"
10166.900,10167.800," totally impenetrable"
10169.100,10169.600," after"
10171.100,10171.700," I am"
10172.800,10173.600," silver Cliffs"
10174.000,10175.000," and I am mountains"
10176.800,10177.800," no problem"
10178.900,10180.700," the obstacle is what I am"
10182.400,10186.000," and that might sound a little bit abstruse and erudite and weird"
10186.500,10187.100," but another way of"
10187.800,10191.000," coming at it is a story that the Buddha apparently said"
10191.900,10195.300," when a farmer came to him and started recounting all his troubles"
10196.500,10197.200," you know the"
10198.900,10204.100," the cows aren't giving milk and they're no cars this year and the hay is"
10204.600,10206.900," not growing properly there's a drought and"
10207.400,10209.400," my workers are all deserting me and"
10209.900,10215.900," you know my family hates me and the Buddha interrupts and says I know I know I know I know you've got 83 problems"
10216.700,10221.400," and the problems I have 83 how do you know everybody has 83 problems"
10222.500,10224.100," and I can't help me with any of them"
10224.600,10229.600," and the pharmacists but what you know you're the Great Teacher what do you mean you can't help me it says no I can't help me with any of them"
10230.200,10232.600," but you also have an 84th problem"
10233.200,10234.800," and that one I can help you with"
10235.300,10236.400," pharmacist"
10236.700,10238.100," what's my 84th problem"
10238.800,10241.500," and it says it's that you don't want to have any problems"
10244.400,10244.500," yeah"
10247.700,10252.500," so actually what we can do now I thought is again break into pairs"
10253.800,10254.000," and"
10255.000,10261.600," maybe a different person this time I was not hard and fast if you if it's not easy to do that it'd be the same person"
10262.300,10264.500," and and um this time it will be like"
10265.100,10265.400," what"
10265.900,10266.700," stops me"
10267.300,10268.600," being at home"
10269.500,10270.800," or what starts me feeling"
10271.200,10271.600," at home"
10273.100,10273.100," okay"
10274.200,10276.000," so I'll do the bell again"
10277.100,10279.200," a couple of minutes each way and a couple of minutes to"
10279.900,10280.800," to Converse at the end"
10284.100,10286.800," and I'll wait till it looks like you're running group pairs and then I'll"
10287.600,10288.100," in the Bell"
10588.400,10590.600," let's reconvene"
10598.200,10600.000," it's quite something how this little thing"
10602.800,10603.900," really cut through"
10611.400,10613.500," so actually let's some"
10614.200,10615.400," let's invite our"
10616.300,10618.800," good worthy friends gathered online with us"
10619.500,10620.100," any"
10621.000,10624.000," reporting out reporting back from that little"
10625.000,10627.200," sharing and exchange"
10628.100,10630.600," Grant I think you can you can"
10631.300,10633.200," unmute and we'll hear folks in here"
10634.700,10635.300," see if that works"
10649.300,10649.900," okay"
10651.600,10655.400," go ahead online as if you if you'd like to say something please unm"
10661.600,10662.400," and we I'm"
10662.600,10664.600," you know I've been taking a lot of"
10665.300,10668.600," listening to a lot of Talks by you for a long time"
10669.800,10670.000," and"
10671.400,10673.600," this was a wonderful question you asked"
10674.700,10676.800," and the two people I was"
10677.600,10681.800," talking to were so we substantive and nice to talk to"
10682.600,10686.700," they made me think of something that just happened in the last month's"
10689.100,10692.300," I had to move because my husband has probably also"
10693.600,10696.600," I had to move into a an assistant living facility"
10697.500,10700.000," and it felt like landing on an alien planet"
10701.300,10701.300," so"
10702.200,10704.500," we're about three or four months I thought"
10704.900,10707.200," what am I doing here this is not home"
10707.700,10709.400," it just felt so"
10710.400,10712.000," entirely foreign"
10712.300,10712.900," so on"
10713.500,10720.200," and I didn't have a space to work and it couldn't do anything I normally do these people were had nothing to do with me I mean"
10720.800,10722.700," totally different backgrounds"
10723.900,10725.700," but many of them couldn't hold the"
10726.100,10728.900," you know a coherent conversation some could"
10729.500,10730.700," so we're very interesting"
10731.700,10734.300," but it was like oh my god what am I doing here"
10734.900,10737.200," and then finally I turned it around"
10737.900,10738.800," just turned around"
10742.200,10743.200," oh what can I do for them"
10747.800,10747.800," can"
10748.300,10751.000," make them a little hop here say hi when I come in"
10752.600,10753.300," at worked"
10753.900,10754.000," they"
10754.500,10755.500," I really did make"
10756.800,10758.400," friends of just about everything well"
10759.400,10763.100," we're having a trump and non trump war right now but aside for that"
10767.900,10771.900," every so many homes in the land riven by that"
10772.700,10773.000," yeah"
10773.700,10774.900," I'm sustainably"
10775.300,10776.500," and it's I mean you"
10777.500,10778.100," a bunch of people"
10779.000,10782.700," some of whom Were Dying some of whom have a lot of them Ray laws"
10783.200,10784.300," some of whom have other"
10784.800,10785.700," elements that"
10786.300,10787.600," don't affect their minds"
10788.000,10791.800," so they're really with it but you know that you're just not too well"
10792.500,10792.600," so"
10794.300,10796.100," it's a very interesting environment"
10797.000,10799.400," it's just around just turn it around"
10800.500,10803.100," that's wonderful thank you so much for sharing that"
10803.700,10804.700," and then we all learned"
10805.500,10809.300," something really important there were reminded of something really important now"
10810.100,10811.500," thank you so much wow"
10812.500,10812.900," wow"
10813.300,10813.800," wonderful"
10814.400,10815.300," now anybody"
10816.200,10819.500," let's say what about somebody in the room you got the"
10819.700,10821.100," the handheld oh no I've"
10821.300,10822.200," have you yeah you got it"
10822.700,10826.000," anybody in the room could report back a little bit from"
10826.700,10828.400," what emerged in the dialogue"
10834.200,10835.900," like that's a high bar there was"
10842.300,10844.700," yeah but we like the lowly stuff too you know the"
10845.200,10845.900," the low"
10846.100,10846.400," bar yeah"
10848.100,10848.600," no whatever"
10849.500,10850.900," whatever was true for you"
10852.100,10852.400," you don't know"
10853.600,10854.200," thank you Delaney"
10854.600,10854.700," yeah"
10855.600,10857.600," great so I got your name right now yeah"
10859.600,10860.500," microphone yeah"
10862.900,10869.400," and by the way somebody's online who you know get ready if you'd like to raise Your Hand if you if somebody else online would like to share"
10870.900,10872.100," hello Delaney here"
10872.600,10872.800," um"
10874.600,10876.700," it's not on hello you just gotta get really close"
10877.400,10879.000," I spoke with Kristen over here"
10880.000,10881.200," and I we talked about"
10882.300,10883.100," rice I said"
10884.000,10884.300," that"
10885.400,10888.600," when I feel the urge or desire to"
10889.800,10891.300," do something or go somewhere"
10892.100,10894.000," because I feel some sort of inclination"
10895.000,10897.100," usually from a social pressure or a"
10897.800,10898.400," stigma"
10899.200,10899.400," like"
10900.500,10901.600," someone invites you want to hike"
10902.100,10905.500," and you want to go because you want to be able to say oh I want on a hike with this person"
10906.900,10908.100," um old me"
10908.800,10910.800," would have done that and not felt quite as home"
10911.300,10911.900," on that hike"
10913.000,10913.100," and"
10914.200,10914.800," today me"
10916.000,10916.500," says"
10917.600,10920.800," you know what I'm alone right now but I want to go on this hike"
10922.000,10922.700," and thus"
10923.200,10924.300," I feel at home"
10925.600,10925.900," because"
10926.800,10928.100," I made that decision"
10928.700,10929.100," from my own"
10930.400,10932.100," my own accord not from some"
10933.100,10934.900," urge to fulfill some"
10936.300,10937.800," should code wood yeah"
10939.000,10940.200," so that's when I feel at home"
10941.100,10942.000," very very nice"
10942.500,10943.800," so some sense that"
10945.000,10946.700," one of the things that can often"
10947.700,10947.800," sort of"
10948.700,10950.200," perhaps take us away from"
10952.500,10953.400," being a home in ourselves"
10953.800,10954.100," is"
10955.200,10956.300," sort of social pressure"
10957.000,10958.500," yeah could it be something like that"
10959.200,10959.900," where we we"
10961.000,10961.900," lose"
10962.900,10963.300," our"
10963.800,10966.200," anchoring in who we really are"
10968.700,10969.000," because"
10970.500,10971.700," others might not like"
10973.100,10974.000," something like that yeah"
10975.200,10979.500," so maybe I've slightly changed it I said but something like that I think I heard that yeah"
10980.600,10983.100," and or others might think better of me"
10984.600,10986.000," and wouldn't think well of me"
10986.500,10987.600," if I didn't yeah"
10988.100,10989.600," it's very interesting isn't"
10990.200,10993.300," it how both have someone to do with others you know then"
10993.800,10994.800," the first share and"
10995.100,10995.800," and that as well"
10996.400,10996.600," yeah"
10997.800,10999.900," thank you any anybody else online"
11000.900,11002.000," yes Grant can we"
11003.000,11004.200," unmute to raise"
11006.200,11006.300," hi"
11007.500,11008.400," hi Henry"
11008.900,11011.700," I'm I was with Lucia"
11012.200,11013.000," and Tom"
11013.900,11014.000," and"
11015.800,11020.800," we each mentioned a personal trait"
11021.500,11023.100," that kept home from"
11023.900,11024.200," feeling"
11025.600,11026.200," like home"
11028.700,11029.500," self-criticism"
11030.500,11030.800," fear"
11032.200,11032.300," and"
11032.800,11037.900," I was reminded of a quote and I think it was you who put it in my head which is"
11038.800,11042.200," home is the place where you stop running away from"
11043.900,11044.800," and I"
11045.900,11049.800," was so filled with so much self-criticism for so long"
11050.400,11051.200," that I was never"
11051.900,11053.100," at ease"
11053.400,11055.100," and through your meditation"
11056.100,11058.600," of course and my practice"
11059.400,11063.200," I'm starting to find self-compassion"
11063.600,11064.500," and with that"
11065.000,11066.300," a feeling of home"
11067.600,11068.300," so thank you"
11068.800,11071.100," beautiful thank you very much to raise"
11071.500,11073.300," that I'm afraid it wasn't me"
11074.000,11075.500," I wish I wish I could claim that"
11076.400,11081.200," but but I like it home with the place that you can stop running away from"
11082.200,11083.000," that's really good"
11083.800,11085.700," because it's so it applies"
11086.100,11087.200," to right now you know"
11087.900,11088.700," there's a there's a"
11091.900,11093.000," you know there's a famous"
11093.800,11094.800," zen saying"
11096.700,11102.900," I'm sorry if you've heard it before from me because I've used it a lot but the old master was asked what's this then all about"
11104.200,11108.800," and he said when I sit I sit when I stand I stand when I walk I walk"
11109.300,11110.100," when I arrived"
11110.900,11111.500," I arrived"
11112.300,11115.900," and the the question I said well big deal so do I"
11119.300,11123.200," all these years of meditation this great tradition just for that you know"
11124.300,11125.800," and the master said no"
11126.700,11128.900," when you sit you're already standing"
11129.400,11131.400," when you stand you're already walking"
11132.200,11135.900," when you're walking you're already arriving and when you're arriving"
11136.400,11137.300," you're already leaving"
11141.000,11145.300," ah wow yeah so that same the same thing"
11146.500,11149.600," that home is the place that you don't need to keep running away from"
11150.500,11154.000," or was the place the when you're there you stop running away from"
11156.500,11160.600," and I'm feeling it right here that it's right it's obviously right here"
11161.200,11162.000," because it doesn't"
11162.600,11164.300," it doesn't matter you know"
11165.100,11165.800," we're so"
11166.300,11167.200," habituated to"
11168.000,11169.100," oh yeah yeah I get it"
11169.500,11175.300," it's you know and I'm sort of applying it to over there somewhere or next chapter next little"
11175.700,11177.200," sub chapter that's when"
11177.600,11179.400," that piece of wisdom will apply"
11180.000,11180.700," now it's not"
11181.400,11182.400," it applies now"
11183.300,11185.900," it's right now am I running away"
11186.900,11190.700," and it's not to say you shouldn't be running away not at all"
11191.400,11197.200," it's to be with what is happening if it's running away if it's restlessness"
11197.800,11200.000," I can contain that"
11201.700,11202.200," I don't have to"
11202.800,11206.600," be in the place that's not rest this because that's also somewhere else"
11208.100,11212.100," that the cure for restlessness is being with restlessness"
11212.900,11214.600," the cure for impatience"
11215.200,11217.300," is being with impatience"
11218.400,11219.000," it's not like"
11219.500,11221.900," I'm impatient to not be impatient"
11222.800,11226.700," do you see what I mean it's not I've got this impatience thing and I just want to be over it"
11227.000,11229.200," you know"
11233.100,11235.400," right yeah"
11236.800,11238.500," I don't have to be impatient I'm just gonna"
11239.100,11239.700," get over it"
11240.700,11242.800," you know it's actually it's the it's the opposite"
11243.500,11243.700," you know"
11244.200,11247.700," so that's that's really nice there's quite a lot of wisdom emerging already I think"
11248.900,11249.100," thank you"
11249.700,11253.300," any thing else in the room and that anybody would like to share"
11253.900,11255.200," yeah any voices"
11256.800,11257.100," yeah"
11258.400,11262.200," Deborah we we oh poor so important yes yeah put it yeah"
11262.500,11263.400," and then we'll yeah"
11264.800,11265.400," I was trying"
11267.100,11268.000," testing one two three"
11269.000,11269.700," working yeah"
11271.900,11272.800," I was trying really"
11273.500,11274.600," hard after lunch"
11276.400,11276.900," to get it"
11277.200,11277.400," to"
11278.100,11281.500," this may be my last meditation retreat"
11281.700,11282.800," I really want to"
11283.400,11284.000," get what"
11285.600,11286.300," Henry saying"
11286.900,11291.000," and it it it came clear to me that that it was the trying"
11291.700,11293.600," that was standing between me and home"
11294.000,11294.700," and"
11295.600,11299.300," some other teacher once said there's no dower here and"
11299.800,11302.400," I could I could really see that"
11303.900,11306.600," I attribute a lot more to my"
11307.700,11309.800," agency than it's"
11310.300,11310.600," worth"
11311.800,11314.700," thank you for the beautiful"
11315.500,11316.400," the trying"
11317.300,11317.700," to get"
11319.000,11321.100," to wherever I'm sort of supposed"
11321.500,11321.800," to be"
11322.100,11322.300," yeah"
11323.000,11323.200," yeah"
11325.900,11326.500," and again"
11327.300,11327.800," can I"
11328.600,11328.800," be"
11329.500,11329.800," with"
11330.700,11331.400," the triang"
11334.400,11336.000," I always think it's it's like"
11337.200,11341.200," the very thing that I think I've got to heal"
11342.000,11344.200," or get over or not be"
11346.200,11347.400," that actually"
11347.800,11348.100," is"
11350.200,11351.900," what I need to let in"
11352.800,11353.400," see what I mean"
11354.100,11354.600," it's like"
11355.400,11358.600," ah it happens again and again you know I've had"
11359.300,11361.200," many years of my life when I was longing"
11362.300,11364.800," I had this beautiful spiritual yearning"
11366.400,11372.200," to be more spiritual whatever it's whatever the journey is supposed to lead to"
11373.300,11379.200," and you know oh my gosh when it started a Dawn on me that that very yearning"
11379.400,11379.800," Waze"
11380.400,11380.700," it"
11383.600,11384.600," and that it's not"
11385.200,11386.200," somewhere else"
11387.700,11388.300," this"
11389.200,11392.700," you know in and it's the most ordinary moments"
11393.800,11395.000," are already it"
11395.800,11400.000," and you know this this great Zen master yamada Cohen roshi"
11400.400,11402.200," who died in 1989"
11402.800,11405.200," great suspend the 20th centuries are very"
11405.700,11407.200," influentials and master"
11408.400,11413.200," and he had a heated he had a really sort of major Awakening you know real"
11413.900,11416.700," textbooks sort of world fell away and"
11417.100,11417.700," no"
11418.200,11420.800," any any he wrote a beautiful poem about it where he said"
11422.700,11425.500," one night you know I realised all of this the"
11426.000,11427.500," heaven and earth collapsed"
11427.700,11429.000," and we're reduced to dust"
11430.600,11434.800," all my car makes sins were extinguished as if in a bolt of lightning"
11436.700,11437.800," clearly I have seen"
11438.700,11439.600," no person"
11440.300,11441.300," no Buddha"
11442.100,11442.400," no"
11443.400,11443.700," thing"
11444.800,11445.900," and what is it"
11446.500,11447.100," after all"
11448.500,11448.900," nothing"
11449.600,11450.200," special"
11451.300,11451.600," just"
11452.300,11452.700," this"
11453.900,11454.100," just"
11455.400,11455.500," this"
11459.000,11460.300," not his this"
11462.600,11462.800," this"
11467.100,11467.700," see what I mean"
11468.900,11469.700," oh I get it"
11470.100,11471.100," it's that this"
11473.000,11476.400," no no it's this"
11477.700,11481.200," this you actually can't"
11481.800,11482.500," get away from it"
11483.600,11485.100," that's actually the Great"
11485.700,11486.300," mercy"
11487.300,11489.100," you can't actually get away from it"
11490.500,11493.000," well our hearts most yearn for"
11493.700,11495.400," you can't actually get away from"
11497.500,11498.500," it and it's only"
11499.100,11501.900," the little thought that we've got to find it"
11505.600,11505.700," the"
11506.400,11507.200," confuses us"
11508.200,11508.600," the Great"
11509.900,11511.800," early Zen master Joe"
11513.600,11516.100," there's a famous dialogue when he was 18 years old"
11517.000,11518.900," he went to his great teacher and"
11520.400,11522.200," he said what is the way"
11523.300,11524.600," with a capital w"
11525.000,11525.700," and the way"
11526.600,11526.700," is"
11527.400,11527.900," Dow"
11528.300,11531.800," alright it's big it's the it's the way of all things"
11533.200,11537.600," as the ultimate artists what all this is it's a big deal"
11538.800,11541.600," what is the way and nantu says to him"
11542.500,11543.000," you're"
11543.500,11544.700," ordinary mind"
11545.300,11545.800," is the way"
11547.400,11549.500," you're very own ordinary mind you"
11549.900,11550.300," own"
11550.900,11551.700," experience not"
11552.200,11553.900," how do I find my mind wasn't even mind"
11554.300,11555.300," they've just your experience"
11556.300,11558.300," what what you are experiencing right now"
11559.100,11560.100," is the way"
11561.300,11563.700," and Joshua JoJo he's 18"
11564.300,11565.100," it's still a"
11565.500,11566.800," interested doesn't what"
11567.700,11569.500," it's a should I look for it"
11570.200,11572.700," his right you know should I be looking for it"
11573.800,11575.400," and mantuan says"
11576.200,11577.800," if you go looking for it"
11578.300,11578.700," you go"
11579.200,11579.900," against it"
11582.400,11582.900," there's a"
11583.000,11584.800," well how am I supposed to find it"
11588.700,11591.000," and how will I know when I find it"
11592.700,11593.200," it and he said"
11594.000,11594.900," Nancy says"
11596.200,11597.900," the way is not about knowing"
11598.600,11599.400," or not knowing"
11600.500,11601.200," it's not about that"
11603.300,11605.700," when you really reach the way when you really"
11606.200,11606.700," are"
11607.600,11609.400," when you really encounter the way"
11610.000,11610.800," because unfortunately"
11611.700,11613.600," all the above is true is just this"
11614.300,11616.400," but there's one tiny little thing"
11617.000,11619.000," there's one teeny tiny little thing"
11619.500,11620.700," there's one molecule that"
11621.100,11622.100," pops out of the bowl"
11622.700,11623.600," and then it's clear"
11624.300,11626.400," and what that tiny molecule is"
11627.700,11628.900," I'm not sure actually"
11633.100,11634.200," but it might be"
11634.700,11635.500," it might be"
11636.400,11637.600," just the sense that"
11638.200,11639.700," I've got to find it"
11640.300,11641.600," that I have to find"
11646.900,11649.700," it and answer and says you know when when it's clear"
11650.800,11652.100," in a it's it's"
11653.400,11654.200," unmistakable"
11655.500,11656.900," so it says it's vast is boundless"
11657.700,11657.900," and it's"
11658.700,11658.800," it's"
11660.300,11661.400," open as the sky"
11664.100,11665.400," open as the sky but the"
11665.900,11667.100," the crucial thing was"
11668.000,11669.800," do I need to find it"
11670.800,11672.200," or how do I find it"
11673.400,11675.300," and he says if you go looking for it"
11675.800,11676.700," you're going against it"
11683.500,11687.800," well that's a lot of help one of the most supposed to do that"
11689.800,11690.900," well it's yeah I mean"
11692.900,11694.500," zen says just sit"
11695.400,11698.000," you know I mean that's not the only solution that's been offered"
11698.700,11701.800," but one way just every day do a bit of sitting"
11702.700,11703.800," be quiet and still"
11704.600,11706.600," and gradually something"
11707.600,11708.400," in you"
11708.900,11709.200," is"
11710.300,11711.800," receiving the message"
11716.200,11717.800," it's I don't know how to put it"
11718.400,11719.900," and some and sometimes"
11720.600,11721.300," at some point"
11722.200,11727.000," what it is in in US that's receiving the message of being quite and still and"
11727.600,11727.900," just this"
11729.300,11732.400," it's a point we don't realise it it's growing like a"
11733.100,11734.700," underwater"
11735.900,11739.900," rock formation or something like one of those black smokers you know where the"
11740.500,11741.900," the deep in the ocean where the"
11742.800,11742.800," the"
11743.800,11745.800," rocks are forming as a space"
11746.200,11751.600," and whatever the forget that coral bed for me or something it's forming under the ocean"
11752.600,11757.700," and you can't see it because it's under the ocean but it's suddenly it is tall enough a little bit pops up"
11758.800,11759.100," that's it"
11759.800,11762.900," and it just grows you know and you don't really have to do anything"
11764.100,11764.800," they say you"
11765.600,11766.800," when the plum is right"
11767.200,11768.300," it falls from the tree"
11771.200,11773.200," when you can't really rush the ripening"
11775.000,11781.100," but I suppose you can put the pot in the Hot House where it'll grow a bit better and this is the Hot House"
11781.500,11783.100," well practice is the Hot House"
11783.600,11784.300," daily sitting"
11785.200,11785.400," yeah"
11787.000,11787.800," okay"
11788.600,11790.000," any more online"
11792.000,11793.000," okay in the chat"
11794.700,11795.000," oh yeah"
11796.200,11796.500," okay"
11797.900,11799.300," what you've never had"
11802.000,11802.700," what if"
11804.400,11804.700," okay"
11805.400,11810.000," what if you've never had the big Awakening experience is ones practice unfulfilled"
11810.800,11811.500," without it"
11813.200,11814.600," yeah thank you Valerie"
11815.500,11816.300," that's a great question"
11817.900,11819.500," and just seeing if I can"
11820.600,11821.800," find you in it yeah I see"
11822.600,11825.200," okay looks like you've got a lovely carpet there"
11825.600,11830.400," yeah in a big room yeah yeah"
11831.700,11835.500," a very fulfilled carpet yeah yeah"
11836.600,11838.000," that's a great question"
11839.700,11839.800," you know"
11840.400,11843.900," it's so it's so hard this because the truth is a course"
11844.600,11845.300," it doesn't mean"
11845.700,11847.200," anything is unfulfilled"
11848.100,11849.200," you know that's one of the"
11849.800,11851.200," wondrous things about"
11852.400,11853.100," the way"
11853.600,11855.900," is that everything is already fulfilled"
11858.500,11861.200," actually it's very sort of strange thing"
11862.100,11863.600," we're so used to seeing this"
11864.600,11869.700," you know everything a whole human conditioning is about things being not yet fulfilled"
11870.500,11872.100," and we're going to help them to become that"
11873.200,11876.300," and the way is the opposite everything is already fulfilled"
11877.000,11879.600," so the answer is yes your practice is already"
11880.200,11881.100," completely"
11881.800,11882.400," fulfilled"
11882.800,11884.700," it reminds me of another question with"
11885.300,11885.800," jowls"
11888.200,11889.400," he didn't become a teacher"
11890.300,11892.800," why is man that he wasn't until he was 80"
11894.100,11895.600," and lived until 120"
11896.600,11899.200," and I think this is not Legend it's"
11899.900,11900.400," the Chinese"
11901.500,11903.400," Tang Dynasty"
11904.500,11907.100," you know administration kept very good records"
11907.800,11910.600," was born in 778 died in 897"
11911.800,11915.400," so by our counting is 119 by Chinese counting 120"
11916.100,11917.800," when you're one in your first year"
11918.600,11919.400," and he"
11922.100,11926.300," he said I actually I'm sorry right now I can't remember the question"
11926.800,11927.800," yes it was something like"
11928.100,11929.800," how deep is deep"
11932.000,11933.900," which might be a little bit like your question"
11934.500,11936.800," like how deep do I have to go to be deep"
11937.100,11937.900," or something like that"
11938.800,11939.100," and he said"
11940.300,11941.800," do you mean the two of two"
11942.700,11943.900," the six of six"
11944.500,11945.800," or the seven of seven"
11946.900,11948.800," I suppose meaning measuring of depth"
11950.100,11950.400," 2"
11950.900,11951.300," is exactly"
11952.200,11952.500," fully"
11953.000,11953.700," nothing but"
11954.100,11954.300," too"
11955.700,11956.000," six"
11956.400,11957.500," it is exactly nothing"
11958.000,11959.000," but completely"
11960.000,11960.300," six"
11968.300,11968.500," six"
11969.200,11970.000," is perfectly"
11970.700,11971.000," 6"
11972.600,11972.600," or"
11973.300,11975.000," maybe I make it a bit more concrete you know"
11976.000,11976.600," a Hollywood"
11977.400,11978.300," is exactly"
11979.600,11980.100," a Hollywood"
11981.600,11982.000," complete"
11982.900,11983.500," holy Bush"
11984.500,11985.700," a stinging nettle"
11986.200,11987.200," is exactly"
11988.100,11989.200," a stinging nettle"
11989.600,11990.700," completely"
11991.800,11992.400," stinging that"
11994.200,11995.600," and a little primrose"
11996.400,11997.300," that's barely"
11998.300,11999.900," reaching above the path"
12000.400,12001.200," is a perfect"
12002.300,12002.400," full"
12003.100,12003.700," complete"
12004.600,12004.900," total"
12005.300,12005.900," primrose"
12007.200,12007.600," Henry"
12008.100,12008.400," yeah"
12009.000,12009.100," do you"
12009.300,12010.900," mind if I dialogue back with you"
12011.500,12013.100," oh yeah okay let's well let's see"
12013.800,12014.400," give it a shot"
12015.100,12016.900," just be good"
12017.700,12018.100," you just"
12019.100,12021.000," made me feel like I was going to start crying"
12021.700,12022.600," because I think"
12023.400,12026.100," doing our Jewish practice for a long time"
12027.900,12029.600," you still I still"
12030.000,12032.800," feel like there is some thing that's supposed to happen"
12033.400,12037.700," and everything you're saying I know it's totally true in my only experience"
12038.600,12041.000," and I do feel whole and complete as I am"
12041.600,12041.700," but"
12042.500,12045.200," growing up with all the big stories"
12046.000,12049.300," it's still feels like this thing is supposed to happen"
12049.900,12052.900," and so what you just said about every"
12053.700,12058.500," every one is holding complete as they are already in the form they're in"
12059.200,12066.100," and so I mean this question very sincerely and I also feel like it's"
12066.800,12071.800," you know I've practiced mostly in sodas and tradition I feel like it is it's like the rain"
12072.200,12072.600," comes"
12073.200,12075.700," you know it's soaks in over time"
12076.300,12077.400," in that subtle way"
12077.900,12083.800," but I I pose the question totally sincerely to you of what your perception is about that"
12084.800,12085.400," I'll be back"
12087.000,12089.600," that's beautiful Valerie thank you very much"
12090.500,12091.400," I want to just"
12092.900,12094.100," I want to just say"
12095.700,12097.900," I mean it doesn't sound like you may be need this but"
12099.000,12099.600," if you want"
12100.200,12100.200," to"
12101.200,12103.900," just when that feeling comes up"
12104.500,12107.500," that something is supposed to be something else"
12110.600,12111.500," trust that"
12112.100,12113.500," feeling itself"
12114.400,12114.800," in other words"
12115.600,12116.500," don't be persuaded"
12117.300,12122.300," by what it's saying or how it's being interpreted that I have to go I have to get to something else"
12123.000,12125.400," just be with the very feeling"
12126.700,12127.000," what"
12127.700,12129.300," is this sense"
12131.300,12133.900," if you can really be with"
12134.700,12136.500," what is this sense that"
12137.600,12139.100," there needs to be something else"
12141.000,12142.500," just just welcome it"
12143.300,12144.900," and and do you see what I mean like"
12146.200,12146.400," it"
12146.800,12147.600," is itself"
12148.900,12149.500," part of"
12151.000,12151.600," the fulfillment"
12152.400,12153.800," the what is already fulfilled"
12154.600,12155.100," see what I mean"
12155.500,12158.800," even the sense that this is not fulfilled practice"
12159.400,12160.800," that is part of"
12161.300,12161.900," fulfilled"
12162.600,12163.000," practice"
12164.000,12164.200," okay"
12165.000,12167.800," that's I'm not saying it very clear but I think you get the point"
12168.400,12169.300," so we trust"
12170.300,12171.600," whatever arises"
12174.800,12175.300," basically"
12177.400,12179.100," yeah okay I mean in our practice"
12179.900,12180.100," yeah"
12181.200,12181.300," okay"
12182.200,12185.600," I hope I hope I got that alright I think that's what I meant to say yeah"

12211.900,12215.300," we can be very thankful I say to what we've heard from"
12216.200,12217.300," from the room and from"
12217.900,12219.300," the zoom room as well"
12221.700,12221.900," yeah"
12224.600,12225.500," thank you very much for"
12227.200,12232.000," offering what you've offered and doing the exercise the two exercises so far"
12233.400,12233.500," yeah"
12235.400,12235.800," so let's"
12237.000,12237.600," let's just"
12239.800,12240.900," be quiet for a little bit"
12244.100,12244.200," so"
12246.300,12246.500," um"
12247.100,12248.400," we'll come back into"
12251.500,12252.300," a seated posture"
12261.100,12261.900," I have another sit"
12274.500,12276.400,"actually sorry just a moment"
12276.800,12277.600," let's um"
12278.200,12281.800," Luke could you give us two or three minutes of just some standing"
12282.200,12282.500," thing"
12283.300,12285.300," I think that would be really nice yeah let's stand"
12286.100,12286.200," yeah"
12287.200,12287.800," I'll do a little bit of"
12312.800,12315.600," this is an I know but a goodie Henry really"
12316.700,12319.100," like this one himself so we put your hands on your hips"
12319.900,12321.900," and you can just kind of sweat side to side"
12324.000,12325.100," you can look down at your feet if you want"
12325.600,12328.300," and then you can start to make slow motion kind of hula hoop if you would"
12331.200,12331.300," and"
12332.500,12333.700," work from the ground"
12335.600,12339.000," but also feel the amount of sky and space"
12339.900,12341.300," from your feet to the crown of your head"
12342.200,12343.300," like you're drawing a circle"
12344.000,12345.200," on the Ceiling"
12348.600,12349.500," and then switch directions"
12355.300,12357.200," and then just for a couple of"
12358.700,12359.000," circles"
12359.500,12363.200," looked down and really feel where you're placing weight from your heel to your toes"
12364.200,12367.800," big toe to pinky toe to heel to heel to pinky toe to big toe"
12370.400,12371.500," and see how it feels to"
12372.300,12374.700," put some flair into it and put your hands like this"
12378.300,12381.600," and instead of doing circles now you can just kind of like side to side"
12384.300,12385.400," just smooth breathing"
12392.600,12397.300," and if you'd like you could kind of lean and just do a lift up of an elbow just for a little bit of a side body stretch"
12398.700,12402.800," not too much push and not too much force and you might even bend the knee to the side that you"
12403.600,12405.800," lift the elbow up with just for ease"
12407.100,12407.900," for lastic"
12412.200,12413.600," and then we'll take the hands and go like this"
12414.300,12415.700," as long as you can and your shoulders"
12419.900,12421.400," and then stop the swaying and"
12422.000,12429.000," let the weight sink from where your palms are facing up all the way down into your feet and take a smooth quiet breadth from your feet up to your palms"
12431.700,12433.800," right and then take your hands here and in front of you"
12435.200,12435.500," and so"
12436.200,12439.600," pull the skin on the tops of your palms Apart by your fingers that are there"
12440.100,12442.300," a little bend in the elbows help so that you might feel that that um"
12443.100,12447.400," gets your traps in your shoulders lift up a little bit you can drop your head down a little bit and you can bend your knees"
12447.900,12449.000," kind of sit towards the chair"
12449.900,12451.500," and breathe into the rounded upper back"
12454.400,12457.000," and then you'll stand up and reach your hands all the way up"
12458.700,12462.200," and then when you breathe out your hands can come behind you they can go either to your hips"
12463.100,12467.900," together behind you or a Palms all the way together with the elbows kind of pulling towards each other"
12468.800,12472.200," and the same thing here the other direction but just like subtle sways of the hips"
12473.000,12475.500," and you start to sink down into the four corners of both feet"
12476.200,12477.700," and a nice arched upper back"
12478.000,12478.800," and a good breath here"
12481.100,12483.100," and then you can take your hands down onto your thighs"
12484.000,12485.200," and you can drop your head down"
12485.700,12487.100," just look between your feet"
12487.600,12488.900," take a couple good breaths here"
12492.900,12494.100," you might feel from"
12494.900,12499.500," your hands on your knees over your heels kind of breathing all the way up into your armpits"
12502.200,12509.600," you might really feel that you can breathe into the back of your lungs take one more breathe into the back of your lungs and into your inner crossbows back of your ribs nice"
12511.100,12511.600," really good"
12513.000,12513.900," and then you can stand up"
12514.700,12517.100," just do a little shakeout just an easy shake out"
12521.800,12521.900," good"
12524.000,12524.100," right"
12539.200,12540.900," okay thank you very much Luke"
12542.700,12543.300," okay so"
12544.700,12546.500," let's let's get let's get into"
12547.500,12549.500," position whatever we want it to be"
12551.000,12551.100," for"
12556.600,12560.000," and before you think you're starting to meditate"
12561.000,12561.200," just"
12561.600,12563.200," sort of be with how"
12563.800,12567.900," it is already right now just to just to just to be"
12569.200,12572.900," tuning in to just being right now how it is right now"
12574.200,12576.800," and know that this is already meditation"
12578.700,12579.400," you're already in it"
12582.200,12584.600," and all it is is a time of just"
12586.700,12587.300," being with"
12588.700,12589.200," being with"

12955.800,12956.400," that this"
12957.500,12957.700," is"
12958.800,12959.100," enough"
12973.100,12973.700," and if it"
12974.700,12975.900," doesn't seem possible--"
12979.100,12981.100," and I be with"
