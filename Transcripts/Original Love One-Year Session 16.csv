160.500,162.200," little sequins we've been doing"
162.700,163.100," where we're"
164.200,167.200," we've taken this phrase that actually it's a phrase from"
168.000,169.600," you know deep in the Zen tradition"
172.100,173.800," Mount is rivers in the great Earth"
175.500,181.300," it's got a particular resonance in the Zen lineage that I'm part of sambo zen because"
182.600,183.400," one of the Great"
184.000,186.100," 20th century masters in the lineage"
186.700,187.600," Cohen yamada"
188.300,188.700," who did this"
189.500,191.100," very calligraphy I have behind me here"
191.700,195.900," of the word shin which means both mind that it's commonly translated and means"
196.400,196.800," heart"
197.200,198.400," a single single"
199.400,199.900," human"
201.500,203.100," core of humanity that"
203.600,205.900," is not divided into mind and heart in"
206.900,211.800," the older Chinese view and Japanese as well and East Asian generally"
212.500,212.900," and perhaps"
214.200,216.800," Asian on Buddhist altogether some"
217.300,219.000," some heart of who we are"
219.900,220.800," shin you know"
221.300,221.700," um"
222.600,224.800," but he Cohen llamada had this"
225.300,227.000," great Awakening experience"
227.900,230.700," they're really profound experience"
232.900,233.700," single"
234.000,236.200," interestingly you know zen has this"
236.900,239.500," emphasis on the single experience that can"
240.500,241.800," be so transformative"
244.200,247.500," and other traditions are more progressive in their view"
248.300,248.800," of how this"
249.400,250.500," operation of"
252.400,253.200," how the how the"
254.200,254.600," how the"
255.100,256.800," process of Awakening happens"
257.600,263.400," and there's certainly a place for progressive and gradual cultivation as well and then"
264.000,264.500," very important"
265.200,268.900," in fact but still at the can be decisive moments"
269.500,270.900," and in his case"
272.300,274.700," in the case of coin yamada he was um"
276.000,278.500," he was on a train and he was contemplating"
279.400,280.300," a line"
280.600,284.300," that that a little quote from scripture the mind of wisdom"
285.100,286.300," is nothing but"
287.000,289.000," the sun moon and stars"
289.700,290.800," the mountains"
291.100,291.600," rivers"
292.300,293.300," and the great Earth"
294.700,295.400," and somehow"
296.300,298.900," Conan might have had this in his mind and he couldn't shake it"
299.600,301.900," he just kept it throughout this train journey"
302.600,305.200," I think it was commuting home he worked in a hospital"
305.800,306.300," he was the"
307.000,308.900," boss in a hospital in Tokyo and"
309.800,311.900," he was riding her as he did every day"
312.400,313.000," to"
313.600,314.200," kamakura"
314.900,316.200," where he lived"
316.900,319.100," and on the train this line just"
320.200,322.900," somehow wouldn't let him go or he wouldn't let it go"
323.900,328.400," I came and and and and he the mind of bright wisdom"
328.700,333.000," is nothing but the sun moon and stars the mountains"
333.500,334.000," rivers"
334.400,335.500," and the great Earth"
336.100,336.800," that actually"
338.200,338.700," somehow"
339.500,341.000," this thing this shin"
342.300,346.200," that we think of as being sort of in here whether it's chest or head it's"
346.800,349.900," or both it's you know think of it as being in the core of Us"
350.800,352.000," but this line is saying"
353.400,355.400," what that very core is"
356.200,357.700," is nothing but"
358.100,358.600," the sun"
359.200,360.900," moon and stars"
362.000,363.100," you know that are so"
363.400,366.500," manifestly it would appear outside of Us"
367.300,370.900," but actually that this shin this heart mind is nothing but"
371.300,374.400," the sun moon and stars the mountains rivers and the great Earth"
375.000,375.200," and"
376.700,378.000," and he he was just"
378.500,378.900," somehow"
379.800,383.200," to the lenses were almost aligned he was trying to get what this"
383.900,385.200," what is this mean and"
386.100,391.200," when home there were there were family friends staying actually in the house they had an evening together"
391.800,392.600," he went to bed"
393.500,394.800," and woke up"
395.300,396.600," boom in the middle of the night"
397.800,398.200," suddenly"
399.000,402.400," he just woke up I mean in the normal sense of the word out of sleep"
403.600,405.100," under the ordinary kind of sleep"
406.000,407.000," and in fact"
407.400,410.300," at the instant he woke up that way he woke up"
411.000,412.000," the other way as well"
413.100,414.900," and he suddenly realised"
416.000,416.500," that it was"
416.900,418.200," absolutely true"
419.600,422.300," what this this what this line was saying wasn't"
423.100,423.900," metaphorical"
425.000,427.800," Luke just a quick question have we got everybody muted"
429.000,432.100," and could you make me a co-host just in case"
432.800,433.600," double yes"
433.800,434.100," okay"
434.500,435.300," great um"
436.000,439.500," and you know he suddenly woke up and just realized"
440.000,441.800," what it was truly saying"
442.700,443.300," which was that"
444.400,445.600," this world"
446.300,447.300," he was perceiving"
448.600,448.900," had"
449.500,450.800," always been"
452.500,453.000," actually"
453.600,454.200," inseparable"
455.200,455.900," from who he was"
457.000,458.500," it was actually what he was"
458.900,459.400," he wasn't"
460.300,461.400," what it taken himself to be"
461.900,463.000," he was all of this"
463.700,466.300," and and he he said that"
467.600,468.600," it was a"
470.900,471.900," everything collapsed"
472.300,472.400," and"
473.100,474.200," crumbled and"
474.500,475.100," disappeared"
475.900,478.500," and out of that disappearance came a veritable"
479.300,479.800," hurricane"
480.500,481.200," of delight"
481.900,482.400," and joy"
483.200,484.300," and he couldn't stop"
485.900,486.900," banging the floor"
487.700,492.500," he says sat up and stamping and banging the floor think it's true it's true"
493.200,495.300," the ancestors haven't deceived me"
495.800,498.600," in a world it meaning that all this this long tradition of"
499.300,503.200," Buddhism and Zen and you know the the way these teachings have come down"
503.800,504.100," it"
504.300,506.000," was actually true"
506.500,509.800," and the purpose of all this practice that he'd then been doing for"
510.500,512.400," quite some time a couple of decades"
513.000,513.900," probably at least"
514.600,516.500," he suddenly realized that it was"
517.400,517.900," simply"
518.600,519.200," absolutely"
520.000,520.500," true"
521.500,521.700," and"
524.200,525.300," his family"
526.500,527.300," particularly his wife"
527.900,529.000," and then one of his sons"
530.200,535.200," well you know woken up very worried they thought he was going mad because he couldn't stop laughing"
536.100,536.300," and"
538.100,539.300," and he sort of"
539.900,544.700," he just couldn't be sort of brought back down to earth as it were"
545.100,548.000," you know or well actually that's totally the wrong way to put it"
548.500,552.600," he couldn't be brought back into sort of normal way of"
554.000,554.600," being"
556.300,560.100," and and the visitors who were staying the night were very disturbed"
561.100,565.300," and and then basically in the in the morning you know he had he he"
566.100,567.100," he had calmed down"
568.100,568.600," and he"
569.500,572.800," but he was still trembling and weeping and sweating and"
573.500,573.700," and"
574.700,576.200," and he went to see his teacher"
576.700,579.800," or maybe the next day I remember he went to see his teacher who"
580.400,581.900," lived in a temple nearby he went"
582.500,584.000," in early dawn"
584.200,585.400," to see his teacher who"
586.600,590.300," and told him he still could he said he could hardly speak when he tried to speak"
591.200,591.900," his lips"
593.100,593.300," just"
594.600,596.100," tremble and he could only mumble"
596.800,598.200," and he was weeping and weeping and he"
598.900,600.000," laid down on a"
600.200,602.600," floor in front of his teacher who patted him on the back"
603.600,606.800," I said it's it's very good it's wonderful wonderful"
607.700,608.400," to realise"
609.500,611.100," as profound as he have"
611.800,613.700," and and it was a Turning Point"
614.500,616.900," for him and people who studied with him"
617.400,618.200," as a"
618.600,618.900," actually"
619.400,623.100," two of my own teachers did John Rick Rossi and Ruben habit of Rosie"
623.600,627.400," they said you know and others of David Lawyers talked about this as well the to be"
628.000,628.900," in his presence"
629.700,632.700," years later was like being in the presence of a mountain"
633.300,634.100," of compassion"
635.600,636.900," a mountain of compassion"
637.700,637.900," and"
639.400,642.900," you know it's not like he continued to live in that"
646.300,646.900," emptiness"
648.800,651.700," and it's not like he continued to live in a state where he couldn't"
652.000,652.900," form words"
655.600,655.900," but"
656.500,657.600," something had been"
658.800,659.400," knocked away"
660.800,662.300," that didn't come back"
664.600,665.600," not only that though"
666.100,667.800," he didn't stop practicing"
668.900,672.100," it's not like he didn't continue to do his meditation"
672.700,674.000," his co- training"
674.400,676.100," which he hadn't finished is somewhere"
677.500,679.900," close to finishing by then but he hadn't finished"
680.800,681.100," and"
683.900,684.100," it"
685.600,689.600," it allowed him to really all he wanted to do was try to share this"
690.200,691.000," with others and"
692.000,693.400," and he in time became"
694.000,695.900," one of the Abbots of the lineage"
697.400,698.500," had a lot of Western"
699.600,703.100," students actually this was in the starting I guess in the"
704.000,706.000," late 60s and into the 70s and"
707.000,708.100," 80s and onwards"
709.700,710.900," he died in 1989"
711.800,712.600," at the age of 81"
713.600,716.600," and you know the the process of"
718.200,720.400," of all of this is still going on of"
721.600,725.700," the kind of unfolding of this clarity about the way things are"
726.400,728.100," is continuing through all of us"
729.200,729.400," and"
730.700,731.100," and we"
732.100,735.200," we have this kind of North Star"
737.400,737.700," of"
738.100,740.400," that kind of clarity that kind of"
741.500,743.400," thorough Awakening being a possibility"
744.500,748.500," but in this original love program and the program on the way app"
749.300,749.700," we actually"
750.400,752.500," we we we don't want it to be"
755.400,758.400," the high bar we have to jump over"
759.700,762.800," we we're happy for it to be a North Star"
763.600,764.300," that we know is"
765.100,765.400," somehow"
766.900,770.900," not a delusive experience at all but a discovery of a"
771.400,772.700," of the way things really are"
773.900,775.300," but we don't want to be"
777.100,777.900," pursuing it"
778.600,779.500," and seeking it"
779.900,781.100," and grasping for it"
781.600,783.700," in a way that actually sort of"
784.800,786.300," is trying to leap over"
787.900,789.400," how things actually are for us"
790.400,791.000," right now"
792.000,794.700," quite the reverse actually we really want to be"
797.200,798.500," relaxing into"
799.500,800.500," sinking into"
801.900,802.200," just"
803.500,805.100," this moment as it is"
807.200,809.400," and the path is a little bit of a"
811.000,813.700," illusory kind of thing that we seem to think that"
814.200,815.600," we're here something like that and we think"
816.000,818.600," are well he was following the past to get to that"
819.800,820.200," but actually"
821.000,822.200," I don't think that's right"
823.200,824.200," it's more like"
824.900,826.500," all the practices had been doing"
827.800,829.400," was allowing him to settle"
830.000,830.200," more"
830.900,831.200," and more"
832.200,832.600," and more"
834.400,836.400," and release more and more"
837.500,838.000," and more"
839.300,841.200," until there was just nothing left"
842.300,843.100," to release"
844.300,844.700," and"
846.100,846.600," finally"
847.800,852.300," a set of last Strand you know if you think of taffy being Pulled Apart"
853.200,857.000," how it into it as he separate the taffy you have these"
857.600,858.500," strands"
859.100,859.900," in a connecting"
860.800,861.600," two- parts and"
862.100,865.200," eventually you're down to one tiny STR"
866.600,867.700," and at some point"
870.000,871.300," with very little effort"
871.900,873.700," that last Strand may just"
876.100,876.600," snap"
877.600,878.800," or just drop Away"
880.500,882.100," and it's all just open"
883.500,883.700," and"
884.800,886.900," it's something like that process that we're"
887.700,891.100," maybe that even that could be a misleading images mostly just"
893.300,893.900," releasing"
894.600,895.100," releasing"
896.400,896.700," just"
898.400,898.700," now"
900.100,900.700," nothing else"
902.100,902.200," so"
903.400,904.800," it seems to be a path"
905.200,907.300," but it really makes maybe more like"
909.000,909.600," a ball"
909.900,910.500," rolling"
912.500,912.800," around"
914.800,916.100," I don't know if you know these um"
917.100,917.900," in Old"
918.700,920.400," fun fairs as we call the book"
920.700,923.300," in the UK we call them fun fairs with"
923.700,926.000," you know Ferris Wheel and Dodgers and"
926.900,928.700," and helter skelter and"
929.100,930.200," all that sort of stuff you know what I mean"
930.600,933.000," carnivals in the in the US roller coasters"
933.700,935.400," um that there used to be these"
936.100,940.100," doors where you could drop coins in different machines and one of the things"
940.600,943.500," was just a big kind of cone inverted cone"
943.700,944.400," Kone"
944.900,946.200," and the penny would roll"
947.500,947.900," down"
948.600,950.200," towards the hole in the bottom going"
951.000,955.300," round around and tighter and tighter circles as it descended this cone"
955.900,958.600," and eventually it just dropped through the bottom"
959.000,961.100," it's a bit more like that that we've got this sort of"
961.600,963.200," all this movement all this"
963.900,968.300," momentum that we're that we're carrying our bodies and Minds and our shin"
969.500,971.300," and eventually we might just"
974.500,974.700," drop"
976.500,977.400," drop write down"
978.400,979.000," into the middle"
980.100,981.600," into the middle of of everything"
983.200,983.300," and"
984.100,984.300," then"
985.000,986.100," we see what we find there"
986.700,987.900," you generally be"
988.900,989.400," surprising"
990.400,992.100," so that's why we do a lot of sitting"
992.500,993.100," because sitting"
994.000,995.000," is about being still"
996.000,996.500," it's about"
1001.100,1005.400," it's about being still and letting the momentum of mind heart body"
1006.500,1007.900," have a kind of place"
1009.300,1011.500," where it can discharge itself"
1013.000,1014.500," and so we we just you know"
1015.300,1016.000," it's like we"
1016.700,1021.500," on one level when we're sitting so we're going to get to a sit in a moment I didn't mean to talk quite so long but"
1022.000,1025.500," at the start but and one level when we sit"
1025.900,1026.700," in a we've we're"
1027.400,1028.100," everything still"
1028.900,1029.700," we're joining"
1030.800,1032.100," the stillness of the great Earth"
1033.600,1033.900," and"
1034.600,1035.800," on another Level we still got"
1036.700,1038.000," simental momentum"
1038.700,1039.700," emotional momentum"
1042.200,1044.800," physiological momentum in our in our bodies and"
1045.600,1046.900," muscular momentum"
1047.800,1049.300," settle muscular tensions"
1049.900,1050.600," of momentum"
1052.400,1056.600," so we both got the stillness and we got this sense of something moving"
1057.900,1058.200," and"
1060.600,1061.700," through the practice of"
1062.600,1063.200," being still"
1065.400,1066.300," the momentum is"
1067.500,1068.100," gradually"
1068.600,1069.100," settling"
1070.600,1070.800," and"
1072.100,1074.800," we gradually come to the point where"
1075.300,1076.200," we can suddenly"
1077.000,1077.700," join"
1078.400,1083.500," the stillness and when we do we realize that the momentum actually was only ever"
1085.100,1086.700," part of the stillness really"
1087.600,1089.200," wasn't really what it seemed to be"
1090.300,1094.700," okay so I don't know whether that's particularly clear or not but let's let's get into a sick"
1098.900,1099.200," so"
1100.100,1103.300," come into you know a comfortable position and you can"
1103.900,1105.600," take your time doing that you don't have to"
1106.500,1108.400," rush into being perfectly still"
1109.800,1111.100," not your body settling"
1121.500,1122.200," yeah just"
1125.400,1126.300," that body be relaxed"
1131.600,1133.900," if you are upright then make sure that your balance"
1136.500,1138.400," you can close the eyes or lower the gaze"
1150.700,1151.700," just getting comfortable"
1162.900,1164.900," not just check in with yourself"
1165.500,1166.400," we want this to be"
1168.100,1170.500," a sort of a special time in a way"
1172.500,1173.200," as many"
1173.600,1175.400," things we might do during the day that"
1177.300,1179.600," we can sort of do in a mindful way"
1181.200,1181.400," but"
1181.700,1182.300," this is not"
1182.900,1184.600," just one of those it's"
1186.300,1188.400," it's time to be with"
1189.300,1189.800," yourself"
1199.900,1201.600," so kind of see how you're doing"
1211.700,1215.100," and whatever you find if there's a way that it's uncomfortable"
1220.400,1220.600," don't"
1221.500,1222.600," don't push that away"
1228.000,1229.800," can you can you tap into"
1231.400,1232.700," a way of being kind"
1234.900,1235.500," to yourself"
1241.100,1241.700," letting this"
1243.000,1244.600," time with yourself being"
1246.000,1247.300," be a kind of welcoming"
1248.200,1248.600," time"
1249.600,1249.900," for you"
1266.500,1268.000," welcome yourself as you are"
1274.500,1276.900," if you need to adjust your body please do"
1283.800,1285.900," you can do some micro swaying"
1286.700,1287.300," if you'd like"
1288.600,1291.700," doge and said it's always good to start a sit with some swaying"
1296.300,1299.500," if you'd like you can try rotating the body gently"
1300.300,1302.100," going in little circles"
1303.000,1303.500," around"
1305.200,1305.900," a central"
1307.000,1308.800," axis or plumb line"
1309.800,1311.700," going gently round and round"
1316.700,1318.500," at a speed that feels good for you"
1324.800,1325.900," relax your hands"
1332.600,1335.000," and if you are swaying or rotating"
1336.400,1338.100," let the movements get smaller"
1339.900,1341.400," smaller and smaller"
1344.300,1346.300," Let It Be Little micro movements"
1348.900,1351.100," that you're just sensing in your seat"
1353.000,1354.900," and you can kind of feel the spine"
1357.200,1360.200," doing these little rotations or Swayze"
1365.600,1366.000," and then"
1367.900,1370.100," see if you can just let that come"
1370.800,1372.100," to rest"
1373.300,1374.100," in the middle"
1378.100,1384.200," and you know if you were rotating try doing it now in tiny tiny movements the other direction"
1397.300,1398.000," no really"
1399.100,1401.100," giving yourself a chance to"
1402.700,1403.700," find your way"
1407.100,1407.900," to stillness"
1413.500,1414.000," well"
1415.300,1417.000," relax our old friend the jaw"
1424.400,1425.900," and the throat and the neck"
1437.200,1437.900," letting go"
1444.600,1445.800," shoulders and arms relaxed"
1451.500,1452.600," soft barely"
1465.100,1466.400," sensing the gentle"
1468.000,1471.200," kind of bellows motion in the belly"
1472.600,1473.200," but the breath"
1483.200,1484.000," gentle"
1486.100,1487.800," swelling and diminishing"
1501.600,1504.600," while we can rest the gaze the inner gaze"
1505.300,1506.000," in the belly"
1515.200,1515.500," letting"
1518.200,1519.300," the breath come and go"
1524.300,1526.400," but really we're just watching that"
1526.900,1528.400," motion that action"
1530.200,1530.800," swelling"
1532.400,1533.500," and diminishing"
1544.300,1547.400," sometimes that they're wants to be a pause"
1548.800,1550.400," between exhale and inhale"
1551.900,1553.200," at the end of an exhale"
1556.700,1558.100," see if you can let the"
1559.800,1561.300," the belly do what it wants"
1575.700,1577.700," sometimes breasts might want to go a little"
1578.600,1579.500," and little faster"
1581.800,1583.200," sometimes slower"
1589.000,1590.700," sometimes with a pause"
1607.500,1609.400," just letting it do what it"
1609.500,1610.400," it wants to do"
1611.200,1611.800," by itself"
1631.700,1636.500," sometimes that can be something with breath practice that happens where"
1637.700,1639.700," we can't help somehow but"
1640.400,1644.300," grip a little bit around it it may be rather subtle grip"
1646.400,1649.600," a subtle muscular contraction around the breast"
1656.200,1660.100," if if you're finding that just know it's perfectly natural"
1661.300,1662.500," quite common action actually"
1666.400,1667.700," and it's perfectly okay"
1680.000,1680.700," a little"
1681.300,1684.100," light gripping if it's there let it be welcome"
1687.800,1689.600," acknowledge it and welcome it"
1708.900,1712.200," let it be welcome let it in a way be loved"
1735.100,1737.300," notice that there's a kind of space"
1740.400,1742.800," within which breath is happening"
1748.000,1748.800," so there's this"
1750.100,1752.800," ongoing gentle pulse"
1754.700,1755.000," of"
1756.100,1757.300," feeling and emptying"
1763.000,1765.900," kind of swelling and dwindling"
1775.100,1777.600," there's somehow it's happening in"
1779.200,1782.200," a kind of broader wider awareness"
1783.200,1784.100," or space"
1804.600,1805.600," and that space"
1806.900,1810.000," really allows it to function freely"
1813.300,1816.200," am I occasionally be a larger breadth"
1818.900,1821.300," but longer breath or slower breath"
1823.900,1825.300," and a quicker breath"
1830.800,1831.800," sometimes I kind of"
1832.500,1834.100," micro PSI"
1834.400,1835.000," might happen"
1844.000,1844.900," these are all"
1846.200,1847.700," sort of indicators of"
1848.700,1849.600," settling down"
1855.300,1857.200," or we could save tapping into"
1858.500,1859.400," a more settled"
1860.600,1862.500," place a more settled space"
1865.100,1865.900," and at the same time"
1867.600,1869.300," less settled parts are"
1870.800,1872.500," invited to be as they are"
1874.100,1875.500," and find their way"
1877.900,1878.400," to release"
1879.500,1880.200," what they need to"
1883.100,1884.800," and then time to join"
1887.200,1888.400," the settled nest"
1889.900,1891.500," that they do it in their own time"
1969.500,1970.700," and you imagine that"
1971.400,1973.300," you don't have to do anything"
1977.400,1979.700," right now in this meditation"
1981.600,1983.900," there is no right or wrong way"
1985.500,1986.300," for it to be"
2001.600,2003.500," what would it be like if you were"
2005.700,2007.200," fully holi"
2008.400,2009.000," welcome"
2010.500,2011.500," in this moment"
2013.300,2014.500," just as you are"
2017.700,2018.600," just as you are"
2071.700,2072.600," slowing down"
2088.000,2089.800," not trying to get somewhere"
2109.500,2111.500," now I'm trying to get anywhere"
2174.700,2176.000," what if there's"
2177.600,2179.600," nothing to Seoul"
2196.400,2198.300," what if all is"
2199.700,2200.600," apparent"
2201.800,2202.300," and clear"
2204.200,2204.700," right now"
2207.000,2207.900," just like this"
2344.500,2346.000," but if all me"
2346.800,2349.300," riddles and questions of life"
2351.300,2353.300," Are somehow sold"
2355.600,2355.900," here"
2361.300,2362.500," in this quiet"
2366.200,2367.100," and silence"
2432.200,2433.700," what if there's a kind of"
2434.600,2435.600," auditory"
2435.900,2436.700," wired"
2440.300,2441.500," that's the background"
2442.800,2443.900," to all sounds"
2474.200,2477.900," what if there's another kind of quiet"
2479.200,2481.100," a greater choir"
2484.700,2485.400," silence"
2487.600,2488.800," that's the background"
2490.300,2491.500," to all life"
2539.700,2541.200," over this there's a"
2542.100,2544.800," background to all experience"
2548.200,2549.400," that's a vast"
2550.300,2550.900," Cho"
2646.900,2649.000," what if right here now"
2650.600,2651.800," there is a kind of"
2653.100,2654.000," act drop"
2655.300,2656.800," to all our exper"
2659.100,2660.100," background"
2668.700,2670.400," like a great silence"
2688.500,2689.400," and sir"
2689.700,2690.700," sir great peace"
2751.400,2752.600," in asks nothing"
2754.000,2755.500," in US nothing of Us"
2797.400,2799.800," kind of like a great rest"
2805.400,2806.600," and yet has a"
2808.100,2810.200," kind of Potent energy"
2810.900,2812.000," also in it"
2845.000,2845.700," They're gonna"
2849.100,2850.300," we're gonna I'm gonna go"
2850.800,2852.500," quiet for a bit as we"
2853.300,2854.100," he's into"
2855.600,2856.200," a gap"
2857.500,2858.700," and feel free to sit"
2859.200,2859.500," on"
2861.600,2863.700," or pause and make a cup of tea"
2864.100,2864.400," something"
2865.300,2866.100," whatever you need"
2867.100,2868.500," will reconvene"

3286.900,3288.300," season as it were more"
3289.000,3289.800," mini course"
3290.100,3291.400," on on this theme"
3291.900,3293.100," Mount is River is great us"
3294.100,3295.200," and I think our next"
3295.700,3296.000," little"
3296.300,3296.900," module"
3297.600,3300.800," I think it's going to be septembar 15th that it starts and it'll be"
3301.500,3301.700," I think"
3302.800,3304.400," a a four-part"
3305.300,3307.200," mini series that's the plan so"
3307.800,3309.200," you'll hear more shortly"
3310.600,3311.400," through email"
3312.100,3314.300," and those of you in the app it'll go up in the app as well"
3315.900,3320.000," and as will that David Whyte event that I'm doing with David"
3320.400,3323.000," here in Santa Fe a morning together actually"
3323.900,3324.800," by the way"
3325.300,3325.400," so"
3326.100,3326.700," so now"
3327.100,3328.800," let me see what I can share"
3329.300,3330.400," on this theme I the"
3331.000,3334.600," in the the you know I think you're all familiar with this sort of"
3335.200,3337.000," four zones structure"
3338.100,3339.300," that the"
3339.900,3342.600," we can look at so many things in practice from"
3343.300,3343.600," from"
3345.200,3346.200," I think it's a reasonable"
3346.800,3351.900," categorisation sort of four buckets you know four areas for ends I call it"
3352.500,3353.900," in my book original love"
3354.600,3354.900," um"
3356.900,3358.100," or kinds of"
3358.800,3360.700," help that practice can give us"
3361.700,3362.500," and um"
3365.600,3371.900," I've talked so far in the first two sessions mostly about the the first and the second with"
3372.600,3373.200," inevitable"
3374.100,3377.500," touches on the 4th and the first is about mindfulness"
3379.100,3383.300," being a sort of allowing our present moment experience"
3384.600,3385.600," finding that there's a"
3386.500,3388.100," there's an awareness already here"
3389.000,3391.300," that we have mindful awareness that's"
3391.900,3393.200," that's able to welcome"
3394.400,3396.300," and and even"
3397.700,3399.100," allow and love"
3400.000,3401.200," immediate experience"
3401.800,3405.300," under more and more conditions you know and more and more kinds of"
3405.700,3407.700," content that there might be an experience"
3408.400,3410.500," this awareness has a capacity to"
3411.100,3411.800," hold all of it"
3412.800,3417.400," and then secondly we explore our connectivity our connectedness"
3418.200,3419.600," are non-independent"
3420.900,3422.000," in multiple ways"
3422.900,3425.200," both sort of material and"
3425.700,3429.500," somewhat immaterial or most both tangible and less tangible"
3432.000,3435.500," and then in in the third zone we we explore absorption"
3436.000,3438.400," and becoming more"
3439.700,3442.900," intimately absorbed in experience Here and Now"
3443.700,3448.100," this is you know akin to flow state so I've talked about that quite a bit elsewhere"
3449.000,3454.800," and then the fourth zone is is Awakening like like yamada Cohen's experience I mentioned earlier"
3455.600,3460.300," which he actually wrote about both soon after it happened"
3461.800,3464.800," and I was I was kind of paraphrasing some of that letter"
3465.200,3469.700," he wrote it in a letter to a friend another Zen master so in nakagawa roshi"
3470.100,3470.300," actually"
3471.100,3472.500," somebody might have heard of"
3473.000,3474.200," he wrote a letter to him"
3474.700,3477.500," a few days later or week later something like that"
3478.300,3481.600," describing what had happened and I was kind of paraphrasing from that earlier the"
3482.200,3484.500," you know this the the the the set of really"
3485.000,3487.100," dwelling on this quote you know the"
3487.500,3489.500," the mind is nothing but the"
3490.400,3492.600," sun moon and stars the"
3493.600,3498.900," the mountains rivers and the great Earth the mind of wisdom is nothing but this this world"
3499.700,3500.900," and then him sort of"
3502.400,3505.200," being caught by that phrase somehow and then suddenly it"
3505.600,3506.700," it just released"
3507.200,3508.100," everything and"
3508.800,3509.400," and he"
3509.900,3510.500," he he"
3511.300,3512.400," everything disappeared and"
3512.800,3519.600," and and and so he and and and so I wrote a he wrote this letter about it that I was kind of paraphrasing earlier bits of it"
3520.100,3523.200," which is a actually is in my book written love as well"
3523.700,3524.300," but um"
3525.200,3528.900," but but he later many many years later"
3529.400,3532.100," four years before he died actually he wrote a poem"
3532.900,3533.400," also"
3534.100,3538.000," so that a celebrating that moment and it's and it's important in his life it was"
3538.600,3539.300," for him it was like"
3540.000,3540.200," the"
3541.200,3543.400," Pivot on which his life turned"
3544.200,3546.700," and he was 47 years old at the time and"
3547.200,3549.900," when he was 77 he wrote this poem that goes like this"
3550.800,3553.500," once an ancient Buddha said"
3554.400,3558.400," the mind of wisdom is nothing but the sun moon and stars"
3559.200,3561.500," the mountains rivers and the great Earth"
3562.400,3563.200," one night"
3563.800,3565.000," I realized this"
3565.800,3566.600," all of a sudden"
3568.300,3569.400," heaven and earth"
3569.700,3570.300," collapsed"
3571.000,3571.800," and were reduced"
3572.700,3573.200," to dust"
3575.500,3578.900," all my karmic sins were extinguished as if"
3579.400,3580.300," in a bolt"
3580.600,3581.400," of light"
3582.800,3583.400," clearly"
3583.800,3584.700," I have seen"
3586.000,3586.900," no person"
3587.700,3588.900," no Buddha"
3589.800,3590.100," know"
3591.000,3591.400," thing"
3593.700,3594.900," and what is it"
3595.700,3596.400," after all"
3597.900,3598.900," nothing special"
3600.300,3601.200," just this"
3602.700,3603.000," just"
3604.200,3604.500," this"
3608.500,3609.800," look into my eyes"
3611.300,3611.800," they don't"
3612.500,3612.900," speak"
3615.400,3617.100," and they are void of any"
3617.800,3618.400," anxiety"
3621.800,3622.700," and the bottom he said"
3623.700,3625.400," old man Cohen"
3625.700,3628.500," yamada old man of 77 years"
3629.300,3630.300," Cohen yamada"
3636.700,3639.500," and what is it after all nothing special just this"
3640.000,3640.200," just"
3640.900,3641.000," this"
3643.100,3643.800," isn't that nice"
3645.100,3646.400," compassionate reminder"
3647.700,3648.300," just this"
3649.000,3651.800," Justice not somewhere else not something else"
3652.500,3655.100," not something remote to be attained one day"
3655.700,3656.500," just this"
3658.300,3663.800," so okay so yeah I my promise was that today we do a bit more of a focus on the"
3664.200,3665.000," fourth zone"
3665.300,3666.000," The Awakening"
3666.700,3668.900," the non-dual the non-separable"
3669.500,3671.100," and I want to get us there"
3671.700,3674.100," rather swiftly by a little little"
3674.900,3677.700," we've already touched on it earlier in this session but"
3678.200,3678.900," a little bit of a"
3679.600,3681.800," little mini journey there which is um"
3682.700,3685.800," first of all I wanted to say something about"
3686.700,3687.300," you know"
3688.600,3689.200," why"
3694.800,3695.100," why"
3695.800,3696.100," being"
3696.800,3699.100," how and why you know being in"
3699.800,3700.800," nature being"
3701.500,3703.600," recognising our connection to nature"
3704.100,3709.100," can be so helpful I mean obviously on one level it's just because it's real you know we just are"
3709.400,3711.400," part of the hole biosphere obviously"
3712.200,3713.200," and yet you know"
3713.600,3718.900," as I've said before like walking a park or going to the woods going to the forest go to the ocean"
3719.900,3722.600," go the to the to the mountains and"
3723.400,3725.700," very commonly we feel better"
3727.100,3727.700," um"
3728.200,3735.200," and I wanted to quote a little bit from this lovely book that many of you probably know a tale for the time being by Ruth"
3735.700,3737.200," ozeki it's a novel"
3738.000,3741.300," that some they're very steeped in Zen"
3742.800,3743.500," she lives up in the"
3743.900,3745.300," Pacific Northwest because actually"
3746.300,3749.400," I think part half Japanese I think I kind of exactly remember"
3750.900,3752.600," and there's a real serious practitioner"
3753.100,3755.900," but she she has a little bit in this book when"
3756.700,3757.100," um"
3759.300,3761.500," she's got to know her Japanese grandmother"
3761.900,3763.700," that the main character is a teenage"
3764.200,3766.200," Japanese girl whose brought up in California"
3767.200,3768.900," and she's got to know her Japanese grandmother"
3769.400,3771.700," and she is discovering more and more about her life"
3772.200,3773.100," and one of the"
3773.600,3773.800," big"
3774.300,3777.800," the big event in this grandmother's life really was that she lost her son"
3778.500,3779.800," as a kamikaze pilot"
3780.200,3782.100," in in the first in the Second World War"
3782.800,3783.000," and"
3784.900,3785.200," she"
3786.500,3791.600," she's she's trying to the grand daughter's she's called now and ayo"
3792.200,3794.800," is is trying to sort of understand her grandmother"
3795.500,3797.100," and and she says that when"
3798.500,3798.800," when"
3800.200,3800.500," um"
3801.200,3805.000," her son was drafted into the special forces and forced"
3805.400,3808.100," to become a kamikaze of pilot fighter pilot"
3809.200,3810.900," how must she have felt"
3811.900,3812.200," and"
3813.000,3813.900," now says"
3815.000,3818.300," it's the cold fish dying in your stomach"
3818.700,3819.100," feeling"
3821.400,3822.000," that feeling"
3822.900,3826.500," that she gets which we would probably diagnose as anxiety"
3827.100,3829.100," but she says it feels like there's a fish"
3830.100,3831.900," flopping about in her stomach"
3833.300,3838.100," and you try to forget about it but it soon as you do the fish starts flopping around under your heart"
3838.800,3841.000," and reminds you that something truly horrible"
3841.600,3842.200," is happening"
3843.200,3844.000," gico"
3844.800,3849.700," the grandmother felt like that when she learned the her only son was going to be killed in the war"
3850.400,3853.900," I know because I told her about the fishing my stomach"
3854.900,3857.100," and she said she knew exactly what I was talking about"
3857.900,3859.800," and that she had a fish too"
3860.400,3861.200," for many years"
3862.200,3862.700," in fact"
3863.300,3866.000," she had she said she had lots of fishes"
3866.800,3869.100," some that were small like sardines"
3869.600,3872.500," some that were medium-sized like carb"
3872.900,3873.800," and other ones"
3874.400,3876.500," that were as big as bluefin tuna"
3877.400,3878.900," but the biggest fish of all"
3879.700,3881.100," belonged to her son"
3882.200,3884.400," and it was more like the size of a whale"
3885.800,3886.800," she also said"
3887.400,3889.700," that after she became a nun"
3890.400,3893.100," she joins a little tiny monastery in the mountains"
3894.100,3896.600," after she became a nun and renounced the world"
3897.300,3898.100," she learned"
3898.600,3900.400," how to open up her heart"
3901.300,3902.500," so that the Whale"
3903.000,3903.900," could swim away"
3905.700,3907.600," I am trying to learn how to do that"
3908.000,3908.200," too"
3911.200,3913.000," so I think that's rather a beautiful"
3913.800,3914.800," Eva vacation"
3915.500,3915.700," of"
3917.000,3920.800," you know in the novel that this grandmother g cos she she"
3922.200,3927.300," walks as a moment when she's walking up this long long path and then stairway into the mountains"
3927.800,3930.300," up to this little temple among all among the trees"
3931.300,3936.200," and she she suddenly finds a Kind of Peace and over time"
3937.200,3938.900," she recognises that"
3940.700,3941.500," she's entered"
3942.300,3944.900," into a kind of context of peace"
3945.600,3947.000," and in that context"
3947.500,3949.800," her heart softens her heart opens"
3950.300,3951.700," and that great whale"
3952.000,3955.600," of her deep concern for her son and her loss of her son"
3957.500,3958.900," the Whale can swim away"
3959.400,3960.800," it's a very beautiful image I think"
3961.400,3962.000," and I'm"
3962.500,3965.800," wanting to kind of invite the possibility that put the"
3966.200,3970.000," the invitation that the conjecture the contention that"
3970.500,3972.600," something like that happens to us when we"
3973.600,3977.200," deliver ourselves to a sort of natural context it's like we've"
3977.700,3979.000," we've come back to"
3980.000,3982.800," a home for us to a belonging that"
3983.300,3986.300," you know our very bodies have and our nervous systems have"
3987.100,3990.500," in this world for which they have actually evolved which is"
3991.200,3993.100," basically the Natural World you know"
3993.700,3996.900," and of which we're part and we come back to that"
3997.400,3999.100," and the same thing can happen to us"
3999.900,4002.200," that our anxieties and stresses"
4004.500,4004.800," can"
4005.400,4009.200," you know again even just a evening walk or a morning walk"
4010.100,4011.700," through a park can do"
4012.400,4015.300," it and we see the sky over here in the clouds and the"
4015.900,4018.100," the changing colors of Dawn and"
4019.000,4020.700," and of the evening and"
4021.400,4025.900," we sense that you know we're part of this world that has his own rhythms and has its own"
4027.700,4032.000," its own kind of order and processes that we're part of and"
4032.600,4033.600," recognizing that"
4034.300,4034.900," like"
4036.900,4038.300," well it recognizing that"
4038.700,4039.100," brings"
4040.100,4043.600," a kind of belonging in a wider context that allows"
4046.400,4046.600," the"
4047.200,4050.200," the the the trapped fish flapping around in our"
4051.000,4052.200," in our hearts in our"
4052.700,4053.200," bellies"
4054.700,4055.100," to swim"
4056.000,4057.800," into this broader context"
4058.300,4059.700," we get a taste of peace"
4060.300,4060.400," so"
4061.400,4061.700," that's"
4063.700,4068.900," a much observed phenomenon about being in nature many people report it"
4070.000,4073.000," but I think it's also hint as to why"
4073.700,4074.400," practice"
4074.800,4075.700," can do the same thing"
4076.500,4077.700," because we're coming into"
4078.800,4080.400," a stillness and a quiet"
4081.000,4081.200," that"
4081.500,4083.800," that most other things are operating in"
4085.800,4087.600," ultimately everything's operating it"
4089.000,4089.400," and we"
4090.300,4091.600," we come back into"
4093.100,4094.500," a context of choir"
4095.800,4097.200," the background choir"
4098.700,4100.200," that everything's operating"
4100.800,4102.200," manifesting within"
4103.300,4106.700," and we may not get a full you know we don't have to have a"
4107.700,4108.200," blinding"
4109.800,4111.800," Road to Damascus revelation"
4112.700,4113.400," we don't need that"
4114.200,4114.500," we just"
4115.000,4116.600," have the context of a bit of stillness"
4117.900,4119.900," but in alignment with a broader stillness"
4120.800,4121.200," and we get"
4123.200,4124.200," we get some he's"
4124.600,4125.200," some ease"
4128.200,4129.700," and that's"
4130.700,4131.300," kind of"
4132.000,4135.700," how zone one works and it's also kind of how"
4136.400,4137.200," zone 2"
4137.800,4138.200," works"
4138.900,4139.200," this is"
4139.800,4141.000," Finding us ourselves in the"
4141.900,4142.700," in the in the"
4143.800,4144.800," recognising our"
4145.800,4146.400," place"
4146.900,4147.000," in"
4149.700,4151.000," our belonging this in"
4152.100,4153.400," the Natural World"
4155.700,4158.800," but there is more"
4159.700,4162.000," and I want to just now quote a bit from"
4166.800,4169.000," from shinzen young actually who's"
4169.600,4169.800," very"
4170.400,4172.000," good and clear about these"
4173.000,4174.700," I don't know whether he"
4175.100,4178.000," exactly agree with me about these four zones"
4178.900,4181.000," but in more or less would I think because"
4182.900,4183.100," there's a"
4183.700,4187.100," thing I I read recent in his book the science of Enlightenment"
4188.000,4189.500," which is very very"
4190.300,4193.200," very good book actually I think on on meditation"
4194.000,4194.200," and"
4195.300,4199.700," I believe I'm just checking actually at the front yeah I think it was edited by"
4200.500,4201.800," Michael taft"
4202.300,4202.400," Who"
4203.900,4205.900," is being on on this program"
4206.900,4208.300," a couple of times anyway"
4209.000,4209.600," is the sort of"
4210.600,4213.500," friend of the original love program and the way app"
4214.300,4214.400," and"
4216.000,4217.200," anyway so to some sort of"
4217.600,4218.100," shins and"
4218.900,4219.300," thoughts"
4220.800,4221.500," arranged and"
4222.500,4224.000," edited to some degree"
4225.400,4226.400," buy a Michael"
4227.100,4229.100," who used to be the managing"
4229.900,4232.300," editor and publisher I think could sounds true"
4232.800,4233.500," who published the book"
4234.800,4235.500," just checking yeah"
4236.200,4236.300," and"
4237.800,4238.400," in this"
4239.200,4242.000," book somewhere shins is talking about shamanism"
4243.200,4246.100," and he says I like to refer to shaman as"
4246.600,4249.000," shaman and shamanism as that really"
4249.500,4250.200," old time"
4250.500,4251.700," religion of this planet"
4252.500,4255.300," even relatively old religions like Hinduism and Judaism"
4256.000,4257.600," have only been existence for a few"
4258.300,4261.300," have only been in existence for a few millennia shamanism"
4262.100,4264.400," the natural religion of tribal humanity"
4265.000,4267.800," is at least 20,000 years old probably much older"
4268.500,4269.800," no one knows for sure"
4270.800,4275.200," in the big picture the natural religion of our species has been shamanism"
4277.000,4278.900," I think in a certain sense We Almost Have to sort of"
4279.300,4280.400," question the use of the word"
4281.500,4285.800," religion here sort of natural way of humanity seems"
4286.600,4289.500," in its understanding has been shamanism"
4290.100,4294.400," and compared to it all the other religions of the world are New Kids on the Block"
4295.300,4298.000," within shamanic cultures there's often a distinction"
4298.700,4300.900," between the path that is oriented"
4301.500,4303.300," towards special powers"
4304.300,4305.700," that's to say getting to"
4306.900,4308.400," interact with and know"
4309.100,4309.800," what he calls"
4310.400,4313.100," Powers the sort of special entities that"
4313.700,4314.200," that can"
4315.300,4317.700," be met in the collective unconscious essentially"
4318.700,4318.800," and"
4320.100,4323.900," which you know we talked about in the original love the book fair bit"
4325.500,4327.100," and so he says there's a there's a"
4327.900,4331.200," there's a there's a distinction between the path of that kind of practice"
4332.000,4336.000," and the path that is oriented to Ward ego transcendence"
4336.600,4338.000," the path of the powers"
4338.300,4340.000," brings knowledge of the Spirits"
4340.800,4343.600," but the other path brings knowledge of the Great"
4344.100,4344.400," spirit"
4345.400,4347.000," and the great spirit is actually"
4347.900,4349.100," sort of the same thing"
4350.400,4351.900," in his understanding as"
4353.700,4354.200," emptiness"
4354.600,4355.700," in Buddha in Buddhism"
4356.500,4356.800," he says"
4358.200,4358.500," in"
4358.900,4359.900," the among the lakota"
4360.900,4364.100," that he is trained in actually in and the Western Sue"
4364.600,4366.600," says in their language they have two words"
4367.100,4368.400," pejuta which has"
4369.100,4370.800," a & which Asha wakhan"
4371.200,4372.200," and the pejuta"
4372.500,4373.600," means medicine"
4374.000,4374.400," or power"
4375.300,4376.900," which Asher is a person so a"
4377.500,4378.700," Vegeta was sciascia"
4379.200,4379.700," which hasher"
4380.000,4381.600," is literally a medicine person"
4382.300,4383.300," or a person with power"
4384.200,4386.100," wakaan on the other hand means"
4386.700,4388.500," the great mystery or the great spirit"
4389.400,4391.300," so we chash a wakhan"
4392.100,4392.800," is a person"
4393.600,4395.300," whose shamanic or deals"
4395.900,4397.200," have taken them beyond"
4398.100,4398.500," self"
4400.300,4402.600," in other words within the shamanic view"
4403.400,4403.600," there's"
4404.200,4405.900," two things going on one is"
4406.800,4407.800," getting to know"
4408.700,4410.300," the entities and powers of the"
4410.600,4411.700," of the animistic"
4412.500,4413.400," world you know"
4414.200,4415.500," and that's great"
4416.200,4416.600," that would be"
4417.500,4420.000," one part of our zone two in"
4420.700,4424.200," in the the way the original love view"
4425.700,4426.400," and there's also"
4428.000,4428.600," getting to know"
4429.300,4429.700," the Great"
4430.200,4430.700," mystery"
4431.700,4432.600," beyond self"
4433.500,4434.800," see in the in the first"
4435.400,4436.000," there's still"
4436.600,4437.800," some kind of self"
4438.600,4439.500," interacting"
4440.000,4441.000," with some kind of other"
4442.300,4443.100," but in the second"
4444.000,4447.300," is beyond self is beyond self and other"
4448.000,4448.500," in fact"
4449.100,4449.900," the mind"
4450.300,4451.100," is nothing other"
4451.700,4453.000," than the sun moon and stars"
4453.600,4455.100," the mount is Rivers the great Earth"
4455.700,4457.200," the sun the mind"
4457.900,4458.400," is not"
4458.800,4459.700," other than"
4460.300,4461.000," the mountains"
4461.900,4462.800," it's not other than"
4463.600,4464.000," the River"
4464.700,4465.600," is not other than"
4466.100,4466.400," the Great"
4467.000,4467.400," Earth"
4470.100,4471.600," beyond self and other"
4472.700,4475.700," he actually goes on says the Buddha said essentially the same thing"
4476.500,4478.100," he had a student who was"
4478.500,4481.000," fully enlightened fully liberated like himself"
4482.000,4486.500," but the populace doubted that the person was and are had fully enlightened"
4487.700,4492.200," because he didn't have any special powers the people came to the Buddha and said what's the deal here"
4492.700,4494.900," he can't levitate he can't tell us the future"
4495.600,4496.700," he can't heal people"
4498.200,4502.000," the Buddha responded by saying that they didn't understand the nature of the path"
4502.700,4506.800," liberation is dimensionally independent from these powers"
4507.700,4510.300," the Buddha confirmed that the our hat was liberated"
4511.200,4513.600," but his path had not involved any unusual"
4513.900,4514.700," experiences"
4515.500,4516.100," that actually"
4516.600,4519.900," I mean it makes it really makes total sense sort of"
4521.500,4522.600," conceptually because"
4523.200,4524.200," the point about"
4528.800,4530.700," the liberation from self and other"
4531.500,4536.100," is the realization that they're one in the same and when we realize that they're one in the same"
4537.300,4541.700," the the it was somehow the opposition of self and other"
4542.300,4543.100," that made"
4543.700,4544.100," the world"
4544.500,4545.000," seem"
4545.600,4547.500," that that occluded"
4547.900,4548.900," is transparency"
4550.100,4552.100," that that made it hard to see"
4553.000,4553.700," is emptiness"
4555.100,4556.200," and actually"
4557.100,4557.500," when we see"
4558.400,4558.800," your mother"
4563.000,4566.000," I don't want to overload you with book titles but he says you know"
4566.500,4571.200," when truly when we really see the emptiness of self"
4571.800,4575.200," we also see the emptiness of all things and when we really see"
4575.900,4577.100," the emptiness of all things"
4577.700,4579.200," we see the emptiness of self"
4580.000,4581.200," that that's why"
4581.800,4583.500," that particular experience he had was so"
4585.400,4587.100," life-changing because both"
4588.200,4589.200," completely fell away"
4590.300,4592.900," both self and world completely disappeared"
4593.700,4595.000," which is not to say"
4595.600,4598.100," it's actually a bad way of putting it it would imply that"
4598.600,4600.700," they were there and they both vanished"
4601.300,4601.400," and then"
4602.500,4606.000," perhaps in some way they both came back because he managed to carry on with his life"
4606.500,4607.200," still being a busy"
4607.900,4611.900," hospital administrator in in the central central Tokyo and"
4612.500,4614.300," and rearing a family and so on"
4615.100,4622.800," um it's it's actually not that they go away is that we see what they've been all along that there is a level on which"
4623.300,4623.800," truly"
4624.700,4627.100," all of this is a kind of dream"
4627.800,4629.300," it's a it's an appearance"
4630.300,4631.800," it's a multifarious"
4632.600,4635.400," Collider scopic and marvellous appearance"
4636.300,4636.400," and"
4638.000,4639.800," as is my sense of self"
4640.500,4640.700," so"
4641.400,4644.200," but you can if you if you understand it that way you can see why"
4645.100,4646.200," just seeing"
4646.800,4648.200," through the appearance"
4649.400,4649.700," doesn't"
4650.600,4651.600," mean that"
4652.400,4653.100," it actually"
4653.900,4656.100," has to be sort of eliminated"
4656.500,4657.700," it's not about that"
4658.400,4659.800," it's about seeing"
4660.600,4660.900," that it was"
4661.500,4663.300," what it's really been-- all along"
4664.200,4666.600," and then the liberation that that can bring"
4668.500,4670.300," in the way we continue"
4671.300,4671.400," to"
4672.800,4675.100," navigate it or respond to it or"
4676.400,4677.300," treat it as"
4678.500,4679.200," if it's real"
4680.100,4681.300," there's a lovely term that"
4682.000,4683.600," the the targeter"
4684.200,4684.900," which which"
4685.500,4689.300," is a little bit difficult to translate and you'll find if you're curious about this stuff"
4689.900,4692.200," in Buddhism you'll find very translations of it"
4693.300,4696.300," that which thus comes is one"
4696.900,4697.500," translation"
4698.300,4700.800," I've never really quite got my head around that but"
4701.300,4703.400," there's a great Chinese Zen"
4703.800,4704.500," teacher called"
4705.200,4706.800," sheng yin Master sheng Yen"
4707.600,4708.400," and he said"
4710.800,4712.200," his translation of it was"
4713.200,4715.000," that which comes as if it comes"
4716.100,4718.500," that which arises as if it arises"
4719.300,4720.700," so in other words and he said"
4721.300,4725.800," we even if we've seen that things are kind of merely Appearances"
4726.400,4728.800," we must treat them as if they're real"
4729.900,4734.900," and and so that which arises as if it arises"
4735.500,4737.900," would be wouldn't it sort of would apply to everything"
4738.400,4741.200," because everything we know is a rising as if it's a rising"
4742.700,4744.400," I hope that making that clear so"
4744.900,4747.300," the the wisdom in that is just profound"
4747.900,4749.600," for my point of view because it's both"
4750.400,4751.000," wisdom"
4751.700,4752.900," in the sense of"
4753.400,4757.300," seeing the way things really are that they're only arising as if they're arising"
4758.300,4761.200," but it's also with wisdom of a pragmatic kind"
4762.000,4763.100," that they arise"
4763.600,4766.000," as if they are arising and we must"
4766.600,4769.000," respond as if they are a rising"
4770.100,4771.300," that I don't know if I make any sense"
4772.400,4778.100," I'm not sure I hope so you know but it's really it's so valuable to realize that"
4779.300,4781.900," actually basically to me what it's saying is"
4782.600,4784.100," yes all of this"
4784.500,4785.500," multifarious"
4786.700,4787.000," world"
4787.800,4790.800," including my even my sense of me"
4791.900,4792.700," is a rising"
4793.400,4795.100," and actually it's just"
4796.000,4797.300," Appearances and I would say"
4798.200,4798.700," any"
4799.100,4799.500," moment"
4799.900,4803.600," of Awakening and maybe not just moments any Awakening"
4804.800,4805.600," clarifies that"
4807.200,4807.900," and yet"
4808.700,4809.700," it doesn't mean"
4810.700,4811.100," that we"
4813.800,4814.600," we've entered"
4816.100,4818.000," a terminal void"
4819.200,4819.900," not at all"
4820.700,4821.900," it means we're"
4822.300,4822.700," given"
4823.600,4825.200," we're granted we're"
4826.200,4826.700," in"
4827.000,4829.100," in in in imbued with"
4832.600,4833.300," part of love"
4833.800,4834.200," basically"
4835.600,4837.300," it means we can"
4838.000,4838.800," approach it all"
4840.100,4840.600," with love"
4843.600,4848.200," I don't know if the logics absolutely clear I hope it's kind of clear because it becomes this"
4849.000,4849.700," cherishable"
4851.100,4851.700," appearance"
4852.600,4853.500," you know that's why"
4855.000,4859.100," that's why it's always said in especially in mahayana Buddhism the"
4861.100,4867.700," I'm worried that I'm being a bit too technical mahayana tata Turner anyway let me Anna is"
4868.800,4874.200," the former Buddhism of which zen is a part and Tibetan Buddhism is also a part and"
4874.700,4878.600," it's a little bit later than the very early Buddhism from around 2000 years ago"
4879.400,4880.800," that's why in in"
4881.600,4886.300," mahayana Buddhism it's always said that you know there are two wings of practice"
4887.100,4887.500," wisdom"
4888.300,4889.000," and compassion"
4890.000,4890.800," and really"
4891.700,4893.700," you know you can't fly if you don't have both"
4894.900,4897.100," and a bird can't fly without both and"
4897.800,4903.200," without both wings and that's what this part is about and I see some kind of Echo of that"
4903.900,4906.500," in this car track metaphor actually where"
4907.100,4908.100," on the one hand"
4908.700,4909.300," there's one"
4910.000,4910.700," Wheel track"
4913.600,4918.200," and suddenly concerned that not you don't know all know what I mean by the cartrack metaphor"
4918.800,4920.700," it's in my book originally love"
4921.200,4926.100," and I talked about it on the way a bit and I talked about it in in these original last session's quite a bit"
4926.700,4931.000," but the it's the early Chinese Buddhist notion that"
4931.500,4933.800," the path of practice is like a car track"
4934.100,4935.700," with two wheel tracks"
4936.400,4937.700," one Wheel track"
4938.300,4940.400," is the path of gradual development"
4941.200,4942.200," the human being"
4942.700,4944.200," through cultivation"
4944.800,4946.600," of ever deepening mindfulness"
4947.300,4947.900," the other"
4948.400,4949.000," Wheel track"
4949.500,4950.900," is the reality"
4951.500,4953.400," of Awakening is the reality"
4954.000,4954.200," of"
4954.900,4955.600," no self"
4955.900,4956.400," no other"
4957.600,4958.300," inseparable"
4959.100,4961.400," no Ford no backward no up no down"
4962.100,4963.300," no here and there"
4964.200,4964.400," no"
4965.000,4965.300," no"
4966.100,4967.300," path actually"
4968.300,4969.300," no path you know"
4969.900,4971.200," the pathless path because"
4972.300,4972.800," there's only"
4973.400,4973.600," this"
4974.200,4975.400," one this"
4976.400,4976.600," and"
4977.800,4977.900," so"
4979.100,4980.600," there's a compassion"
4981.500,4981.800," in the"
4982.700,4983.100," in the"
4983.500,4986.200," gradual cultivation the gradual development"
4987.000,4987.600," that we need"
4988.600,4989.800," then they talk about"
4990.500,4993.500," the student of the way being like"
4995.800,4997.800," a piece of wood on a lathe"
4999.100,5001.700," you know lay there's a rotating device and"
5002.200,5003.700," and the craftsman works"
5004.600,5005.300," the lathe"
5005.700,5006.600," to shape the wood"
5007.400,5009.000," there's a gradual shaping"
5010.200,5010.400," and"
5011.500,5012.500," on the other hand"
5012.900,5013.400," there's"
5014.200,5015.500," the reality of things"
5016.000,5016.700," no self"
5017.200,5017.800," no other"
5018.600,5020.600," as your mother can put it no person"
5021.400,5022.100," no Buddha"
5023.100,5023.700," no thing"
5024.600,5026.400," no person no Awakening"
5027.300,5028.300," no Awakened one"
5029.500,5031.900," how could there be without a person you know no person"
5032.400,5033.300," no Awakened one"
5033.700,5034.300," no thing"
5036.200,5037.900," and on the other hand"
5038.800,5039.200," there's this"
5040.300,5040.900," ordinary"
5042.200,5042.700," just this"
5043.200,5044.000," nothing special"
5044.500,5045.000," just this"
5045.600,5046.200," just this"
5048.600,5049.100," and of course"
5050.300,5050.700," really"
5052.600,5053.300," then on actually"
5053.800,5054.300," two things"
5056.000,5056.300," either"
5059.300,5059.400," and"
5060.400,5061.000," this is where"
5062.000,5063.800," the kart track metaphor also"
5064.400,5064.700," helps"
5065.200,5065.500," perhaps"
5066.800,5067.300," a cart"
5068.200,5068.600," is one"
5070.200,5070.800," the others"
5071.000,5073.100," there's two wheel tracks but the cart itself"
5074.100,5074.500," just this"
5075.500,5076.100," one cart"
5077.400,5079.000," not too carts one card"
5080.600,5081.200," so we're being"
5081.700,5083.600," with beggar entering practice"
5084.100,5085.300," repeatedly where"
5085.700,5086.200," we're being"
5087.400,5088.800," presented always with"
5090.100,5090.300," both"
5091.100,5091.400," wheel"
5091.800,5092.200," tracks"
5093.200,5093.800," the reality"
5096.100,5097.300," the reality of"
5098.500,5099.300," the inseparable"
5100.500,5102.300," and the reality also of the"
5103.200,5103.600," of the"
5104.500,5105.200," developable"
5106.500,5108.000," beautiful human"
5108.700,5110.800," troubles and difficulties and"
5111.400,5114.000," challenges and shortcomings and fall abilities"
5115.600,5118.000," the errors of our ways that we can work on"
5118.600,5118.800," you know"
5120.000,5121.200," mercifully we can work on"
5122.400,5125.400," and sometimes yeah we have very hard things in life"
5126.500,5127.200," and those can"
5128.100,5130.900," actually end up propelling our"
5131.200,5131.500," growth"
5140.100,5141.600," okay I'm going to pause there"
5142.700,5148.900," and let's see if any questions are coming up I'm just diving into the chat so anybody could raise a hand"
5149.600,5151.300," or could put a question in the chat"
5152.400,5153.700," the novel"
5155.200,5156.400,"oh somebody thank you"
5157.000,5158.000," carry for putting that in"
5158.800,5160.900," yep and Dingle as well thank you"
5161.300,5162.300," yeah hi Joe"
5163.400,5165.100," let's see if we can get you on muted"
5166.300,5167.500," I Henry yeah"
5168.000,5168.500," hi yeah"
5169.200,5169.500," I am"
5170.300,5171.600," thank you again for a wonderful"
5173.000,5174.400," guided meditation and talk"
5175.000,5180.000," I I was doing small amounts of meditation for about 10 years"
5181.600,5184.000," daily but there is small and it wasn't until I"
5184.800,5187.500," found your guided meditations in January that"
5188.200,5188.500," I felt"
5189.000,5190.800," an enormous change in how"
5191.400,5192.500," I was relating to"
5193.300,5194.300," this practice and"
5195.000,5197.700," so grateful for the capacity to join in"
5198.500,5201.000," by zoom and via your app and"
5202.800,5205.000," living Brazil when a place where there's no"
5205.600,5206.400," zen medicine"
5207.300,5209.500," that I can find"
5210.500,5212.600," so my question is with"
5213.200,5215.500," feeling quite a lot of growth going on in this"
5216.000,5217.200," practice in sitting"
5217.900,5218.700," and thinking about"
5219.600,5222.200," as we all want to take that into our"
5222.800,5224.200," daily lives and"
5227.300,5234.400,"uh there's a I think I have a lot of the experience of absorption that you described in the kind of Third part"
5235.000,5235.100," and"
5236.900,5237.000," and"
5237.700,5238.500," I can feel that"
5239.200,5243.000," seeping into my life as well in different ways and occasionally"
5243.800,5244.100," kind of"
5245.000,5246.600," almost deliberate and"
5247.600,5251.400," times in the day when I'll kind of allow that to come as well"
5252.300,5252.400," but"
5253.500,5255.000," at the same time when one"
5255.400,5256.900," or for myself or say when I"
5257.600,5260.700," kind of step out from a sitting down and"
5261.200,5262.700," meditating a can feel"
5263.400,5265.500," kind of the world rushing back in and"
5267.200,5268.400," and my question is about"
5269.100,5272.100," my own experience of that being very visual"
5272.700,5272.700," so"
5273.800,5280.000," as you commonly assumed I practice with eyes shut and he giving"
5280.600,5283.800," suggestions to others who don't lower a gays and"
5284.500,5285.700," and it feels such a"
5286.300,5287.300," strong part of"
5288.100,5291.400," experiencing the world to open the eyes and suddenly"
5293.200,5295.300," it's it's quite a different kind of"
5296.400,5298.900," relationship going on and I just want"
5299.400,5302.000," I wondered almost whether there might be any"
5303.000,5303.600," other"
5304.000,5305.800," sort of tips to"
5306.500,5308.600," helping that particular part of"
5309.300,5311.300," experience sort of come into the"
5311.900,5312.100," same"
5312.800,5314.000," zone of"
5314.800,5315.400," absorption"
5315.700,5317.400," for example we particularly"
5318.100,5320.000," trying with eyes open might be"
5320.500,5324.100," the thing to do but I don't know if you have anything to say on that thank you"
5324.800,5329.800," yeah I would thank you thank you great to hear all about I would say"
5331.300,5332.200," that you've actually"
5333.000,5335.200," you've you've hit the nail on the head actually"
5335.700,5338.600," that one definite help if you"
5339.200,5340.700," with what you've just described it"
5341.300,5342.000," is definitely"
5342.600,5349.400," eyes open shift to eyes open notation that's I'd say that's probably the biggest advantage of eyes open meditation"
5350.000,5351.200," some others others might"
5351.800,5353.200," see other advantages as well but"
5353.800,5355.300," I think the most commonly"
5356.000,5356.700," discovered one"
5357.200,5360.200," is that it's just that much more similar"
5360.800,5362.400," to what we're doing the rest of the day"
5363.100,5363.900," and therefore"
5364.800,5368.400," it's that little bit easier not he's not going to find it"
5368.600,5370.100," massively easier by the way"
5370.500,5372.400," but you might find it just a bit easier"
5372.700,5374.100," to tap back into it"
5375.000,5379.200," at points through the day because you're used to the idea that the visual feel is"
5379.600,5381.100," part of what we're meditating with"
5381.900,5385.500," and and that's actually of course true also if eyes are open"
5386.100,5388.000," it's just a I mean sorry if I is a closed"
5388.300,5389.800," it's just that it's a much more muted"
5390.500,5390.900," and less"
5391.500,5394.800," engaging and eye-catching so to speak visual field"
5396.700,5407.900," and you know it's a really good point I mean I'd say it's you know it's great that you're getting into into deeper state when you're meditating you know of clarity of flow and you know and absorption"
5408.600,5408.800," and"
5410.200,5411.500," don't be too"
5413.200,5415.300," I don't know I'm a little I'm always a little bit too between like"
5416.100,5419.200," should we be trying to get that all the time you know and there's"
5420.000,5423.200," I think that the the trying to get is"
5425.000,5429.100," some and some traditions and some methodologies they would encourage that yeah and that"
5429.500,5431.000," see if that works for you just"
5431.700,5438.900," how can I remember to turn it on can I you can have a little mnemonics like every time you stand up every time you sit down just let there be a"
5439.200,5442.000," little tiny moment hey wait where's my awareness right now"
5442.400,5445.800," or every time you open a door every time you close the door let there be a little"
5446.200,5448.500," you know take that home would say when you're at a stoplight"
5449.100,5450.100," count three breaths"
5450.800,5453.200," and it's just and when the phone rings"
5453.900,5456.300," he said this in I remember reading this 30 years ago"
5456.900,5458.700," count three breaths before you pick it up and"
5459.200,5462.800," you know so there are little mnemonic devices that you can you can use"
5463.700,5465.800," but on the other hand there's"
5467.000,5468.900," there's an organic process as well"
5470.100,5472.700," where we're not really trying we're instead we're"
5473.300,5474.000," what we're doing"
5474.600,5479.100," in that is having a kind of patience having a kind of trust"
5480.000,5483.100," that you know we're part of a bigger process really"
5483.800,5485.500," and there's a ripening going on"
5486.200,5488.000," as long as we're doing our sitting daily"
5489.600,5490.700," we'll pretty much daily"
5491.200,5495.000," we're allowing a ripening process a maturing process to happen"
5495.900,5497.200," and just to sense that"
5497.800,5501.700," that might be true can also in itself bring"
5502.500,5506.100," a bit more piece that then brings a bit more awareness"
5507.000,5510.400," without having to really mechanically try to bring it on if you know what I mean"
5511.200,5514.400," so it's a it's a good it's a good place to be actually"
5515.100,5515.300," so"
5516.300,5518.200," tinker around and see what what you find"
5518.700,5524.800," yeah wonderful that and that's what it feels like is happening with this kind of support that"
5525.200,5526.400," you're helping if thank you"
5526.800,5531.000," well that's great thank you and I envy in Brazil well I don't know where you are in Brazil but"
5531.900,5532.700," that's the"
5533.500,5533.700," great"
5534.000,5535.000," hey Matthew hi"
5536.500,5538.300," actually it's so let me just say Luke are you"
5538.500,5540.000," if you're there at the moment Luke"
5540.400,5542.900," is there a way you create can you make um"
5543.600,5545.300," this you know like Matthew now can you"
5545.900,5549.200," can you get us both on the screens so I'm touch should be"
5550.200,5556.200," okay I wasn't seeing it that way but hey you go to go to speaker view Henry and you should be able to see both of you"
5556.800,5559.700," How good good good so what do I do multi-speaker"
5560.700,5562.400," and the other right go to view"
5563.300,5563.900," speaker and"
5564.200,5564.900," each other both of you"
5566.600,5566.800," okay"
5568.200,5568.400," okay"
5569.500,5574.600," now I can see you that's great but are you are you seeing everybody else or not do you just seeing the two of us"
5576.300,5579.100," it depends on how you select the view"
5579.700,5583.300," if you go gallery then you see everyone if you go speaker then you see"
5584.100,5584.700," whose"
5585.400,5586.200," whose who's"
5587.300,5588.300," pinned or spotlight"
5588.800,5591.700," okay okay okay okay okay thank you Matthew come on"
5592.100,5592.700," please on"
5593.000,5594.500," me um so thank you very much"
5595.600,5600.800," what you made me think today is I'll go to the simple question first and they say why I'm doing that or why this wasn't"
5601.600,5606.200," I'm trying to simplified what you're saying and basically my mind saying life is an illusion"
5606.800,5608.100," and on that one it's bringing up"
5608.600,5610.100," kind of what Sam Harris brought up recently"
5610.500,5612.600," and he brings up all the time which is neco cub"
5613.100,5614.500," yeah which I've recently painted"
5615.600,5618.300," that's a nice picture of a neck a cube I like that yeah"
5618.600,5622.400," and it's funny after a peanut I just stare at me my wife staring like"
5622.800,5625.100," huh I can't control it which way whoa"
5625.400,5629.300," and then my mind's going through okay everything life is delusion"
5629.600,5630.800," and then throwing on top of that"
5631.900,5636.900," as the same hair Springs I often is psychedelics and I've done it before and that brings up in"
5637.400,5643.200," well yeah everything is Delusion so is that what you're saying or is there a different way to proceed that and you said Joe"
5643.900,5645.400," recently either open so"
5646.000,5648.600," that's not required but maybe you get more of an illusion there"
5649.100,5657.300," I don't know that's my question okay okay great let's let's just unpack a bit actually by the way my book my new book has the NECA cube in it early on"
5657.800,5662.700," huh I had the book I didn't put it are you talking about it was there a picture of it I don't remember yeah there is there is"
5662.800,5664.500," a bad sort of a few pages in"
5664.800,5665.300," anyway um"
5666.000,5668.300," okay so we've got to be careful with language here"
5672.000,5678.100," I wanted to just let me just get to circulars in a moment okay yeah no problem I almost didn't want to bring that up because it seems yeah but"
5678.800,5680.800," yeah no I'd say look don't"
5681.900,5684.800," the way that we're perceiving this world"
5685.500,5686.600," is you know is is"
5687.300,5688.900," is a is a product of"
5689.500,5690.000," you know all these"
5691.000,5694.400," millennia of you know millions of years of evolutionary"
5695.500,5696.300," neurological"
5697.200,5697.700," development"
5698.300,5699.700," and we don't know"
5700.600,5701.000," what's"
5701.500,5705.500," really out there there's a great book by Donald Hoffman called the case against reality"
5706.600,5707.400," which is saying that we're"
5708.000,5708.500," we're actually"
5710.000,5711.800," evolution doesn't select"
5712.200,5714.400," but accuracy of perception"
5714.900,5717.200," it just selects for adaptation"
5717.800,5720.200," so we don't know that what we're seeing"
5720.900,5721.000," is"
5721.500,5721.800," any"
5722.500,5724.400," real representation of what's out there"
5725.100,5725.500," kind of thing"
5725.900,5729.700," and I mean that there's a very complex argument with lots of different views"
5730.100,5731.000," a nuances"
5731.300,5734.500," and some people would disagree with that in the cognitive Sciences and so on"
5734.800,5735.700," so it's not this is not"
5736.000,5737.300," any statement of how things are"
5738.200,5740.500," but I think it's wrong to think that"
5740.800,5741.000," you know"
5742.700,5745.300," with with seeing that that somehow"
5746.100,5746.100," to"
5747.000,5748.800," it's just an illusion"
5749.500,5750.300," or it's just"
5751.300,5752.800," some kind of distortion"
5754.200,5754.400," it's"
5754.700,5756.200," it is the way it is"
5757.400,5761.000," and it's only illusory in the sense that"
5762.100,5762.600," the more"
5763.500,5763.700," we"
5764.900,5767.700," that we okay let me put it like this that we can"
5768.800,5769.100," see"
5769.700,5770.000," that it's"
5771.800,5772.900," actually only"
5774.100,5775.100," an appearance"
5776.700,5779.800," it's not that it's a loser and really it looks like something else"
5781.200,5782.800," it's actually more like"
5783.600,5786.200," just a movie screen you know the movie"
5786.700,5788.500," is showing what the movie shows"
5789.000,5790.300," it's not distorted"
5791.200,5793.200," it's just that it's only a movie"
5794.400,5795.700," so this is more like that"
5796.600,5804.000," it's and actually this is a traditionally I mean it throughout the 20th century this analogy has been used by spiritual teachers that"
5805.300,5808.600," it's if you're watching a movie and the projector"
5809.200,5812.600," you turn around you can see that there's a projector and beams of light"
5813.000,5814.800," if you could do that with your life"
5815.600,5816.300," that's the great"
5816.800,5818.000," spiritual sort of"
5818.400,5819.400," accomplishment you know"
5820.100,5820.400," um"
5821.200,5821.600," and so"
5822.200,5826.000," so I just want to see you again as well you got anyway I can't see right now but"
5826.500,5829.200," I know you're in my screen somewhere but I can't see it"
5829.600,5829.800," um"
5830.700,5836.800," but that's not that's not what this is this this is more like that than that"
5837.300,5840.200," it's really presenting some other way and we've got to distortion of it"
5840.600,5840.800," now"
5842.000,5843.200," so it's it's about"
5843.900,5845.800," what is a rising"
5846.600,5848.400," it's not that it's um"
5849.200,5852.200," I think I've just made that point so now let me come to the psychedelic point"
5852.700,5854.000," the thing with psychedelics"
5855.500,5857.000," I mean I I'm not I'm not a"
5857.400,5861.500," I'm having used them very much and I had an Awakening experience before I"
5862.400,5865.900," ever did use one and when I did I found it to be way"
5867.300,5873.100," underwhelming because it was nowhere near as revelatory as what I'd seen in that moment of Awakening"
5873.800,5875.800," and but I know that some people do get"
5876.400,5879.300," um glimpses of this kind of thing the core"
5879.500,5880.700," point really is that you"
5881.700,5883.300," you see that yourself"
5884.300,5885.600," is only a construction"
5886.600,5887.600," it's only a"
5888.100,5889.000," self"
5889.400,5892.000," generated it's a self-generated self"
5892.800,5893.500," the self"
5894.800,5896.000," whipped itself up into"
5897.600,5897.800," some"
5898.400,5901.700," something and then believe that something and then the belief makes it"
5902.500,5903.000," seem more"
5904.000,5906.600," real than it actually is it's just the thoughts"
5907.600,5910.100," and it's just maybe subtle muscular contractions"
5910.800,5912.500," and that's all it is and"
5913.200,5914.400," it's illusory"
5915.900,5916.400," in that"
5917.100,5922.600," it's not the fixed solid little lump somehow there's in me that I think is me"
5925.700,5925.900," okay"
5926.700,5927.800," and so thank you yeah"
5928.200,5931.400," and so and then summary on psyched Henry's view"
5932.200,5933.600," which is a non"
5935.100,5937.100," psychedelic psychedelic lists"
5937.800,5938.700," view is that"
5939.300,5940.600," there's a lot of noise"
5941.400,5943.400," and then maybe some Signal at times"
5945.000,5949.800," you know and and I mean I did I have I have tried a handful of times I've had such a nice and"
5950.300,5953.300," I found them actually in particularly with iosco"
5954.800,5958.700," the first I've done it four times for ceremonies with iosca"
5958.900,5959.700," and the first one"
5960.200,5961.800," was absolutely brutal"
5962.600,5964.200," and very helpful"
5965.700,5967.200," and the other three when nothing really"
5969.100,5969.300," and"
5970.700,5971.800," I've also actually"
5972.400,5975.300," I also you know kept hearing about this thing DMT"
5976.200,5979.400," you know of five emo DMT you know there's a there's a lot of"
5979.900,5980.700," buzzed about that"
5981.100,5982.800," and I had some friends who were"
5983.600,5984.200," in a kind of"
5984.700,5986.700," they had a sort of ceremonial web using it"
5987.500,5994.300," and I thought well what the hell I'll try and it was just like a deep sit for me I just everything disappeared"
5995.100,5999.800," and there was a lot of love overwhelming sense of love and it was very familiar"
6000.900,6003.400," and so I was encouraged by that in the sense that"
6004.000,6004.900," I think"
6006.000,6009.200," it it could be helpful for people to"
6009.500,6010.200," to experience that"
6010.900,6011.100," but"
6012.000,6013.000," there's always this"
6013.900,6014.700," problem I think"
6015.400,6016.900," or there could be which is that"
6017.500,6019.600," you know you've taken an intoxicant"
6020.900,6021.700," you know you have"
6022.200,6022.400," and"
6023.100,6029.700," and I'm I'm sure again I'm not a I'm not a I don't know enough about this but I could just giving you my own personal view that"
6030.300,6035.000," it's different when you realize this stuff about your own"
6035.500,6036.200," ordinary"
6036.600,6036.900," consciousness"
6038.300,6041.500," and that's why zen is always saying ordinary mind is the way"
6042.200,6044.100," your ordinary experience"
6044.800,6047.700," is actually all ready all this stuff I've been talking about"
6049.200,6052.900," you don't and and you know so anyway take take that as as"
6053.500,6054.700," as you may and"
6055.700,6056.200," yeah okay"
6056.700,6058.700," what one but comment on your movie thing is"
6059.000,6062.200," I we're recently as you look closer we'll viewing"
6062.700,6065.600," as you get culture and closer you seeing world made a pixels here"
6066.500,6069.000," exactly what you're saying so what yep that's exactly"
6069.500,6072.800," so yes TV you get closer ah that's all you're here"
6073.100,6073.500," so that's it"
6074.000,6077.100," that's that's something to that as well thank you thank you very much"
6077.700,6078.900," okay Elizabeth hi"
6079.400,6080.000," please unmute"
6083.300,6086.300," all right thank you thank you so much and good morning"
6087.400,6088.900," I'm very grateful to be here"
6089.500,6092.400," and I wondered if you could speak a little bit"
6093.300,6096.400," pointedly to one of the paradoxes"
6096.800,6097.500," and it's been"
6098.000,6099.800," part of this morning's talk and and"
6100.200,6100.900," and a Rises"
6102.000,6107.100," frequently that maybe I would be grateful for any clearly that you might be able to bring"
6107.800,6108.200," which is"
6111.200,6114.300," the idea and these is coming from Awakening"
6115.900,6117.800," literature and stories of Awakening"
6118.500,6119.000," there's the"
6121.100,6123.200," often repeated idea that"
6124.300,6126.800," everything kind of dissolves into"
6128.200,6131.200," into emptiness or nothingness vastness"
6131.800,6132.400," the void"
6134.600,6134.800," but"
6135.500,6137.800," you get a you know the thing that makes"
6138.900,6140.700," people weep and kind of destroys"
6141.300,6141.900," in a sense"
6143.800,6151.500," composure isn't isn't just this aw or at this grander of emptiness and the dissolving maybe of the ego structures"
6151.800,6152.600," although that's huge"
6153.100,6157.500," but it's more the alnus of the love the love and the"
6158.100,6158.400," and the"
6159.000,6160.600," and it's all there it's so"
6161.300,6163.800," could you maybe address the"
6164.200,6165.800," the dichotomy there and the"
6166.500,6167.500," seeming Paradox"
6168.300,6176.800," yeah I I'll tell you how I take you okay and because it's a very good point I mean you would wonder why is it such a marvelous experience"
6177.900,6178.100," to"
6179.100,6181.600," to sort of basically have all experienced vanish"
6182.500,6186.500," why did yamada Cohen say you know this hurricane of delight"
6187.100,6190.600," weld up when heaven and earth collapsed and were reduced to dust"
6191.200,6191.900," you'd think it would be"
6192.500,6193.500," awful you know"
6195.100,6195.200," and"
6195.800,6197.500," I don't I'm gonna Hazard"
6198.000,6199.800," a couple of different answers I mean one"
6200.300,6202.900," one thing that I think is true is that"
6203.400,6206.400," first of all there is an Unbelievable sense of relief"
6207.700,6210.100," that so much as being carried"
6210.700,6213.100," so much energy has gone into holding"
6213.700,6216.200," this world together as I as I"
6216.700,6220.400," normally do in Holy myself together and response to the world that"
6220.700,6222.300," I think I'm constantly facing"
6222.800,6226.100," that it's just an Unbelievable relief when the whole thing"
6227.000,6227.600," collapses"
6228.600,6230.200," and so that's one thing another thing"
6230.800,6231.700," is um"
6232.300,6233.300," that actually"
6235.000,6235.300," that"
6236.100,6237.600," that this is where of course"
6238.000,6241.800," it's a truism and it's almost boring to say it but yeah language"
6242.400,6244.400," can't really handle this stuff"
6245.200,6246.700," language is a construct"
6247.400,6251.700," marvelous elaborate construct of millions many many contracts"
6252.100,6252.900," linguistic ones"
6253.600,6254.300," that attempt to"
6255.700,6257.300," refer to the World as We Do"
6258.100,6259.700," now navigate it and understand it"
6260.100,6261.900," on not on this level and"
6262.600,6265.600," this is so granted language can't do it because"
6266.000,6266.300," this"
6267.100,6268.500," term emptiness"
6269.100,6270.400," is really misleading"
6271.700,6273.200," you know it's it's um"
6274.900,6276.800," it's in some ways it's it's"
6277.200,6278.800," it's alright perhaps you know"
6279.600,6280.700," but what that"
6282.100,6283.600," gone nests"
6283.800,6284.200," is"
6285.200,6285.500," is"
6286.200,6286.900," absolutely"
6288.000,6288.900," everything is"
6290.300,6291.500," so it's a meeting"
6292.200,6294.100," of all things together"
6294.900,6295.500," as one"
6297.100,6298.300," it's actually not"
6302.400,6302.800," it's not"
6304.000,6304.600," it's not"
6306.500,6310.100," this I can't use language I was going to say it's not"
6310.300,6311.000," empty"
6311.200,6312.000," it's full"
6313.000,6315.100," it's not gone it's all"
6316.400,6318.100," it is all and is gone"
6319.000,6319.500," it is"
6319.900,6323.300," full and is empty it's not so the the the"
6323.900,6327.800," to get an idea of it based on the language will always be"
6329.000,6329.400," probably"
6330.500,6331.000," problematic"
6331.600,6333.100," it won't really represent it"
6334.400,6335.600," might one of my teachers"
6336.900,6338.300," real and roshi"
6338.800,6340.300," he his he's a he's"
6341.900,6344.400," fairly fluent in English and his coinage was"
6345.500,6346.500," not oneness"
6347.500,6350.500," but that's something people commonly experience actually by the way as a sort of"
6351.100,6352.700," more commonly probably than"
6353.900,6354.700," quite a good emptiness"
6355.500,6362.400," gone oneness and he added the G I think it's him he he added g to make gone this"
6363.700,6365.500," so sometimes we'll experience oneness"
6366.300,6367.400," sometimes will experience"
6367.800,6368.400," gone"
6368.700,6368.900," this"
6370.000,6372.000," which also contains one this"
6376.600,6376.800," okay"
6377.500,6379.700," thank you thank you Elizabeth thank you so much"
6380.600,6382.400," surely sure sure okay"
6383.300,6383.600," um"
6384.900,6386.200," let me go back to gallery"
6386.800,6387.700," yeah Kim hi"
6389.400,6390.100," hi can you hear me"
6390.700,6390.900," yes"
6391.500,6391.600," great"
6393.100,6401.400," thank you so much for everything this the way for me has been profound and I wanted to share an experience with you I'm on the Cohan"
6402.100,6402.500," section"
6403.300,6407.000," and the experience I had was this too is me"
6408.000,6413.400," and I was working with that and I was on my way to get a cup of coffee at the local coffee shop"
6414.500,6416.600," and I passed a man"
6418.400,6422.000," with a dark beard and kind of a middle-aged guy and"
6423.800,6425.600," I just looked at him and said"
6426.100,6426.700," to myself"
6427.400,6429.000," this to is me"
6430.900,6433.400," and I Began to cry"
6434.800,6438.300," and then I looked down at the sidewalk that I was walking on"
6439.800,6441.800," and I said this to is me"
6443.400,6443.600," and I"
6444.100,6451.100," tried more and it was just and then everything I looked at I was just saying this too is me this too is me"
6452.200,6455.100," and it was so profound Henry it was just"
6456.700,6460.400," it took me by surprise it took me a little while to"
6461.000,6462.000," re-gather myself"
6462.900,6469.400," and I have never worked with coan's I've been practicing for many years but never worked with coins and so"
6470.000,6473.200," I wanted to thank you and just any thoughts you have or"
6474.100,6475.900," it was important that I share that with"
6476.400,6477.100," somebody who could"
6478.000,6478.500," speak to it"
6479.700,6484.000," well that's wonderful that's wonderful came out I would just you know you"
6484.600,6491.000," all your own innate Wisdom will come forth and and and give you what you need I just want to affirm that I"
6492.000,6495.400," I fully agree yeah okay"
6496.000,6503.800," that's lovely lovely lovely thank you so much for sharing that and just you know don't don't cling to it just carry on with your"
6504.200,6506.000," practice you know yeah no thank you so much"
6506.600,6512.000," yeah let it just let it be in your heart you know and do what it needs to do from your heart what it"
6512.400,6514.200," whatever there is in your heart around that"
6514.800,6519.200," just that it do what it what it does it you know just"
6519.900,6521.700," don't impede and don't induce"
6522.300,6523.100," yeah okay"
6524.000,6525.300," thank you okay"
6526.600,6527.400," thank you for sharing that"
6527.700,6531.400," okay let's see we could we just got time for one more"
6532.400,6534.300," gosia with you like to unmute"
6535.200,6537.400," tell me tell me how to pronounce your name as well if I got it wrong"
6546.700,6547.800," I'm a little bit nervous"
6548.100,6551.600," so I hope you can forgive me if I stumble a little"
6552.200,6559.600," I'm a beginner I've been practicing for a little over a year first on my own and then with a princess sangha here in Poland"
6560.300,6562.700," and the practice they recommend for beginners is"
6563.100,6566.000," Brett Kelvin so this is what I've been doing mostly"
6566.500,6568.000," but I'm also using the way up"
6568.300,6568.500," and"
6569.200,6573.300," I am on a field of outer senses right now"
6573.800,6576.500," and this got me thinking if maybe I should"
6577.200,6579.000," kind of combined that you approaches"
6579.500,6584.000," to make my practice more effective and I will give some examples to illustrate what I mean"
6584.400,6591.400," but first I want to say thank you for this amazing program it's been a very powerful experience for me so far"
6592.500,6592.800," and"
6593.600,6593.700," so"
6594.200,6594.900," examples"
6596.000,6596.400," and"
6597.200,6600.700," how to combine focusing on the census and the breath"
6601.200,6601.900," should I"
6602.800,6604.000," try to be aware"
6605.400,6605.600," of"
6606.400,6608.700," what ever is going on on the visual plane"
6609.900,6612.300," what ever is going on on the auditory"
6612.700,6615.600," plane and whatever going whatever is going on"
6615.900,6617.200," in my physical body"
6617.900,6619.300," all at the same time"
6620.100,6622.200," while also breeding and counting"
6622.800,6623.700," so should I"
6624.500,6626.900," kind of treat what ever is going on"
6627.500,6627.800," as"
6628.400,6630.900," if it was happening on a single plane"
6631.500,6635.300," so this is approach number one or maybe I showed"
6635.900,6641.700," for example there is like a sound that I'm hearing so my attention is pulled to the sound"
6642.300,6643.100," and then there is"
6643.800,6645.800," maybe a sensation in my body so"
6646.400,6649.500," my attention is pulled towards that Sensation"
6650.200,6653.200," and at the same time I'm Still Breathing and counting"
6653.900,6654.500," or maybe"
6655.300,6656.400," approach number three"
6657.200,6661.000," I should just focus on breathing and counting and forget about"
6662.100,6662.700," everything else"
6664.800,6670.700,"yeah okay well I I think um if you have if you're having in-person guidance"
6671.100,6672.200," in your home town"
6673.100,6673.700," that should be"
6675.500,6677.300," maybe that should be Primary"
6677.700,6682.200," and here's one there's that there's another option that you didn't list actually"
6682.700,6685.600," which is what I would probably think might be most helpful"
6686.300,6688.100," you do your breath counting"
6688.900,6690.900," and whenever you're not on the breath"
6691.800,6696.200," you you notice where you've been in my have been in thought for example"
6697.400,6698.800," and then you come back to"
6700.400,6701.600," physical Sensation"
6702.400,6705.000," auditory Sensation visual Sensation"
6706.800,6707.900," get present again"
6709.200,6710.700," and then resume the breath counting"
6712.100,6720.800," okay that's that would be one way to do it now with your very first one you said was being aware of all three at once if you're able to do that"
6721.600,6723.800," that's tremendous there is a practice where"
6724.300,6725.700," we're just aware of all"
6726.600,6729.200," outer experience that's to say body"
6730.200,6730.700," visual"
6732.200,6732.900," auditory"
6733.300,6736.000," and part of the body is the breath coming and going"
6736.900,6737.200,"and"
6737.800,6739.300," there is a practice where"
6739.500,6741.900," we're actually able to hold all three"
6743.000,6744.500," as basically just one"
6745.500,6746.500," kind of portal"
6746.800,6748.200," of outward experienced"
6749.500,6752.500," and so if you're able to do that that's kind of best of all"
6753.400,6753.600," but"
6754.000,6755.800," typically otherwise I would say"
6756.300,6759.600," I was very it's rather difficult to really get into breath counting"
6760.200,6761.700," if you're also tracking"
6762.800,6765.700," the other senses for most people that's quite difficult"
6766.900,6768.700," and so it would be better probably to just"
6769.300,6772.600," in less you can experience all of that outer experiences one"
6773.100,6774.700," which it is possible to do but"
6775.200,6775.700," if that's not"
6776.200,6777.100," easy for you then"
6777.800,6778.400," follow the breath"
6779.400,6780.600," and when you're off it"
6780.900,6782.200," notice where you've been"
6782.700,6784.200," come back to presence"
6786.300,6787.200," that means"
6787.600,6788.300," see here feel"
6788.800,6789.500," you know out"
6790.000,6791.700," and then come back to picking up the breath"
6793.100,6793.600," okay no"
6794.200,6795.400," what I know this is that I"
6797.700,6798.100," there's a"
6798.600,6798.700," part right"
6799.500,6801.000," counting so I'm not losing"
6801.600,6801.700," you know"
6802.900,6803.800," I'm not getting"
6804.800,6805.700," I can still count"
6806.600,6806.900," yeah but"
6807.100,6817.400," there is another part of my brain that is wandering for example so if I'm trying to focus on all three at once which is very very difficult for me at this stage"
6817.800,6818.700," I'm not losing"
6819.300,6819.500," you know"
6820.300,6822.400," I'm still presently because it's so difficult"
6823.200,6826.500," and I am wondering what I should strive towards"
6827.100,6832.200," so yeah no I think do that fourth thing that I suggested stay with counts"
6832.300,6833.700," to give all give it all to the breath"
6834.700,6835.400," but when you're off"
6835.600,6836.700," when you recognize your off"
6837.000,6838.200," come back to being present"
6838.700,6840.200," before you pick up the breath again"
6841.600,6841.800," okay"
6842.700,6842.900," thank you"
6844.000,6846.900," great now we're on the hours so I'm sorry uh"
6847.500,6849.500," Jen and Francisco will have to do next week"
6850.200,6851.700," but that not the next time we meet"
6852.200,6853.000," um thank you for"
