196.400,197.400," asking it over to Henry"
203.500,205.800," right beautiful beautiful huh hello everybody"
208.000,209.800," great to be with you for another"
210.600,212.100," original love Sunday"
213.000,213.800," and they"
214.900,218.000," an expiration you know of of our human"
219.600,221.700," of our human experience what it is"
222.200,222.600," to be"
223.600,224.200," embodied"
225.400,226.000," human body"
227.000,227.100," human"
227.800,228.300," heart"
229.300,229.700," human"
230.200,230.700," mind"
232.200,233.900," human awareness human consciousness"
235.700,236.700," in this"
237.800,238.100," very"
238.700,239.000," world"
240.600,241.300," just not"
241.900,242.200," forgetting"
243.700,244.200," that we"
244.900,246.600," do not that we that we"
247.100,250.100," exist in entirely dependently"
251.300,251.900," you know as"
252.800,253.000," some"
254.000,255.100," teachers are commentators"
255.600,255.800," say"
256.500,257.200," you know are"
257.900,261.500," well actually particularly I'm thinking of Stephen Jenkinson right now he said"
264.100,268.600," by the way some of you if you don't know him he's he did a great movie called grief Walker"
269.600,271.500," greif Walker it's a documentary"
272.300,273.000," about his work"
273.600,273.700," with"
274.600,275.000," the dying"
276.900,279.000," us actually in effect we are"
280.300,283.100," we are The Dying that we may not like to remember it but we are"
283.900,285.000," and anyway Stephen"
285.600,288.500," Jenkinson says life you know our life is not"
289.500,289.900," actually"
290.600,292.500," a gift it's a loan"
293.700,294.600," we are alone"
296.100,296.600," the stuff"
297.100,298.500," that makes this body"
299.300,300.400," this experience"
301.700,306.100," and when the time is up the loan will be recalled"
307.400,310.400," so he actually encourages us to remember that"
311.200,311.400," you know"
312.200,312.600," what"
313.800,315.000," gives us our life"
315.800,316.000," it's"
316.500,319.400," kind of come from someone he says it's like it's left a hole"
320.800,324.000," it's left a hole what is being given to make us"
324.700,326.600," as left a hole in the Fabric of this"
327.200,327.800," great Earth"
328.700,332.900," and that whole will be refilled you know it will be paid back"
334.400,334.800," so our"
335.400,336.100," just the more"
337.300,338.700," we recognise our"
340.600,342.200," total dependency actually"
342.700,343.600," it's very"
344.600,347.500," it's a beautiful heart softening heart opening"
348.000,348.400," thing"
349.300,350.300," to recognise that anyway"
350.800,351.800," we will be exploring"
352.700,355.800," you know how how are we related to this planet"
356.600,359.700," and how might we become more aware of"
360.600,365.600," it and there's different levels you know there's somebody who know me from this from this"
365.900,368.800," both from this original love programme from the original of book"
369.100,370.300," from the way app"
370.700,373.300," however you've come to this very morning Right Here and Now"
373.900,377.200," you'll know that I believe in their not only being"
377.900,379.000," one level of"
379.700,380.500," true practice"
381.400,385.400," there's whatever level so to speak we're on is the true level"
386.100,387.100," you know whether it's about"
387.700,387.900," just"
388.500,391.500," finding our way to settling into mindfulness whether it's about"
392.200,393.100," discovering a"
393.700,396.600," mind-blowing cosmic unity with the whole universe"
397.100,397.800," buying two"
398.400,399.500," but actually they're both"
401.000,403.100," equally relevant equally valuable"
404.100,405.100," and equally"
407.000,407.600," parts"
407.900,408.700," that helped"
409.100,409.500," us"
411.000,411.200," with"
412.400,413.200," the basic problem"
414.300,414.400," that"
416.100,419.300," has generated all these different forms of practice which is"
420.900,423.100," I mean in a nutshell it's human suffering"
423.900,426.900," but understood both as the fact that we suffer"
427.500,429.600," and as that we cause suffering"
430.700,431.300," so it's really"
432.200,432.700," how do we"
435.500,436.800," I mean you know the the first"
437.400,438.600," point of Buddhism that"
439.300,440.700," Foundation of Buddhism"
442.000,444.000," is is the statement there"
444.500,444.800," is"
445.500,445.900," suffering"
447.400,448.600," that's the first noble truth"
449.800,449.900," and"
453.200,454.200," that's all ways"
454.700,455.500," you know are"
456.400,457.400," beginning place"
457.700,458.600," that we suffer"
460.100,461.500," others we love suffer"
462.800,463.700," this world"
464.800,467.200," is by some reckonings"
468.900,470.800," all Waze on fire"
471.300,473.000," always a process of"
474.100,476.800," arising and disappearing"
478.300,479.200," and it's also"
479.900,482.300," you know these days as we know where"
482.900,485.200," in what some called a Polly crisis"
486.600,486.700," so"
488.200,490.700," it may be even more so sort of ramped up"
491.100,491.200," the"
493.100,494.400," the Flames in which we're living"
496.700,497.100," and so"
498.000,498.700," practice"
499.000,499.700," begins"
500.000,500.200," with"
500.600,500.900," that"
502.000,504.100," and as we're we're going through our three"
504.800,506.300," sessions in the process of this"
507.200,508.500," of this mini course"
509.700,510.400," will be"
511.800,512.600," will be looking at"
513.300,516.400," how understanding and practicing with"
517.200,518.600," sort of different levels of our"
519.300,520.600," relationship with this earth"
521.900,522.200," can"
522.900,523.500," help us"
523.800,524.000," to"
525.000,525.400," you know b"
527.400,528.300," essentially"
529.600,530.300," wiser"
530.700,530.800," and"
531.500,532.100," kinda"
533.500,534.500," which are really the two-"
535.800,537.600," wings of practice wisdom"
538.900,539.500," and compassion"
540.400,541.900," the two wings of Buddhism"
543.400,544.000," wisdom"
544.500,545.100," and compassion"
545.900,549.900," understanding both again on different levels there will be exploring"
550.600,551.700," okay so that's like a rough"
552.500,553.100," intro to"
554.300,557.900," what we're going to be doing and I want to start with a sit"
558.700,558.900," and"
560.800,562.900," for those of you who have come from the way"
563.500,565.300," and haven't joined one of these sessions before"
566.100,568.000," we typically do a 30 minute sit"
568.700,572.500," we'll thereabouts when we start this Sunday sessions so it's a chance"
573.300,576.400," for some of you it'll be a chance to go you know a bit deeper"
576.800,577.400," than you might normally"
578.000,580.100," be doing if you're normally doing shorter sets"
580.900,582.600," and so just you know let yourself"
583.600,586.000," if Let It Be what it is don't have"
587.500,587.800," some"
588.700,591.400," fixed idea about what needs to happen or"
592.200,593.200," you know because sometimes going"
594.200,596.400," longer and deeper means"
597.200,599.400," you know we might hit rougher to rain"
599.600,600.900," it's not all about"
601.800,605.700," deeper equal smoother you know it's we we don't know what we're going to find"
606.300,608.000," every sit is is"
611.200,612.400," just like every moment"
613.400,615.300," is actually in if we if we"
616.600,617.400," if we train"
617.900,621.000," enough and long enough we might start to really find this that"
621.700,622.700," you know every sit"
623.500,624.000," every moment"
624.800,625.600," is our first"
626.600,626.900," sit"
628.300,629.500," our first ever"
630.400,630.600," sit"
631.900,633.500," that's what beginner's mind"
634.600,636.700," is really referring to every moment"
637.600,638.400," is our first"
639.000,639.500," moment"
641.200,644.300," and you might just see what is that feel like in your body to hear that"
645.500,646.000," might be"
646.700,647.400," exciting"
648.400,650.800," my appear to sense of anticipation it might"
650.900,651.600," hold a promise"
652.200,653.400," or in there might be some little"
654.300,656.900," discomfort I can't do that or you know"
657.600,659.400," I'm not experiencing that or something you know"
660.000,661.600," and whatever it is we welcome"
662.500,662.700," it this"
663.800,664.500," the fundamental of"
665.400,666.300," practice in this"
666.900,667.300," programme"
668.200,670.200," is learning more and more"
671.100,672.000," to allow"
673.300,673.800," welcome"
675.000,675.700," embrace"
676.800,677.800," whatever we find"
678.400,678.600," in"
679.300,680.000," our practice"
680.700,682.800," and you know by extension actually"
683.500,684.400," whatever we're finding"
685.200,685.900," in life"
687.300,689.800," and again that's starting point is the"
690.500,691.400," allowing of it"
693.100,694.700," and it's from that that we can"
695.700,697.200," actually learn to respond"
698.900,699.600," more helpfully"
701.100,702.600," not for a place of resisting"
703.800,705.100," but from allowing"
706.900,707.600," okay so"
708.700,709.200," let's"
710.600,712.600," find a comfortable seated position"
723.300,724.100," so we yeah we"
724.400,727.400," comfort is is the operative word here we"
728.100,730.100," we don't need to be"
731.100,732.700," sort of stressing out with some"
733.400,736.700," ideal of posture not at all but ideal"
737.400,738.100," is the one"
738.800,739.500," where we're"
740.300,741.200," we're most comfortable"
742.100,742.500," actually"
744.700,746.300," and that you're able to find"
748.800,750.700," a sense of comfort in your own body"
760.100,760.700," if you're"
761.100,764.100," dealing with any kinds of body pain"
765.100,766.900," and work around them try to"
767.600,769.500," make it as easy as you can for those"
770.400,771.100," parts of the body"
778.000,778.500," you know I'm going to"
779.000,781.100," give some guidance assuming that you're"
782.200,785.700," your upright but if you're not if you're reclining"
786.200,787.200," that's just great"
787.700,788.600," just adapt"
789.500,792.500," you know when I'm saying and take what's relevant for you"
800.300,801.400," let's begin by"
802.700,803.400," arriving here"
811.200,814.100," you know although we're all over the world in a certain way"
814.900,815.400," here"
816.200,817.100," Right Here"
818.000,820.200," is actually kind of the same for all of us"
821.700,823.200," wherever we are it's alright"
824.400,824.700," here"
832.600,832.900," we can"
833.400,835.400," we can start to pause it out a little bit"
837.300,837.700," feeling"
838.100,838.700," your seat"
842.100,843.700," can you relax into"
844.300,844.900," the seat"
849.100,850.300," that the hips are relaxed"
853.600,854.800," and the barely relax"
858.400,863.700," it's almost like we're kind of"
865.000,867.300," balling down into the center of the body"
871.400,872.700," that chest relax"
875.400,876.300," their shoulders"
876.900,877.800," at relax"
880.200,881.100," that shoulders"

890.900,891.600," relax let them go"
904.700,907.000," now let's release the JW"
909.500,911.400," let it sink a millimetre or two"
916.400,919.700," you might feel some sensation in the throat as you do that"
933.500,936.400," let the back of your neck extend very slightly"
938.400,941.300," it says if the top of the back of the skull"
942.900,945.900," is being very lightly drawn upwards"
947.400,948.600," away from the body"
949.900,952.000," maybe just half a millimetre"
952.200,953.800," tiny amount but it's enough"
956.600,958.400," to have a little sense of"
960.000,960.500," opening"
961.000,962.100," in the back of the neck"
968.900,969.600," that"
971.100,972.500," kind of go with"
974.200,976.000," the slackening of the jaw"
989.000,990.700," we're bringing some he's"
993.000,994.700," into the whole area"
996.400,997.800," this critical area"
998.100,1000.400," of the central nervous system where"
1002.100,1002.200," the"
1004.100,1005.300," spinal column"
1007.100,1009.000," and all the millions of nerves in it"
1010.000,1010.700," meet"
1012.400,1012.700," the"
1013.500,1014.400," the brainstem"
1014.700,1015.800," the base of the brain"

1019.900,1020.600," and skull"
1022.000,1022.700," into sect"
1026.600,1028.200," so all around that area"
1028.600,1029.900," of the base of the skull"
1032.600,1034.000," we're bringing an ease"
1038.900,1042.300," as if that joint that joining that Junction"
1043.800,1044.600," of skull"
1045.500,1046.000," connect"
1047.200,1049.200," as floating on a kind of bed"
1050.600,1052.300," of hydraulic oil"
1055.400,1056.900," very smooth and easy"
1068.300,1069.300," but face relaxed"
1076.600,1077.600," eyes are"
1078.100,1082.800," a closed for many of you and there might be open for some with the gaze"
1083.700,1084.200," lower"
1085.400,1086.100," either way"
1089.100,1090.300," let your eyeballs"
1091.300,1092.000," be soft"
1101.200,1102.900," that the rest in there"
1103.600,1105.000," twin caves"
1118.000,1119.100," is a balance"
1124.900,1126.000," in equilibrium"
1133.800,1135.600," shoulders again arresting"
1137.100,1138.400," and they too are balanced"
1145.900,1146.900," so I'll throw it"
1149.100,1150.000," soft belly"
1157.000,1157.400," soft"
1158.400,1158.900," hips"
1164.100,1168.300," and a spreading softness through the upper legs"
1172.500,1174.100," and the lower legs"

1237.200,1240.500," the great Zen master tiknet Hahn had some"
1241.500,1242.500," meditations"
1245.100,1246.500," in which he'd brought in"
1247.700,1251.600," elements of the Natural World and we're going to touch in on some now"
1253.600,1254.900," sitting still"
1256.700,1257.600," as a mountain"
1291.800,1293.500," still as a mountain"
1340.800,1341.500," sitting"
1342.200,1343.900," mountain still"
1401.600,1403.200," mountain still"
1434.400,1437.400," is there a way our sitting can be clear"
1438.300,1439.100," as water"
1444.500,1447.300," clear as fresh spring water"
1509.800,1511.100," melting still"
1512.100,1512.600," clear"
1513.100,1513.800," as water"
1603.200,1603.900," and"
1605.300,1607.000,"be open as the sky"
1618.900,1621.300," is there a way meditation right now"
1623.400,1624.500," is open"
1624.800,1625.600," as the sky"
1676.700,1677.900," The Only Was a mountain"
1680.300,1681.500," clear as water"
1683.600,1684.100," open"
1685.200,1686.000," as the sky"
1701.600,1703.500," and notice the sky"
1705.200,1708.700," in it's great openness doesn't reject anything"
1711.600,1714.900," but whatever may arise you know thoughts feelings"
1716.400,1717.100," are the kinds of"
1717.900,1720.300," Sensation or experience as we sit"
1721.600,1723.800," the great openness of the sky"
1726.000,1727.000," can welcome it"
1729.500,1731.300," to just to hold it"
1732.200,1733.100," receive it"
1734.800,1735.900," allow it"
1776.600,1779.600," notice if there's any impulse to"
1780.100,1781.500," change something or"
1782.200,1783.200," resist something"
1786.000,1787.400," let that also"
1788.600,1789.000," be"
1790.200,1791.100," a 100%"
1791.500,1792.600," allowed"
1794.600,1796.600," the great open Sky"
1797.800,1799.000," and allows it"
1824.500,1826.800," some say oh true heart"
1827.700,1828.100," is"
1829.600,1830.900," as open as the"
1883.900,1886.000," sky and are sitting be like a river"
1887.300,1889.100," a constant flow"
1890.200,1891.100," of experience"
1892.300,1894.200," but nothing impedes"
1895.500,1897.500," or hinders or tries to"
1898.200,1899.800," resist or hold back"
1901.400,1902.000," sitting"
1903.400,1905.800," let's the river of experience"
1907.300,1907.800," flow"
1909.500,1910.600," flow freely"
1912.300,1913.000," like a river"
1995.300,1996.400," and what if"
1997.600,2000.300," some level are true heart mind"
2002.100,2003.700," is as wide as the world"
2006.900,2008.800," as wide as the great Earth"
2021.100,2024.100," is there some way that our sitting can be"
2024.900,2026.200," open as the sky"
2027.600,2028.700," and wide"
2029.400,2030.500," as the great Earth"
2045.800,2048.000," and you know with these phrases if"
2048.900,2050.600," if they resonate great"
2051.500,2052.800," and if they don't particularly"
2053.600,2054.800," that's just fine"
2055.900,2058.100," let them kind of wash through you"
2059.600,2060.400," you don't have to"
2061.500,2062.600," make anything happen"
2066.900,2067.900," it's all about"
2068.500,2069.200," allowing"
2070.300,2071.500," allowing what it is"
2074.100,2075.000," the best we can"
2075.400,2075.800," right now"
2079.200,2080.700," sometimes that's hard and"
2082.200,2083.300," then we allow that"
2093.500,2093.800," sitting"
2095.400,2096.100," as wide"
2097.200,2098.200," as the great Earth"
2123.400,2126.300," then again not trying to make something happen"
2196.200,2196.800," sitting"
2198.100,2198.600," right"
2199.500,2200.600," as a star"
2272.200,2273.300," star I mean to rest"
2282.600,2286.500," I need to rest as the Dew Falls"
2288.200,2289.000," and rest"
2291.100,2291.600," on the"
2291.900,2293.200," grasses and leaves"
2295.200,2296.000," in the early morning"
2307.800,2309.000," finding rest"
2322.800,2324.700," having rest emerge"
2327.200,2328.300," from our stillness"
2335.600,2337.400," from this time of quiet"
2341.200,2343.000," the way to you emerges"
2343.900,2344.600," from the night"
2359.700,2362.500," sitting itself as a deeply natural"
2363.800,2364.400," process"
2390.700,2392.700," slowly kind of filling up"
2393.200,2394.200," with rest"
2399.500,2400.500," getting a bit more"
2401.700,2404.000," damn for wet or soaked"
2406.200,2407.600," in restfulness"
2410.600,2412.000," and the clarity"
2413.100,2413.900," of you"
2445.900,2446.900," resting"
2447.100,2447.700," in"

2622.800,2625.700," going back we do not know how far"
2627.000,2629.400," but probably into the paleolithic"
2632.200,2634.900," maybe back to the early paleolith"
2637.100,2638.400," maybe back in to"
2639.800,2642.700," a recipients times who knows"
2647.000,2648.300," and humans found"
2650.200,2651.700," this inner capacity"
2654.100,2655.400," to release the whole"
2658.100,2658.900," to let go"
2662.000,2662.800," to discover"
2664.300,2664.800," a level"
2665.500,2666.200," of being"
2667.800,2670.000," in which they were not separate"
2676.800,2677.700," but is still here"
2679.100,2679.600," for us"
2681.600,2682.100," right now"

3050.400,3051.800," let me just I want to just say"
3052.100,3053.200," a couple of words about"
3055.900,3057.700," the uh this this little"
3058.000,3060.600," mini programme of three Sundays that the"
3061.500,3064.000," that we have mountains rivers and the great Earth"
3064.900,3065.100," the"
3067.500,3069.500," it's a common phenomenon I think that"
3071.400,3072.300," many of us will"
3072.700,3072.900," have"
3073.800,3075.900," found throughout our lives that when we"
3076.900,3077.700," get into nature"
3079.200,3080.200," whether it's a park"
3081.400,3083.200," or just a tree at the end of the garden"

3086.200,3087.900," walking across a lawn"

3097.600,3098.700," do its own thing"
3100.000,3102.200," you know we're we will get very often"
3103.200,3105.200," even subtly some kind of shift"
3106.500,3106.900," in our"
3107.400,3108.300," sense of things"
3110.000,3110.800," whereby"
3112.900,3113.400," somehow"
3115.000,3117.100," we might get just a little space"
3118.400,3119.900," between our normal"
3120.800,3123.000," habitual chatter and commentary"
3123.700,3126.500," are all habitual sense of being plugged into"
3127.500,3127.800," you know"
3128.700,3129.700," a life of"
3131.000,3133.000," work projects responsibilities"
3133.900,3135.400," ambitions hopes"
3136.900,3138.900," and of course many relationships with"

3296.500,3297.900," and the pool is so dark"

3403.900,3407.400," it rounds and rounds despair to drowning"
3410.400,3410.800," how"

3415.500,3416.600," in the Slade"
3420.100,3422.800," Hopkins was a remarkable man he was a Jesuit"

3425.400,3425.900," and he never"
3426.600,3429.200," he basically never published a poem in his lifetime"
3429.800,3431.100," he just had a few friends"
3432.200,3435.100," who liked his poetry who had share them"
3435.500,3436.300," it's share them with"
3438.100,3440.400," and there's it's just an absolute treasure of"
3441.300,3442.600," remarkable"
3444.100,3445.700," as you can tell very sort of dense"
3447.600,3452.000," sonically dents and images in an image imagery based dense poetry"
3452.700,3453.900," terribly beautiful and"
3454.700,3457.000," these are poems that it really repays"
3457.900,3461.600," so the memorizing and getting to know over a lifetime because they won't"
3462.200,3464.000," they won't yield all their treasures"
3464.800,3465.600," right off the bat"

3467.200,3468.100," some sense of"

3474.700,3475.800," to the Natural World"
3476.100,3477.100," and how"
3477.500,3480.200," when we be take ourselves"

3483.200,3483.700," two"
3484.800,3487.400," the non-human the more than human world"
3490.500,3492.400," we can commonly be"
3493.100,3495.000," in some measure great or small"
3495.900,3497.400," relieved of our"
3498.200,3498.500," sort of"
3499.400,3500.500," sort of entrapment"
3501.600,3502.300," in our"
3503.500,3505.200," human habits of mind and heart"
3508.400,3508.900," you know and"
3509.800,3510.600," this is"
3511.800,3513.300," this is kind of our theme"
3514.400,3514.700," for these"
3515.500,3515.900," sessions"
3517.000,3517.600," and I want to"
3520.000,3523.100," remind all of you if you if you forgotten"
3523.900,3524.900," that this program"
3525.500,3526.700," the original love programme"
3527.300,3528.800," and the way apps"
3529.200,3530.300," pathway are both"
3530.600,3532.400," built on a view of practice"
3533.500,3533.700," that"
3534.100,3536.400," comes from early Chinese Buddhism"
3537.500,3538.200," that is a kind of"
3539.500,3543.200," Tour of a blending or a combining or hybridisation"
3544.000,3544.200," of"
3545.100,3547.300," hardcore mahayana practice"
3547.900,3549.500," and fairly traditional"
3549.900,3552.400," terava or early Buddhist practice"
3553.100,3554.200," on the one hand"
3554.700,3556.000," the Tara approach"
3556.900,3557.900," is gradual"
3558.600,3559.500," programmatic"
3559.800,3560.200," development"
3561.300,3564.500," it's sort of gradually moving through series"
3565.500,3567.600," plural of different kinds of practice"
3568.300,3570.000," gradually kind of developing"
3570.500,3571.700," and moving from"
3572.500,3575.300," in a nutshell from sort of basic mindfulness"
3577.800,3579.900," getting a little bit of a handle"
3580.600,3583.300," on how we would our minds are how our"
3583.700,3584.800," untrained mind's"
3585.300,3586.500," bounce around or whatever place"
3587.500,3592.500," and even our trained practice Minds will still pass around all over the place from time to time"
3592.900,3594.200," but we're more aware of it"
3595.000,3597.000," and we have more tools for"
3597.800,3601.800," sitting in awareness of that and being less caught by"
3603.200,3603.500," it um"
3604.500,3604.900," and then"
3605.900,3606.000," the"
3606.600,3608.300," traditional Tara review is that that"
3610.100,3613.300," training in that mindfulness will gradually take us to toward"
3613.700,3615.100," samadhi essentially"
3615.700,3616.200," which is"
3617.000,3620.700," a more expansive and whole kind of awareness"
3621.400,3623.800," where we are less bound by"
3624.800,3629.000," our ordinary entangle sensor self or constricted sense of self"
3629.600,3630.300," we're more"
3631.700,3634.500," we arrived in a state of wholeness"
3635.400,3636.500," that's very pleasant"
3637.300,3638.500," very easeful"
3639.100,3640.000," and very aware"
3640.400,3641.100," and attentive"
3642.000,3642.500," and so"
3643.100,3643.900," that's a kind of"
3644.500,3646.500," Progressive path of development"
3647.100,3647.700," and in terms of"
3648.200,3648.700," the way"
3649.300,3649.600," and it's"
3650.000,3655.300," and it's sort of curriculum and it turns the original love view which is also expressed in the book of course original love"
3656.300,3660.700," this will be talking about the first Zone of practice and the third zone that's to say"
3661.500,3662.400," yeah mindfulness"
3663.000,3664.100," and the third zone being"
3664.700,3668.000," flow States essentially or samadhi or absorption States"
3670.300,3672.400," and but the there's a critical"
3673.300,3679.200," step in between sort of thing that I believe in which is what I've called zone two or the second in"
3679.800,3683.200," a practice in the book which is where we're getting more connected"
3684.300,3685.700," that we're realizing that"
3686.300,3689.300," the the path of development can't be just"
3690.000,3691.400," training my mind"
3692.100,3694.400," and then getting into my flow state"
3695.200,3697.800," it's actually the whole process is one of"
3698.400,3700.000," becoming less"
3701.100,3701.500," self"
3702.300,3702.800," fixated"
3704.000,3704.500," less"
3706.500,3707.900," really intract"
3708.400,3710.200," in an idea of who I am"
3711.300,3714.900," you know and there's there's so much that points to this in many different"
3715.400,3717.600," spiritual traditions there's a line I love from the"
3718.000,3718.800," New Testament"
3719.700,3720.100," here it is"
3720.700,3721.200," except"
3721.800,3724.400," a corner of wheat fall to the ground and die"
3724.800,3726.400," except a corner of wheat"
3726.700,3728.500," fall to the ground and die"
3729.100,3730.300," it abideth alone"
3730.900,3732.500," but if it fall"
3732.900,3733.600," and die"
3734.200,3735.100," it brings forth"
3735.700,3735.900," much"
3736.600,3736.900," fruit"
3738.800,3740.500," and less this little seed"
3741.000,3742.700," will to the ground and dies"
3743.300,3747.900," it just stays on his own as a little seed but if it falls and dies"
3748.400,3749.400," it bringeth forth"
3749.900,3750.600," much fruit"
3751.900,3752.700," I take that"
3753.700,3754.500," and I don't know whether"
3756.500,3757.600," whoever said that"
3757.900,3760.000," I don't think it was Jesus actually"
3761.000,3762.200," but I can't remember who it was"
3762.900,3763.900," but I take that"
3764.500,3766.100," as a beautiful metaphor"
3766.400,3767.600," unless this"
3768.100,3770.200," type little constricted self"
3770.800,3772.900," that are last I know only-- too well"
3773.500,3778.300," and less it falls to the ground and dies in abideth alone it carries on feeling"
3778.800,3781.100," as alone and separated it always thought it was"
3781.400,3784.100," but if it falls to the ground and dies"
3784.700,3785.500," much fruit"
3786.100,3786.700," comes from it"
3787.200,3789.000," in others we find actually that"
3789.900,3791.000," we turn into this"
3791.300,3792.800," the fruit of this whole earth"
3793.400,3795.600," eternally the fruit of this whole experience right now"
3796.000,3798.200," in other words if our little sense of self"
3798.800,3801.400," is given a context a soil"
3801.900,3803.400," in which it can germinate"
3803.900,3806.900," in a way we didn't know it was designed to Germany"
3807.400,3809.400," we didn't realise it had been containing"
3810.100,3811.700," all along the germ"
3812.200,3815.700," of a different life we've had intimations of it we've sensed it"
3816.200,3816.700," at times"
3817.200,3817.800," but if"
3820.500,3822.000," it's given the soil"
3822.800,3824.100," and it's allowed to fall"
3824.500,3824.900," and drop"
3825.400,3826.600," this little sense of self"
3826.900,3828.200," reveals it to be"
3828.800,3830.500," actually part of the whole earth"
3831.000,3831.700," that's why"
3832.400,3834.600," Sharon salzberg had a book called"
3835.100,3836.400," a heart as wide as the world"
3837.200,3838.600," heart as mine is at what"
3839.000,3839.700," that's why"
3840.500,3843.100," this little beautiful calligraphy here behind me"
3844.100,3844.900," is shin"
3845.600,3846.100," which means"
3846.800,3847.200," heart"
3847.500,3849.800," and mind in one heart mind"
3852.000,3854.200," this is done by yamada Cohen roshi"
3854.800,3858.700," very beautiful so on this sort of dark purple silk I don't know how well"
3859.400,3863.000," Xoom is relaying the the coloration here is beautiful"
3864.300,3864.900," dark purple"
3865.600,3867.700," dark mode very dark mode silk"
3868.100,3868.900," with this white"
3869.500,3870.200," brush stroke"
3870.900,3871.300," shin"
3872.000,3872.600," heart mind"
3873.100,3874.200," heart mind meaning"
3875.400,3876.600," this heart"
3877.100,3879.200," with all its troubled and all its joys"
3880.500,3881.600," but also this heart"
3882.200,3882.800," experienced"
3883.600,3885.500," and a slightly deeper level as"
3887.400,3890.400," something that gets touched when I feel"
3890.900,3891.100," more"
3892.100,3892.400," connected"
3893.300,3895.200," and that's what the second zone is about"
3896.000,3897.300," of practice it's about"
3898.000,3899.700," being touched by"
3901.500,3904.100," essentially what we think of as outsiders"
3905.400,3909.000," other people of course the people we love the people that love us"
3909.700,3911.000," the people we don't love"
3911.400,3912.300," and learning to be"
3913.700,3914.200," more patient"
3915.300,3916.700," more compassionate with our own"
3919.000,3919.900," antipathies"
3921.300,3922.400," more compassionate"
3923.100,3924.400," to our own antipathies"
3925.200,3925.900," is actually"
3926.900,3930.800," a way of Awakening that sort of self-love that is very patient"
3932.100,3933.800," and kind to us ourselves"
3934.900,3935.800," is also aware of"
3936.300,3937.200," tapping into this"
3938.000,3942.300," deeper sense of connectedness of openness and we could say a vulnerability"
3943.200,3945.900," to that's what this second zone of practice is about"
3946.500,3949.000," but not only on the level of human relationships"
3949.900,3953.300," also on the level of our place in this"
3954.100,3954.500," world"
3955.200,3956.600," and This is the great topic"
3957.200,3957.500," I would"
3959.100,3961.700," suggest actually of Zen"
3962.200,3963.700," this is what makes Zen"
3964.200,3964.800," as a tradition"
3966.500,3968.900," slightly but significantly different"
3969.800,3970.900," from other forms"
3971.900,3972.300," of"
3975.100,3976.500," spiritual training"
3977.000,3977.100," in"
3977.700,3979.000," Asia and East Asia"
3979.600,3980.700," if this is not 100%"
3981.600,3984.500," correct okay so just take it as gestural not hard"
3985.000,3986.100," not hardline at all"
3986.600,3988.500," but there is a way in which then"
3989.400,3989.900," offers"
3991.800,3992.900," invites us to"
3993.900,3994.700," experience"
3995.700,3998.000," the greatest teaching"
3998.400,3999.500," that we will ever"
4000.100,4002.700," find the most person and an important teaching"
4003.100,4003.800," as well ever had"
4004.500,4005.500," not has been"
4007.800,4008.100," so sort of"
4009.400,4012.700," a practice tips on how to meditate more skillfully"
4013.300,4014.000," or"
4015.700,4019.200," features of consciousness and capacitors of consciousness and"
4019.800,4022.300," so the engineering of consciousness that we can explore"
4022.800,4023.100," not"
4023.500,4024.300," actually that"
4024.900,4027.400," it's the real heart is end seems to be saying"
4028.700,4033.200," there is only one true teacher and it's the world"
4034.300,4036.900," that you're very experienced of the world"
4037.600,4037.900," right"
4038.400,4038.900," now"
4039.300,4042.800," not in some other special time that we're going to get to later"
4043.600,4044.800," but right now"
4046.100,4047.200," feeling your body"
4048.500,4052.100," seeing what you're seeing okay you know some of you looking at the screen I can tell"
4052.400,4053.300," you know so you're seeing"
4053.800,4055.200," Henry in his room"

4058.900,4062.200," beautiful image by his beloved wife Claire Dunn"
4062.600,4065.100," and which is a papercut by the way of a vulture"
4065.500,4068.100," and a beautiful image by yamada cone Rosie and this lovely"
4068.600,4070.800," by the plant I've always loved spider plants"

4073.000,4074.400," you can hardly go wrong with them"
4074.900,4075.800," they survive anything"
4076.400,4077.600," any kind of mistreatment"
4078.400,4084.500," they bounced back I love him and I love the way they waterfall down I've actually got a much bigger one around the corner maybe"
4084.900,4086.100," next week I'll bring that one right"

4099.800,4101.900," because this is really happening"
4102.400,4103.900," and what does that mean"
4105.000,4107.200," I'm holding something in this hand"
4107.600,4108.500," what is a hand"
4108.800,4109.400," who's holding"

4184.200,4184.900," of coffee"
4185.700,4188.300," is like take nothing for granted"
4189.000,4189.900," no nothing"
4192.000,4192.500," just this"
4194.400,4195.000," and of course"

4213.600,4213.800," what"
4214.600,4214.800," is"
4215.500,4216.600," actually going"
4217.400,4217.600," on"
4222.600,4222.700," so"
4225.700,4226.000," then"
4227.300,4228.200," uses"
4229.600,4230.300," all this"
4232.700,4234.400," because actually all this"
4235.300,4235.600," is"
4236.200,4236.600," the Great"
4237.500,4237.900," wonder"

4239.900,4240.500," mystery"
4245.000,4245.800," and at the same time"
4247.600,4248.200," it's true"
4249.500,4250.700," that there's a little bit"
4251.200,4252.000," of a bias"
4252.400,4254.100," a little bit of a preference"
4255.000,4255.700," Zen"
4256.100,4256.900," loves"
4257.400,4258.500," the Natural World"
4259.700,4261.000," it developed at a time"
4261.800,4264.200," in human cultural history Tang Dynasty China"
4265.200,4268.000," when I think for the first and possibly last time"
4269.000,4271.100," until perhaps these days now"
4272.000,4272.900," beginning in"
4275.000,4275.200," the"
4276.200,4278.000," late 18th century"
4278.400,4282.100," you can see the strains of it developing When Nature was valued"
4283.300,4283.900," rised"
4284.400,4285.100," cherished"
4285.300,4287.700," even revered even worshiped"
4288.500,4289.100," above"
4290.000,4291.700," chrono quote civilization"
4292.700,4297.900," in tang in Asti China it was a very sophisticated kind of cultural environment"
4298.600,4302.000," there was complex courtly life that was great poetry there was"
4303.400,4303.500," you know"
4304.200,4306.800," extremely sort of elaborate ritualistic"
4307.300,4312.500," life and the courts and thousands of people involved in that and the general bureaucracy was"
4313.100,4314.700," sort of highly educated and"
4315.900,4318.000," and they thought that the best thing you could do"
4319.500,4322.000," all these sophisticates if you could"
4322.900,4324.600," was go off to the mountains"
4325.300,4326.000," and sit"
4326.700,4328.900," sit in a monastery sit in a hermitage"
4329.500,4332.800," sit in your own little heart if you could find one sit in a cave"
4333.600,4334.000," sit"
4334.600,4335.500," be in"
4337.700,4339.100," the mountains the rivers"
4339.700,4340.500," and the great Earth"
4341.600,4343.500," leaving as they call it the red dust"
4344.900,4346.800," of the delusive life"
4347.400,4348.000," of the cities"
4349.100,4349.400," hi"
4350.700,4351.800," in the mountains"
4352.100,4355.400," in the gorgeous in the clouds in the forests in the rivers"
4356.500,4357.100," you could find"
4358.500,4358.900," truth"
4360.000,4360.600," you could find"
4362.800,4365.500," you could get a step up to ward"
4367.500,4369.000," what human life really"
4369.700,4370.000," is"
4376.200,4376.300," now"
4377.600,4385.400," and that gets expressing lots of different ways in this end tradition for one thing monks and nuns monastics were known as unsweetened"
4386.500,4386.900," which is a"
4387.400,4389.100," hyphenated thing it means"
4390.400,4392.900," clouds rivers unsui"
4393.300,4395.700," un is a cloud or young in Chinese"
4396.600,4398.300," is a cloud suite rivers"
4399.100,4399.600," unsui"

4408.100,4408.600," Waters"
4410.000,4410.900," what does that mean"
4411.800,4412.000," well"
4412.700,4413.100," one"
4414.600,4414.900," one"
4415.900,4416.200," image"
4417.000,4418.600," or one suggestion is"
4419.700,4420.000," you know"
4421.500,4422.400," what is our self"
4423.400,4423.900," a cloud"
4425.300,4426.800," what is our mind a cloud"
4427.500,4428.900," what is our heart a cloud"
4429.600,4430.900," What is this body a cloud"
4432.000,4435.300," What are we a cloud of sensations a cloud of experience"
4436.300,4437.200," with no center"
4438.300,4440.900," with no coagulated me at the heart"
4442.000,4442.300," just the"
4443.600,4445.100," a field of experience"
4446.700,4448.700," constantly forming and reforming"
4450.200,4450.900," like a cloud"
4454.700,4456.100," constantly changing shape"
4456.700,4458.200," the flux of experience"
4458.800,4459.600," and so actually"
4461.600,4465.500," the practitioner the the monastic the dedicated practitioner"
4466.500,4466.700," is"
4469.200,4470.100," dedicated"
4470.300,4471.200," to living that way"
4471.700,4472.200," as"
4473.100,4473.700," one"
4475.600,4476.800," who aspires to"
4478.400,4479.300," blend with"
4479.700,4482.400," the constant Flux and flow and unfolding"
4483.400,4483.500," of"
4484.000,4484.200," this"
4485.900,4487.400," experience called life"
4488.700,4490.100," and not solidifying things"
4491.100,4491.700," I am in here"
4492.400,4492.700," in a"
4493.500,4495.100," shelf is out there actually"
4495.800,4496.900," it's a co arising"
4498.700,4499.900," it's a co-organizer"
4503.000,4504.600," and then the Swede the river Park"
4505.800,4506.900," actually flowing"
4507.800,4509.500," not resisting but flowing"
4512.000,4513.200," and not knowing"
4516.000,4516.500," where we're going"
4518.900,4520.000," flowing without knowing"
4524.600,4525.300," the Great"
4527.200,4527.500," sort of"
4528.400,4528.600," you know"
4530.400,4531.400," little shifts or"
4531.700,4533.000," entryways into"
4533.800,4534.800," a deeper life"
4536.000,4536.700," is that"
4537.100,4538.800," that moment that may come"
4541.200,4546.100," thousands of times tens of thousands of times when we realise we've been"
4547.200,4548.600," pretty sure we know what's best"
4550.200,4551.100," and all of a sudden"
4552.100,4552.800," there's a release"
4553.500,4556.700," it may be small it may be larger than some little surrender"
4558.300,4559.200," and we recognise"
4559.900,4560.300," maybe"
4560.900,4561.800," I don't know what's best"
4564.600,4565.600," maybe there's a hole"
4566.400,4568.400," much larger process going on here"
4569.400,4570.300," than my"
4571.000,4573.800," customary view which is like looking down a tube"
4575.900,4578.000," you know and suddenly there's a hit"
4578.700,4579.000," of"
4581.100,4582.100," whatever I don't know"
4584.800,4585.200," and"
4586.300,4590.700," it can be on different levels and I my nice nice suspicions and my hunch"
4591.400,4594.300," is that in all the levels of practice mindfulness"
4595.200,4596.400," connectedness and support"
4597.100,4599.400," flow States and Awakening it all of them"
4603.000,4603.400," that"
4604.900,4608.200," released that surrender that shift that is a kind of"
4608.900,4610.600," relaxing of my"
4611.200,4612.100," certainty"
4612.600,4613.100," of my"
4613.700,4614.800," conviction that I know"
4617.300,4617.600," I know"
4617.900,4619.900," what's going on and what should be going on"
4621.000,4622.800," that little release"
4624.200,4628.600," is the gateway in all those levels of practice but again and again and again"
4629.200,4630.000," because the Gateway"
4630.600,4633.200," is not just once the gateway is always here now"
4634.100,4635.600," so it's an eternal Gateway"
4638.100,4639.700," it's an eternal possibility of"
4640.400,4640.700," shift"
4642.800,4644.600," I mean right throughout the course of life"
4646.600,4647.600," it may get easier"
4648.400,4651.000," over time and it may get harder at times because"
4652.100,4653.500," new levels of challenge"
4654.500,4656.300," coming cut swing into our life and"
4657.000,4658.200," suddenly we tighten again and"
4658.900,4660.700," and there's something bigger and we don't know how to"
4661.200,4661.900," I'm tightened"
4662.600,4665.400," for a while and then practice if we have a practice"
4666.100,4669.400," it will help us it will teach us and we'll release again"
4670.400,4670.700," so we're"
4673.400,4673.600," yeah"
4674.100,4675.200," we are"
4676.900,4681.600," you know to whatever extent in some ways as practitioners as we are also"
4683.200,4684.300," cloud rivers"
4684.500,4685.300," runs away"
4686.300,4686.900," we're also"
4690.600,4693.500," dedicated to different degrees of course and"
4694.200,4697.100," you know this may resonate more from some of us and less for others"
4697.800,4699.100," but to the path"
4699.400,4700.200," of not knowing"
4701.100,4702.100," and not resisting"
4705.900,4706.900," just like the clouds"
4711.300,4712.500," and just like the rivers"
4719.900,4721.300," okay I just gonna actually"
4726.700,4727.800," yeah I want to"
4729.500,4730.700," I wanted to share a poem"
4731.100,4731.300," actually"
4732.300,4732.800," and I'm gonna"
4734.000,4736.500," I'm gonna throw this one into the mix this is a"
4737.600,4740.200," you know a fairly recent I mean for the last three years"
4741.200,4741.800," time of mine"
4742.500,4743.100," about"
4744.000,4747.500," kind of learning from a natural Force in this case the wind"
4749.000,4749.100," and"
4751.400,4754.200," I hope it's I hope it sort of clear I'll try to"
4754.600,4758.700," read it in a way that keeps it closed down by the sea and it's called lifeguard Hut"
4759.600,4760.500," lifeguard Hut"
4761.200,4762.400," there is no lie"
4763.100,4767.000," you know no shelter there's no lie behind the Stills of this lifeguard Hut"
4767.900,4770.800," when the Western is are blasting the coast"
4772.200,4775.800," and the spew in the water is thick with his own stirring"
4776.700,4779.500," and the wind in the ears is loud as the serf"
4779.900,4781.100," Roaring on the beach"
4782.400,4784.500," you get behind the struts anyway"
4785.000,4786.200," and think there may be a"
4786.700,4788.000," pocket of shade"
4788.800,4789.000," of"
4789.500,4791.000," refuge of shelter"
4791.900,4792.700," or maybe not"
4793.900,4795.900," this is how it is in time"
4796.500,4797.200," of Los"
4798.200,4799.200," a gale blows through"

4805.900,4808.600," breaking out all you thought you need it"
4809.200,4809.700," in the end"
4810.500,4811.800," the only shelter left"
4812.700,4814.200," is the last you'd think of"
4814.900,4817.200," the inimical element itself"
4818.300,4818.900," the wind"
4820.900,4822.300," whatever it is upended"
4823.000,4825.600," whatever it has upended and torn away"
4826.500,4828.200," it can harm no more"
4829.000,4829.600," go into"
4830.800,4831.500," it surrender"
4832.000,4833.300," to what is too strong"
4834.400,4835.000," to what"
4835.300,4839.300," you know can only upend your life because it already has"
4840.500,4841.800," bear your limbs"

4862.300,4864.000," in long white scarves"
4864.400,4865.900," the tumble and twist"

4964.600,4964.700," you know"
4966.800,4967.800," letting this world in"
4973.800,4975.900," okay so let us go to"
4977.800,4978.200," questions"
4978.900,4979.400," discussion"
4980.600,4980.900," um"
4982.800,4984.500," let's see what's coming up"
4984.900,4985.800," if you'd like to"
4987.800,4988.500," ask a question"
4990.200,4992.400," share something please raise a hand Judith hi"
4994.600,4995.400," I'm wait ah"
4996.500,4997.100," yeah go ahead"
5000.600,5001.600," I'm not hearing to this"
5006.000,5011.500," oh yeah she's I think you've got to connect all audio Judith I think I think you're doing it now it says it says you are"
5013.300,5014.300," not hearing you"
5017.000,5017.700," still connecting"
5025.500,5027.100," you know we could if anybody"
5027.500,5027.800," else"
5028.700,5030.400," do this let's try now can you say something"
5032.000,5032.800," not hearing it"
5033.200,5034.600," if I have anybody else wants to"
5035.800,5039.400," raise a hand go ahead while due to this is getting connected"
5041.000,5041.400," um"
5043.800,5046.200," and let me just see anybody else"
5047.500,5048.600," yeah Pablo hi"
5050.400,5050.500," yeah"
5051.400,5051.600," okay"
5053.200,5053.700," ah"
5054.000,5054.500," wow"
5055.100,5055.400," Henry"
5055.900,5056.300," what's up"
5058.500,5059.700," yeah oh yeah"
5060.100,5062.200," yeah a bit surreal to be here"
5064.200,5064.400," I"
5065.200,5065.400," move"
5066.900,5068.300," yeah tell us- what's going on yeah"
5073.900,5075.700," so there's this Extinction that um"
5076.400,5081.200," lock Kelly introduced me to which is the difference between attention and awareness"
5082.700,5083.000," and"
5084.500,5087.800," I hear in the in the meditations on the app and on the book that"
5088.800,5094.100," you're using the what appears to me you're using the words that as if they're the same bring your attention to x"
5094.900,5096.600," or bring your awareness to acts"
5097.100,5097.900," and I'd love to hear"
5098.500,5101.200," if you have a distinction between them and if you do"
5101.800,5102.600," how are they different"
5103.300,5103.500," yeah"
5104.000,5106.500," yeah that's great that's a friend of mine who talks about"
5107.200,5108.000," hey and awareness"
5108.200,5108.600," to this"
5110.300,5114.000," you know the idiom is pay attention to something and yeah awareness to something"
5114.500,5115.700," it's a great question I mean"
5116.200,5120.900," I would say you know the the conventional usage is that"
5121.500,5126.600," attention is like a laser focus you know it's like a point that you can point at something"
5127.200,5128.100," and awareness"
5128.600,5129.800," is wider than that"
5130.400,5131.500," it's it's um"
5132.000,5134.200," and how wide it is is the"
5134.900,5136.700," is the Field of enquiry really"
5137.300,5137.400," because"
5138.200,5139.600," you know we can be aware of"
5141.000,5141.600," this whole room"
5142.700,5144.500," you know we can be aware of"
5146.200,5146.400," this"
5147.300,5150.700," the Contours and and Fabric of this moment right now"
5152.100,5154.400," and we can also be aware of awareness"
5156.600,5156.700," but"
5157.400,5161.400," and then we can really get going with a deeper exploration of what"
5162.300,5164.400," actualy is awareness itself"
5165.200,5167.100," and that can be very fruitful to explore"
5167.700,5168.000," but I would"
5168.500,5169.900," I would say you know they"
5170.700,5172.600," I don't know actually where their I'm"
5174.100,5175.700," trying to think now if I"
5176.400,5181.200," use them interchangeably I don't think I do I would normally think of awareness as"
5181.900,5183.100," wide angle lens"
5183.800,5184.400," attention"
5186.200,5187.300," in a tight Focus"
5189.500,5189.700," yeah"
5190.300,5191.400," but don't get um"
5192.300,5194.800," you know you it's something for you to explore yourself"
5196.000,5200.300," you know of course one classic path of enquiries to just get clear that"
5201.100,5202.800," there's a boundless context"
5204.500,5208.700," in which everything is arising all our experience is being held in effect"
5209.400,5211.300," buy a size list space"
5212.700,5215.100," and some people would say well that's consciousness that's"
5215.900,5216.200," that's the"
5217.000,5218.400," unbounded consciousness"
5219.400,5219.600," and"
5220.900,5223.200," you know but that's something we can enquire into as well"
5225.800,5228.400," so let's let's leave that there and you do some enquiry"
5229.100,5231.700," okay so what I'm grasping is that"
5233.200,5236.600," attention is the focus and awareness is more of the expansiveness"
5237.400,5237.700," and"
5238.600,5240.400," play with both of them to see what I discover"
5241.100,5243.600," yeah exactly and especially if you're getting clear on"
5244.100,5245.400," the sense of awareness"
5245.900,5249.800," you know sort of a just see what it's like to be aware of awareness"
5251.600,5252.800," as your primary"
5254.400,5254.700," object"
5255.600,5256.300," see what happens"
5256.800,5257.100," oh"
5257.700,5260.800," okay thanks Pablo great hey Judas him- are you um"
5262.200,5264.100," connected apparently not I'm"
5265.000,5267.000," I'm so sorry can we how do we can"
5267.400,5268.800," can we help you this get"
5270.800,5272.900," yeah Judas you could try signing back in"
5273.400,5274.400," sign out sign back in"
5275.500,5275.700," because"
5276.200,5276.500," some"
5276.800,5277.800," yeah we're just not hearing you"
5280.100,5282.900," yeah okay or you could put it in the chat if you want"
5283.500,5284.600," you could write it in the chat"
5285.300,5285.500," okay"
5286.000,5286.600," okay cool"
5287.400,5288.300," to raise him-"
5294.400,5296.200," how are you Henry thank you"
5298.300,5298.600," thank you"
5299.600,5300.300," you're"
5302.000,5302.300," stunning"
5302.800,5303.700," gorgeous poem"
5304.200,5305.200," reminded me"
5305.800,5307.600," and since Pablo mentioned him"
5308.100,5311.200," of a quote I heard from Loch Kelly"
5312.100,5312.200," from"
5313.000,5315.100," gonna say this wrong garab"
5316.300,5316.900," dorgan"
5317.600,5319.100," deal or j e"
5321.200,5321.900," at any rate"
5323.500,5325.000," he says find your true"
5325.400,5326.100," nature"
5326.800,5328.300," recognise your true Nature"
5329.000,5330.200," decided as real"
5330.700,5332.500," and then proceed with Trust"
5333.200,5333.600," to the"
5334.200,5335.100," spontaneous"
5335.700,5336.400," unfolding"
5337.800,5340.200," and I I heard that in your"
5340.800,5341.100," poem"
5341.700,5342.900," of yielding to the wind"
5343.300,5344.700," so thank you very very much"
5346.400,5347.600," my question is this"
5349.100,5349.900," you said"
5351.100,5351.400," Zen"
5353.300,5355.100," the great topic of Zen"
5356.000,5358.200," zen offers or invites us"
5358.900,5361.200," to the to experience the world"
5363.200,5365.800," I wish you could say just a little more about that I"
5367.400,5372.000," yeah okay well this is what we will you know I know it's big and we'll be we'll be"
5373.200,5375.000," we'll be exploring that you know over these"
5376.000,5377.000," 3 sessions together"
5377.900,5382.300," but let me say this point in in a really brief sort of sketch of it"
5382.600,5382.800," but"
5385.100,5386.600," there's these different levels"
5387.500,5391.500," of Engagement of a liveness that we can find and"
5392.100,5395.200," I don't want to put everything on just one one of the"
5395.700,5398.500," hazards of any path of practice as it will"
5398.900,5399.700," it will it will Focus"
5401.000,5402.200," it will have his favorite"
5403.200,5403.700," area"
5403.900,5405.800," and it'll make might focus on it"
5406.500,5410.000," to the exclusion of other beneficial areas of development"
5410.700,5411.200," and that's my"
5412.200,5413.200," main kind of"
5415.600,5417.400," motivation really for doing this"
5418.400,5419.700," that Book original love and"
5420.400,5423.700," this approach of all zones of development"
5424.800,5427.500," now on the deepest level or in Awakening"
5428.400,5431.700," where we're finding that we in the world are not separate"
5432.500,5434.000," that the sense of separate"
5434.700,5435.400," is just"
5436.000,5436.700," an experience"
5437.100,5438.400," arising within"
5438.900,5440.200," a much wider context"
5440.800,5443.400," and that sense of separate nests"
5443.600,5444.600," can be seen"
5445.000,5446.400," to be nothing more than"
5448.900,5450.000," cluster of thoughts"
5450.400,5451.400," and sensations"
5452.000,5452.600," that can"
5453.800,5455.100," either evaporate"
5455.600,5457.500," or just be seen clean"
5458.100,5458.300," through"
5459.200,5460.200," and then we find"
5461.100,5462.600," that we are none other than"
5463.200,5465.000," the world we thought we were not"
5466.000,5467.200," we've make this construction"
5468.300,5469.200," in our in"
5469.400,5470.000," our in our"
5470.400,5473.200," awareness in our consciousness in our minds"
5473.800,5474.000," that"
5474.800,5477.800," I am contained by this skin bag I'm in here"
5478.800,5478.900," and"
5479.300,5479.700," everything"
5480.300,5482.500," outside the skin bag is not me"
5485.300,5486.400," and I'm separate from it"
5487.700,5487.800," and"
5488.500,5490.200," actually the title of this"
5490.700,5491.300," little course"
5492.300,5493.200," is a quote from"
5495.600,5496.200," a bit of"
5497.100,5498.700," teaching that triggered a"
5499.100,5502.600," famous great Awakening experience in the 20th century of"
5503.300,5506.700," precisely yamada cone Roshe Who drew this calligraphy"
5507.600,5510.400," and he said he was reading this line of dogen"
5512.500,5517.400," I came to realise that the mind of that the mind of bright wisdom"
5518.100,5521.500," was nothing other than the sun moon and stars"
5522.400,5525.100," the mountains the rivers and the great Earth"
5525.600,5530.200," or more simply I came to realise that my own mind"
5530.800,5531.200," was"
5532.000,5533.500," the son the moon and the stars"
5534.100,5536.600," the mountains the rivers and the great Earth"
5537.400,5539.700," your mother cone Roshe read that line"
5540.400,5541.800," and it really caught his attention"
5542.300,5545.600," and it reflected on it reflected on it and suddenly in the middle of the night"
5546.900,5548.100," he woke up into"
5549.200,5553.100," a very profound Awakening experience when everything fell away"
5553.700,5554.300," he said later"
5555.100,5556.800," heaven and earth were reduced to dust"
5558.300,5560.300," or annihilated and reduced to dust"
5561.500,5564.700," and then a veritable tornado of delight"
5565.300,5565.700," and love"
5566.400,5567.000," welder"
5567.600,5569.200," and filled him and change his life"
5570.100,5574.400," and that was a realisation that actually the separatists of his mind"
5575.200,5576.100," and the whole world"
5576.700,5578.700," had been an illusion"
5579.800,5580.600," so that is"
5581.200,5581.600," sort of"
5582.400,5583.400," the deepest level"
5584.200,5584.500," of"
5585.900,5586.600," Discovery"
5587.200,5587.700," but I believe"
5588.300,5589.700," that there are other less"
5590.300,5590.700," profound"
5591.900,5594.300," shifts and discoveries we make in practice"
5594.900,5597.000," that are in their way equally valuable"
5597.800,5599.200," and so we mustn't be too"
5600.000,5604.000," fixated on I've just got to have the big Awakening that's a hazard in a tradition"
5604.900,5605.200," that is"
5606.500,5607.600," an Awakening tradition"
5608.300,5610.300," it's a hazard that we will"
5611.200,5614.100," defer okayness and till"
5614.600,5615.200," we've had"
5615.900,5616.500," a massive"
5616.900,5617.600," Awakening"
5618.000,5619.100," until then"
5619.600,5623.300," I'm deficient my practice is deficient I haven't got there yet"
5624.000,5626.100," always always we have got"
5627.300,5629.300," that always we're already there"
5630.100,5630.600," and that's something"
5631.100,5632.000," you know I'm"
5632.600,5633.400," committed to"
5634.000,5635.400," doing my best to help us all"
5635.700,5637.500," realise because actually it's also"
5638.200,5640.000," I mean once we realised that this is it"
5640.500,5641.700," this is it and there"
5642.600,5643.000," because I'm"
5643.600,5643.800," here"
5644.400,5645.800," I've arrived I'm here"
5646.500,5647.600," this is the fulfillment"
5648.500,5649.700," of my life right now"
5650.100,5650.500," already"
5651.000,5653.700," this is actually in some ways the fulfillment of the universe"
5654.300,5656.000," right now just here like this"
5656.800,5657.200," truly"
5658.000,5658.300," once we"
5659.600,5662.300," can get just a little sense of that might be true"
5663.700,5671.800," and so I'm wrong to be seeking some other conditions and other States that's not what practice is about ever it's always about"
5672.600,5674.000," how is it now"
5675.000,5676.300," that actually number one"
5677.000,5679.600," that feels better for us because we're not lacking"
5680.400,5682.200," we're realising even in my"
5682.800,5684.600," turbulence and distress and"
5685.100,5686.900," maybe hard times heart"
5687.500,5688.800," break this is it"
5690.200,5690.300," you know"
5691.000,5694.100," already that's a help to to know that but secondly"
5694.600,5696.100," it actually happens to be"
5696.800,5698.700," a better path to"
5699.600,5701.300," explosive Awakening experiences"
5702.700,5703.800," they're more likely"
5706.500,5706.500," to"
5708.900,5709.700," implode us"
5711.000,5711.900," we're more likely"
5712.900,5715.500," to collapse into what was already always already here"
5717.000,5717.600," if we're"
5720.200,5721.700," being"
5722.200,5724.400," here now with what is here now"
5726.900,5727.400," okay"
5728.000,5728.600," thank you to raise"
5729.000,5729.600," so uh"
5730.200,5732.400," just I hope I pronounce that right"
5734.100,5734.200," please"
5734.800,5735.100," go ahead"
5736.600,5738.300," hi can you hear me yes"
5739.200,5739.300," okay"
5740.600,5742.100," well first of all thank you for your"
5742.700,5743.600," teachings and"
5744.300,5746.400," since we're on the topic of letting go and"
5747.000,5748.500," specifically yielding to the Wynd"
5749.200,5753.200," I wanted to say that to me it definitely feels like I have not got there yet"
5753.900,5754.900," I've been meditating"
5755.400,5755.700," for"
5756.200,5757.400," a few years but"
5758.400,5759.000," and"
5759.300,5761.100," well I it really helps me to"
5762.100,5763.100," find some peace and to"
5763.800,5764.600," relax but"
5765.600,5767.800," well almost as soon as I get out of a session my"
5768.200,5769.200," thoughts continue and"
5770.100,5771.400," they are running wild and"
5772.300,5777.700," now lately I've been there there are have been a few specific activities during which"
5778.800,5783.400," well my mind just continues to wonder and it feels like every time I do this activity again"
5784.500,5785.400," well"
5786.200,5789.000," it becomes worse like I'm conditioning my mind to wonder"
5789.800,5789.900," and"
5790.800,5794.000," I am very aware of it but it seems to keep happening so"
5794.500,5794.700," I would"
5795.900,5797.400," I hope you have some advice on that"
5798.900,5801.800," that's that's well first of all that's that's a sign of"
5802.700,5805.100," of let's say progress in practice"
5805.600,5806.800," to be more aware"
5807.300,5808.700," of what our minds are doing"
5809.300,5809.800," is actually"
5810.400,5811.300," the path of practice"
5812.200,5814.400," so Congratulations that's all good"
5814.900,5816.000," now it might be frustrating"
5816.800,5817.100," because you get"
5817.600,5821.900," you're getting some taste now and then in your sitting I think it's I think I heard you say"
5822.500,5822.700," of"
5823.600,5825.600," perhaps more stillness and the moment you get up"
5825.900,5827.100," boom the mind start"
5827.900,5830.400," running off swinging through the branches like a monkey"
5831.100,5833.400," the branch is being thoughts and the monkey being"
5834.200,5838.900," us swinging from thought to thought to thought that's a traditional early Buddhist metaphor"
5839.600,5842.100," and you know the phrase monkey mind has come from that"
5842.700,5843.400," now what if"
5843.900,5846.500," rather than trying to stop that"
5848.400,5849.600," we try to"
5850.600,5851.500," be aware of it"
5852.300,5852.500," and"
5853.300,5854.200," allow it"
5856.500,5858.200," see I I believe that"
5859.000,5864.000," the path of fighting and resisting only tends to make things stronger"
5865.100,5865.500," so the"
5866.200,5866.200," the"
5866.900,5870.800," aspect of our experience that we want to get rid of will be"
5871.300,5871.600," probably"
5872.600,5875.500," typically fortified by our resistors to them"
5876.400,5876.900," there's some"
5878.200,5880.000," clever little phrase that something like"
5880.600,5882.200," what we resist persists"
5885.200,5885.200," so"
5886.200,5886.900," what's the alternative"
5888.100,5889.900," could there be one yes there is one"
5890.600,5891.900," it's not to resist"
5892.500,5893.500," is to allow"
5895.200,5897.900," so can and it's very clever this how this works"
5898.500,5900.800," I write about it in my book I said and"
5901.300,5903.200," if that's a little plug for the book"
5904.200,5905.700," we if we learn"
5906.500,5907.700," to allow"
5908.300,5909.300," what is going on"
5910.200,5914.700," what we're the the way that we seem to sort of get there is by"
5915.500,5918.700," somehow our sense of things"
5919.500,5920.100," are"
5920.500,5921.900," we might say our sense of awareness"
5922.700,5923.900," expands"
5924.300,5925.800," just a little bit"
5926.700,5931.500," it's the it's that's what allowing means the state of allowing"
5932.300,5933.400," is one in which"
5934.500,5935.800," we've gone from"
5937.000,5937.600," resisting"
5939.000,5944.700," no I don't want you swinging through my mind you thought or I don't want my mind behaving this way I'm resisting"
5945.500,5947.400," this experience as going on mentally"
5951.700,5952.500," going to"
5954.100,5955.000," the state of"
5956.100,5956.900," and allowing it"
5958.500,5959.300," allowing it"
5960.100,5961.500," that to allow something"
5962.500,5965.100," we actually kind of have to be"
5966.000,5966.500," aware of"
5968.700,5969.400," it I'm aware"
5970.700,5971.500," that there's"
5972.300,5974.100," not only this stream of thoughts"
5974.500,5977.200," there's probably also some frustration"
5978.300,5979.600," so I'm allowing"
5981.900,5982.900," that there be"
5983.300,5986.300," an affective state and emotional condition"
5989.600,5992.000," we might look for that in the body"
5993.000,5995.900," there's probably a kind of tightness somewhere in the"
5996.300,5997.400," diaphragm area"
5998.300,6000.000," that goes along with our"
6001.000,6002.600," not liking and resisting the"
6004.200,6005.100," the stream of thoughts"
6006.700,6007.900," so can we find that"
6009.300,6011.000," can we find the resistance"
6011.900,6012.400," to it"
6014.300,6014.700," and then"
6015.400,6016.600," can we let that be there"
6019.000,6020.400," can we just get into that"
6021.100,6023.300," space or that state of mind that says"
6024.100,6024.800," so be"
6025.600,6026.300," it Let It Be"
6027.000,6028.500," this is how it is right now"
6029.300,6030.700," I'm having a lot of thoughts"
6031.400,6032.800," and I'm resisting them"
6033.400,6034.800," I'm not wanting them"
6035.700,6039.800," I'm going to see if there's a way I can let this be the case"
6043.200,6043.700,"allow"
6045.800,6048.300," it not try to change it not try to get rid of it"
6049.000,6049.600," the opposite"
6050.600,6051.300," and allow it"
6052.900,6056.400," allow it so try that see where you where where that takes you"
6057.900,6058.600," thank you just"
6059.300,6059.600," thank you"
6060.200,6060.300," great"
6060.900,6063.100," now Judith I think you're you're on so let's"
6064.200,6066.300," let's bring you in next if you if you'd like"
6070.200,6071.100," ah yes"
6071.900,6071.900," good"
6076.200,6078.500," oh you have to accept and to unmute"
6082.200,6082.300," yeah"
6083.400,6083.600," okay"
6084.200,6084.300," yeah yeah"
6088.100,6088.100," I'm"
6090.300,6091.600," spoken to you before"
6092.200,6094.400," a while ago about"
6094.800,6098.300," how I studied with shins and for 29 years and I"
6101.300,6102.500," I talked to you about"
6104.300,6105.400," gone gone gone gone and"
6105.900,6107.100," all that okay so"
6108.400,6109.900," what I'm noticing now"
6110.600,6112.100," especially since I"
6112.500,6115.900," a clarified it yesterday you did a Q&A"
6116.800,6118.400," and you talked to somebody about"
6121.600,6126.200," meditating twice a day that was the hard line I I did TM first"
6126.700,6129.400," in my life too I'm 76 now"
6130.300,6131.500," so I've got everything else"
6132.200,6132.900," I can feel"
6133.400,6134.900," I mean that was the most fantastic"
6136.000,6136.900," dermatocranium"
6139.600,6140.300," you just"
6140.900,6142.900," cleared everything up from A to Z"
6145.300,6150.900," now I know this that I've be since I've been doing original love and what happened yesterday"
6152.100,6152.400," about"
6154.000,6156.600," meditating twice a day I stopped meditating"
6157.800,6158.400," I you know"
6159.100,6166.000," it was it just was the most natural thing to stop meditating and I had meditated hard since I was 21"
6167.200,6167.400," and"
6169.100,6169.500," now"
6170.200,6173.100," I'm noticed attention arising within me"
6173.600,6174.400," whenever I"
6176.600,6178.100," am with you on line"
6178.600,6179.200," and that is"
6182.200,6183.000," it's sort of"
6184.400,6185.700," hard sitting versus"
6186.200,6189.200," meditating all day long just naturally"
6190.100,6190.700," you know"
6191.400,6194.800," a million times a day noticing when I'm not comfortable"
6196.200,6197.500," and my heart is hurting"
6198.700,6201.700," and what what is going on and then scanning"
6202.300,6204.700," and then eventually I mean we're talking about"
6205.700,6206.800," minutes moments"
6207.500,6208.100," eventually"
6210.100,6212.100," being in somebody again depending how"
6213.000,6214.000," strong"
6216.400,6218.100," my reaction has been"
6218.700,6220.600," to whatever has come at me"
6221.800,6223.100," and so I feel like"
6223.600,6228.400," a meditating constantly it's the most natural thing in the world after doing so much"
6229.400,6232.200," I mean you know I'm just it's just all baked in"
6235.500,6239.900," so net but then I noticed I I have this tension every time"
6241.000,6241.100," I"
6242.600,6243.200," am with you"
6245.600,6254.300," meditating I should be meditating twice a day again and and then I get all the only thing about yeah"
6254.700,6257.900," yeah yeah yeah I hear you okay so nice pizza"
6258.400,6259.100," thoughts"
6259.300,6260.100," Henry please"
6260.900,6262.700," just be with me and talk to me please"
6263.500,6264.800," and thank you for doing that"
6265.600,6266.600," yeah thank you very much to"
6267.100,6270.500," yeah so this is a great point I mean it's not going to be relevant for"
6271.500,6272.500," that many people"
6273.000,6274.300," I think in this program"
6274.700,6276.500," but it could be that"
6277.300,6282.800," you know there's in the in the in the later sort of stages or something of practice or though"
6283.300,6286.600," we were you know we're always cautious about that but"
6287.100,6290.000," because it goes on forever but I know until you die until"
6290.700,6290.900," you're that's what"
6291.100,6291.100," I"
6292.100,6293.100," know yeah exactly so"
6293.500,6299.400," what do we do then like is there do we keep meditating some traditions are saying no absolutely not once you've"
6300.000,6302.400," clearly Awakened there's no point meditating anymore"
6303.200,6303.400," and"
6304.400,6311.300," really and and that Nan the what do they call the non-duality the advert advert of folks often seems to advocate that"
6311.800,6312.700," and some of them are even"
6314.000,6318.200," somewhat questioning about the value of meditation anyway some advice are folks I've heard"
6318.900,6319.300," but um"
6320.100,6322.900," on the other hand so you know on the other hand you've got"
6324.000,6326.700," you've got these the Zen tradition in which"
6328.000,6334.300," nobody stops meditating no reason you know the reasons for doing it of course will radically change"
6334.900,6335.700," but Logan"
6336.800,6337.800," just felt that"
6338.500,6340.300," I mean you can read him on this amazing"
6341.300,6343.700," work he's got called continuous practice in a"
6344.100,6345.600," that you're meditation"
6347.700,6350.400," is what enables the sun moon and stars"
6350.800,6351.700," two exist"
6352.600,6353.800," your practice"
6354.300,6356.500," is what enables the mountains rivers and the great Earth"
6357.100,6357.900," to exist"
6358.400,6359.900," you're the idea that you're"
6360.600,6362.600," you know you're meditating for any kind of"
6363.300,6364.300," you know personal"
6365.800,6370.000," benefit or or engineering or the mind or anything like that"
6370.300,6371.600," it completely gone"
6372.200,6373.400," there's no meditation"
6374.200,6375.600," but any purpose whatsoever"
6376.800,6378.600," and that's the reason to do it"
6379.600,6382.600," you know the reason to do it is that there's no reason to do it"
6384.700,6391.600," but you know but you but you know but that that doesn't mean you have to do it you know you've you just feel it out yourself I mean the other thing I was going to say to this"
6392.200,6393.900," the instructive thing probably"
6394.600,6397.000," is B with that tension"
6398.000,6399.900," it's some things trying to tell you something"
6400.800,6402.900," you know and just just you know be very open"
6403.900,6406.300," you don't have to sit you don't have to not sit"
6406.800,6407.500," who knows"
6407.900,6409.000," Henry certainly doesn't know"
6409.700,6410.000," and you know"
6410.600,6411.700," Degan had a view"
6412.400,6416.800," shankara probably had a different view I didn't know you know there's lots of different"
6417.700,6418.400," who knows"
6419.500,6425.800," you know it's not like I'm not sitting I'm talking about formal sitting and it's I'm sick for me"
6426.700,6432.000," I'm sitting on I'm sitting 24 hours a day you know I'm even sitting in my dreams"
6432.800,6436.800," and what would you know without formally putting my ass on the cushion"
6437.400,6440.900," yes yes yes well maybe we don't call it sitting I mean there's"
6441.600,6445.700," there's you know that you know the the the the the the Old view that there's four"
6446.500,6448.000," positions in which Zen"
6448.300,6448.900," is done"
6449.600,6451.200," sitting standing lying"
6451.800,6456.000," and walking slash activity those are the four postures"
6456.600,6458.100," so you're you're doing it in"
6459.100,6461.800," posture number four number two number three"
6462.400,6462.900," and number one"
6463.500,6464.700," when you happen to be sitting down"
6465.600,6466.200," alright and"
6466.500,6467.900," you know but"
6468.300,6470.300," be with the tension that's the interesting"
6471.000,6472.600," okay- thanks thanks you"
6473.500,6474.400," beautiful okay"
6475.000,6478.700," Joe let's say we might have time for one or two more"
6480.600,6480.700," yeah"
6481.400,6481.900," Joe hi"
6482.400,6482.600," hi"
6483.100,6484.000," thanks a lot"
6484.800,6489.400," beautiful words today Henry and lovely guy did meditation and"
6490.500,6492.800," it would like to just share how much you"
6494.000,6496.400," your books and meditations of"
6497.000,6498.300," touched me personally for"
6499.000,6500.800," some months so thank you"
6501.600,6501.700," and"
6502.600,6505.200," my question is just a curiosity from"
6505.800,6506.800," descriptions of"
6507.200,6510.400," Awakening really and you've touched today on the"
6511.100,6512.100," descriptions of"
6512.700,6516.000," I think my own mind is the sun the Earth and the rivers"
6516.400,6516.900," and talking"
6518.100,6521.100," about nature and the non-human world"
6522.000,6527.700," and in the many descriptions of Awakening mainly that I've read of yours and"
6528.400,6529.300," it is with the"
6530.000,6531.500," physical world that I hear"
6532.200,6535.200," the description and I'm curious my curiosity is found"
6536.200,6537.300," other people in that"
6538.000,6542.000," the it's in an experience of Awakening and"
6543.600,6548.300," what what is it like to experience other people and other people's Minds"
6549.100,6549.600," in that"
6550.200,6551.900," because in our"
6552.500,6555.100," normal kind of dual sense of things"
6555.800,6559.700," there are other people in the zoom call for example but"
6560.900,6563.900," that might the whole idea of The Awakening seems that"
6565.400,6569.300," that Vanishes everything is one and I'm curious"
6569.900,6570.700," how yeah I haven't"
6571.200,6574.000," seen other people brought into the descriptions"
6574.900,6575.200," that's my"
6576.700,6579.000," yeah I could be that some people talk about"
6579.700,6579.800," you know"
6580.400,6580.600," we"
6581.200,6581.600," actually"
6582.600,6584.500," we all share"
6585.300,6585.400," this"
6587.500,6590.300," what your mother and call the common Plaza"
6591.400,6592.800," a common Plaza"
6593.500,6595.100," that we all share it's not that we"
6596.300,6596.400," we"
6597.100,6600.700," share it in that we meet there we actually are that"
6601.100,6602.400," common Plaza"
6604.000,6604.100," and"
6605.800,6609.600," you know what he was he died in 1989 but he was really"
6610.300,6612.700," passionate in his last decade especially like"
6613.400,6615.600," how it could change the world if more"
6616.100,6617.800," people knew about this"
6618.700,6621.200," if more people knew about it through their own experience"
6621.700,6622.500," that there's a"
6623.100,6626.300," there's a part there's a level of our experience in which"
6627.200,6629.000," we just aren't separate from one another"
6629.600,6630.100," now that's"
6630.600,6632.400," but you see the thing is you know in in"
6633.300,6635.000," my own a Buddhism"
6636.100,6637.300," that's actually"
6638.600,6640.500," kind of not the end of the road"
6641.400,6641.600," because"
6643.000,6644.400," the fact is that"
6645.400,6647.500," this is a world of month of multiplicity"
6648.500,6650.300," and infinite diversity"
6651.000,6651.300," and"
6652.100,6652.900," of one this"
6653.900,6654.300," both"
6655.300,6656.100," and the real"
6657.200,6659.400," seems to be that the real"
6660.700,6662.200," you know the real sort of"
6664.300,6665.200," threshold or"
6666.100,6667.400," pump we can get over"
6668.600,6671.400," well first one is recognising that one this"
6672.400,6673.000," personally"
6674.300,6675.400," in Direct experience"
6676.000,6677.200," and then another hump"
6677.500,6678.000," is when"
6679.100,6680.100," the world of oneness"
6681.100,6682.600," and the world of multiplicity"
6683.200,6683.400," and"
6683.900,6686.500," diversity infinite multiplicity"
6688.000,6688.300," are"
6689.600,6690.800," recognised to be"
6691.800,6692.600," one in the same"
6693.700,6694.700," that is not one"
6695.500,6696.000," or the other"
6696.700,6697.800," they've always been"
6698.500,6698.900," one"
6699.500,6699.900," and that"
6700.400,6701.400," doesn't compute"
6702.300,6703.800," our brains can't compute that"
6705.000,6706.400," but we can experience it"
6707.400,6708.400," we can't find it"
6709.500,6709.700," we can"
6710.500,6711.800," we can recognise"
6713.700,6714.700," that's how it really is"
6718.600,6721.300," so let me just think have I yes I think I have addressed"
6721.600,6722.200," what you were saying"
6723.600,6724.400," it's a fire is my"
6725.000,6728.600," weak mind can check I think so okay let's leave it there"
6729.200,6729.800," there's more to say"
6730.400,6734.000," we'll just do one more question not for too long"
6734.500,6735.000," Matthew"
6736.500,6741.300," yeah yeah so first of all thank you for your continual voice as same here as labeled it"
6742.200,6743.700," congenial I like it"
6744.200,6747.800," the second thing is you're meditation recently on the way move me as"
6748.400,6751.200," label your meditation or your thoughts as"
6752.400,6753.200," planning"
6754.400,6757.500," imagination or memory I think if I get that right"
6758.000,6762.500," planning was so those work so good later that day I was in yoga class"
6762.800,6765.400," every thought that came my mind A wave of planning"
6765.800,6768.100," like okay now it's imagination I'm the ocean"
6768.700,6770.000," doing yoga cool"
6770.800,6772.600," but this is a very it's interesting"
6773.200,6775.200," as I've already explained to him pretty late here"
6775.600,6780.300," my planning those Waze became a thunderstorm of wave the waves were like oh I cannot"
6780.700,6781.600," focus on the present"
6782.000,6784.300," now it's what am I going to say what I'm going to say what I'm going to say"
6784.800,6788.200," so I can never be in the present moment when I plan to raise my hand early"
6788.800,6794.100," then I'm not really listening anymore and I'm just planning playing planning and I cannot get away for that"
6794.500,6797.000," and my other joke on there was you've made me switch this"
6797.400,6801.600," it's no longer attention deficit disorder I have it's awareness deficit sort of"
6802.600,6802.900," that's it"
6804.000,6805.800," you could label a book that I think"
6806.500,6812.400," yes yes that would be a very good book for all of us that's great thank you very much"
6812.800,6813.700," what I really"
6816.200,6819.500," I don't think there was a question that I think that was good observation on your part"
6820.400,6820.800," so ok"
6821.300,6821.500," yeah"
6821.900,6822.400," just um"
6823.000,6823.100," you know"
6824.800,6826.300," if if it gets too much"
6826.800,6829.000," any time it gets too much go into the body"
6830.000,6834.600," yeah and because they'll be they'll be some emotion they'll be some feeling in the chest or in the Bell"
6835.000,6835.500," or the"
6836.200,6838.500," so go there they'll be some kind of tightness"
6840.600,6842.500," tension heaviness something"
6843.400,6844.200," and rest with that"
6844.800,6845.800," when you still hear me"
6847.000,6847.500," what's that"
6847.900,6848.600," can you still hear me"
6849.000,6850.400," yes I guess the question is"
6850.700,6854.000," just don't raise my hand and get voided or raise my hand and"
6854.900,6857.300," yeah totally raise your hand and just"
6857.700,6859.300," be with whatever storm comes"
6859.900,6860.300," huh"
