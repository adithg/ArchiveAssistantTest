63.800,65.400," where you're zooming in from"
66.200,69.100," and maybe a word or two about the the weather"
69.700,70.300," either"

140.900,142.100," all over the world"
147.500,150.600," all right so keep those coming in and"
155.700,156.600," I am going to"
158.000,160.300," turn it over to Henry now"
164.900,165.200," and"
166.300,166.900," Henry"
167.300,171.400," yeah oh please guide us down the Royal Road of the breath"
173.000,176.500," hello thank you so much Sarah and thank you everybody and great to be with you"
177.200,179.600," on this Sunday morning we've got"
181.000,185.300," wild to the allergy season here in Santa Fe because there's juniper's here that"
186.400,189.100," people people move here have never had allergies"
189.700,191.100," and when they get here to"
193.000,199.900," early late febuary early March Santa Fe that when the juniper start releasing this sort of it's like a yellow smoke"
200.500,204.100," quite beautiful actually that on a windy day you can see it's streaming off"
204.900,205.900," the juniper's and"
207.300,213.300," and but it's it's a wild it's a wild kind of energy that is very intense you know people"
214.000,214.300," people"
215.200,216.100," can really"
217.000,217.600," feel sort of"
218.500,222.900," much more than just the usual allergy symptoms of sneezing and"
223.400,224.300," eyes running but"
224.800,227.400," actually kind of gets inside your nervous system in a weird way"
227.800,228.000," and"
229.000,231.400," I've been suffering a little bit from it myself so"
232.200,237.500," I hope I'll be kind of clear enough I could feel like probably needed another cup of coffee actually"
238.400,241.900," a second cup of coffee rather strong this morning but we'll see"
242.700,244.500," what it's like to do this"
245.800,251.100," to share and be with you all and in us maybe slightly more kind of Cloudy state than"
252.000,256.000," a pollen clouded a yellow pollen cloud sort of enveloping my"
256.500,258.500," my brain and nervous system today"
259.200,264.200," but hopefully enough of what matters to us most in these sessions of what we're"
264.900,270.100," really doing when we come to Meditation and when we come to a meditation gathering"
270.800,272.900," what are we really doing it for and"
273.300,274.200," of course there's a"
274.800,279.200," multiplicity of avenues and approaches and angles that we might all"
280.000,285.400," have for why we're doing this and sometimes we don't even know very clearly that's fine too but"
286.200,288.300," even when we have a clear purpose"
290.800,294.700," is it actually possible to say that there's only one ultimate purpose"
295.300,297.600," of meditation that's something to explore because many"
298.500,303.300," many traditions might feel that it does have a fundamental purpose"
306.600,307.800," but is there such a thing"
308.100,308.600," who knows"
309.000,310.200," we can explore that"
310.700,312.700," as a wonderful thing to explore actually"
316.200,317.300," but I think probably"
318.100,318.300," on"
318.900,319.000," all"
319.700,322.800," levels of all angles of purpose"
323.600,326.200," we might say that there's something like"
329.300,330.500," our normal way of being"
332.200,335.900," some call it horizontal meaning that we're"
337.000,337.700," feeling like a"
338.700,340.800," an entity or being of some kind that's"
341.500,342.700," relating to the world"
343.300,346.000," in front of us to the sides of us behind us"
346.300,348.100," on a kind of horizontal plane"
349.100,349.800," and we're trying to"
351.700,353.000," negotiate it all"
353.400,356.300," in the way that we hope will work best for us"
357.700,358.200," um"
358.900,362.400," and also best for those that we care about most"
365.000,365.900," whereas"
366.900,367.900," in all cases"
368.600,372.100," however we frame this ore or view this or whatever we think it might be"
372.800,375.900," there's also a kind of vertical axis actually"
376.300,377.000," operational"
377.700,379.300," that we might not notice"
380.400,381.100," and that"
381.600,381.800," is"
382.800,385.700," you know we can understand that in various different ways"
386.700,388.900," but some kind of interruption"
390.400,391.600," of our horizontal"
392.700,393.000," journey"
393.900,394.400," whereby"
396.200,398.600," something amplifies our sense of things"
399.300,399.900," gets deeper"
401.400,402.400," or broader or"
403.300,404.000," ampulla"
405.200,408.200," that somehow what what what our life is"
409.200,410.100," is not just"
411.000,411.600," a linear"
412.100,412.400," thread"
413.600,414.500," it's not just a"
415.500,416.100," you know a"
418.300,419.500," sort of target practice"
419.800,421.400," as it were it's not just that"
422.300,423.000," there's something"
423.700,424.200," happening"
424.800,426.200," already right here"
429.600,431.000,"that's got a vertical"
431.600,433.100," sense to it meaning deeper"
434.100,435.600," and possibly higher I don't know"
436.400,436.800," you know but"
437.300,438.000," not just"
440.700,443.200," travelling in a certain Direction instead"
444.000,445.200," just by being here"
445.900,447.500," there's an there's an amplitude"
448.900,450.700," that if we're still"
451.900,455.600," or that's not the only practice but our practice is being still meditation"
456.000,456.700," if we're still"
457.500,459.500," we can find that we open up"
460.600,462.600," and so what had seen to be"
465.200,466.900," the one and only ground of life"
467.500,470.800," turns out merely to have been a certain kind of surface"
472.200,473.200," and we can actually"
474.700,476.500," somehow drop below that surface"
478.600,478.800," so"
480.100,480.500," ah"
480.900,481.200," now"
481.700,483.000," coming to the theme of the day"
483.600,485.800," I have to make a rather"
487.000,491.100," slightly apologetic announcement that this shit the theme is actually shifted a little bit"
491.700,491.900," and"
493.400,500.900," it needed to for reasons I don't fully understand but it has it's it's the we're going to be looking at the breath but we're also going to be looking at that"
501.600,502.600," the core"
503.700,504.400," part of Us"
505.200,506.300," that every breath"
506.900,507.900," experientially"
508.500,509.500," seems to pass through"
510.600,512.300," namely this heart area"
513.400,515.600," every breath is an inspiration"
516.600,518.100," through the heart area"
519.000,520.000," and an expiration"
520.900,522.100," through the heart area"
523.000,523.600," it travels"
524.100,524.800," back and forth"
525.900,526.200," to sort of"
526.900,527.600," irrigating"
528.700,531.000," and expanding and then"
532.600,534.300," emptying and releasing"
535.100,537.800," through the heart area the heart area so"
538.400,539.600," actually we're going to be looking at"
540.500,541.200," Kinder"
542.000,542.800," that area"
543.300,545.300," you know above all because it's the most"
546.300,551.600," maybe the most important thing that that we have possibly is to really get to"
552.200,552.300," be"
553.000,554.400," friends with"
555.300,556.200," this heart area"
556.700,557.000," is what"
557.800,559.400," can turn the life around I believe"
560.400,563.500," and and do exactly the kind of deepening"
564.300,565.000," that I was talking about"
566.300,568.900," don't exactly what the word deepening but"
569.500,570.300," opening to"
570.900,572.900," a different axis than just the horizontal"
575.500,578.500,"okay so that's a bit of a of a little"
580.500,581.500," juniper"
581.900,582.500," dude"
583.400,584.700," scramble"
585.300,586.800," scrambled egg introduction you know"
588.000,588.100," and"
589.500,589.600," yeah"
593.300,596.000," oh so there's an audio issue I didn't know hold on a sec"
605.800,606.600," okay let me see"
608.100,609.000," okay now has that"
609.300,613.000," improved those who are having sound trouble yeah somebody says fixed"
613.900,614.600," okay"
615.400,616.700," okay great great okay"
617.800,619.400," I think I know what it was um"
620.600,621.100," my apologies"
622.700,625.500," it was there actually a issue with hearing what I was saying"
626.500,628.900," do I need to repeat what I think you could all okay"
630.200,630.400," okay"
631.000,632.500," well let's go into our first set"
636.100,636.200," yeah"
636.800,637.400," that's some"
638.900,639.800," that's come into"
642.200,642.900," a comfortable"
645.600,646.200," seated"
646.600,646.900," position"
651.200,651.900," let yourself"
652.400,654.800," come in gently you know in other words"
655.700,656.400," invite"
656.900,659.000," your yourself to be moving"
661.400,662.200," towards stillness"
663.200,663.700," to kind of"
664.600,665.600," whatever you need to do"
666.500,670.600," in terms of just a little bit of body adjustment or flexing a spinal or whatever"
671.300,673.300," stretching whatever feels good and right for you"
674.300,675.400," that will help you"
678.600,679.200," come into"
681.500,683.400," a balanced position"
687.800,689.200," a position that's balanced"
692.100,692.400," and"
698.200,698.900," ready to"
700.200,701.100," start relaxing"
705.200,706.300," they in"
708.100,712.800," in some xandos I I trained in the east to talk about"
713.900,715.800," being a bit like a tripod"
717.200,718.200," it have you"
720.200,723.400," two knees or or if you know chair to feet"
723.700,724.300," on the ground"
725.200,726.500," and then you have your seat"
727.300,729.600," making a kind of three pointed"
731.100,732.800," in a Derek kind of thing"
733.800,737.900," and and yeah your body arises Rises from"
739.000,739.800," the tripod"
741.000,742.200," with him with a three feet"
746.000,747.000," like a tripod"
750.500,752.100," and actually they would also say"
753.000,754.700," that well then be a"
755.800,757.800," two opinions on this one was the"
759.000,761.300," aim to have your spine simply upright"
762.200,763.100," rising very"
764.200,767.200," lightly and easily straight out of the seat"
769.300,769.900," like the"
771.300,773.900," the stalk of a flower growing out of the soil"
777.100,779.300," but there was another opinion"
779.700,781.200," actually another view which was"
783.600,784.400," slightly different"
784.900,786.000," imagine again that"
786.400,787.800," as this tripod"
788.700,789.500," of the seat"
790.300,791.500," and the two feet"
792.500,794.900," or perhaps the two knees if if you're sitting"
796.200,797.000," on a cushion"
798.600,799.000," and"
800.700,802.000," let yourself"
804.000,806.000," very slightly lean forward"
807.900,810.500," so that you're looking for the center of gravity"
811.700,813.400," between those three points"
815.900,819.500," so in this image you could imagine that the there's a tripod"
820.300,822.500," that has a chain hanging down from the"
823.500,826.000," the Center Point where the three legs meet"
826.700,828.800," a crux of the top of the tripod"
831.600,832.400," and where"
833.400,834.100," we're wanting to be"
835.400,835.700," kind of"
836.600,840.100," allowing gravity to align with that chain"
842.000,844.100," so you're just a bit forward"
844.800,845.600," of your seat"
850.700,852.900," that's another possibility to explore"
854.200,856.500," but this that we're looking for the same result"
856.700,857.300," which is"
859.100,860.300," that we're balanced"
861.700,863.100," and because we're balanced"
865.000,865.800," we can relax"
868.300,869.300," we can let the"
869.900,870.300," base"
871.400,872.300," become Slack"
875.000,876.600," then it just hang like a"
878.400,880.600," like a like a sheet of sail cloth"
894.800,897.400," and that learn our old friend of a JW"
899.000,899.600," sag"
901.500,902.300," be Slack"
920.500,922.300," shoulders and arms are relaxed"
925.600,926.900," and fingers"
929.400,930.800," a limb"
936.200,937.200," that throat"
938.400,941.700," get comfortable and soft and relaxed"
943.700,945.900," and let the flavour of that relaxation"
947.000,947.700," melt down"
950.600,951.700," sift down"
953.400,954.900," right through the chest and"
956.700,957.600," through the diaphragm"
961.200,962.400," all through the belly"
966.000,966.800," into the hips"
970.500,971.000," and"
972.900,974.700," the upper legs"
976.700,978.400," chords and the hands"
980.200,981.100," into the knees"
984.700,986.200," shins and carbs"
991.600,993.100," Bank calls heels"
994.800,995.800," tops of the feet"
999.100,1000.600," souls of the feet"
1003.500,1004.800," the big toes"
1005.900,1007.200," and the little toes"
1016.100,1019.000," so now having a whole picture of the body"
1020.200,1023.300," and that's include the the brows the forehead"
1024.900,1026.800," the grainy and"
1028.500,1030.600," the opposite put the back of the skull"
1031.900,1032.600," back of the neck"
1035.300,1036.700," temples ears"
1038.600,1039.700," jewel hinge"
1040.200,1040.700," hinges"
1043.000,1043.600," whole head"
1045.400,1046.100," whole body"
1061.100,1062.400," whole body awareness"
1067.900,1069.100," now letting the breath"
1071.300,1071.600," kind of"
1072.500,1073.400," blow in"
1075.400,1076.300," and flow out"
1078.400,1080.000," a brushing sweeping"
1082.400,1084.000," into this body awareness"
1085.600,1086.900," and out of it again"
1105.700,1108.000," you might start to notice some movement"
1109.000,1110.800," happening in the abdomen perhaps"
1118.900,1120.400," accompanying each breath"
1135.600,1138.900," see if you can remain with awareness of the whole body"
1145.400,1147.600," while whatever movements the breath"
1149.000,1149.400," is"
1151.100,1152.200," is causing is"
1152.600,1153.600," is a company"
1155.600,1156.500," while they go on"
1158.400,1160.400," so they happen just as they happen"
1162.700,1163.900," and we rest"
1166.400,1167.500," in whole body"
1168.000,1168.700," awareness"
1283.900,1288.000," it's a very natural that now and then thoughts will"
1288.700,1289.300," arise"
1291.200,1294.000," and if you noticed that you've been on"
1295.000,1296.400," a little thought track"
1297.800,1299.500," no problem at all just"
1301.300,1304.000," congratulate yourself on coming back to"
1304.800,1306.700," here and now and body awareness"
1310.000,1310.900," note to yourself"
1312.400,1312.800," thinking"
1313.400,1315.300," just retroactive"
1316.300,1317.300," acknowledgement that"
1318.800,1319.800," that's where we were"
1322.400,1323.000," and now we're"
1323.400,1324.500," back to this"
1335.300,1338.500," whole body awareness with breath"
1364.800,1368.300," so we might have one or two invitations"
1369.900,1371.100," in this sit"
1373.300,1376.100," things to explore one would be this"
1381.100,1381.800," as the"
1382.400,1382.800," breathe"
1384.100,1384.900," moves"
1386.600,1388.800," as it flows in and out"
1393.700,1395.800," especially in the trunk in the lower"
1396.500,1397.600," torso especially"
1400.800,1402.800," is there a subtle way that"
1404.200,1407.100," the movement of the breadth can Kindle"
1408.700,1410.900," a little bit of a tingle"
1413.300,1414.500," somewhere in the body"
1418.200,1421.200," a little bit of a kind of light energy"
1423.000,1425.400," maybe a little buzzed or tingle"
1426.500,1427.500," or warmth"
1436.200,1439.500," just an invitation to explore that lightly"
1441.000,1442.200," if you're curious"
1456.900,1459.300," don't let it affect how you breathe"
1461.000,1462.200," just let the breaths"
1462.700,1464.200," come and go by themselves"
1472.600,1475.900," and if at any time it seems hard to do that"
1476.700,1479.200," come back to the sense of the whole body"
1480.700,1482.800," the awareness of the whole body"
1484.700,1487.400," shoulders hands feet they're all included"
1493.200,1495.300," re-establish that and then"
1498.100,1500.300," letting the breath be a movement within"
1523.200,1527.500," that and then you can revisit is that any kind of subtle way"
1529.100,1531.100," that the movement of the breadth is"
1532.800,1534.600," is kind of kindling"
1534.900,1535.400," something"
1538.400,1539.700," could be very subtle"
1543.300,1545.400," a tingle about as a warmth"
1556.300,1558.700," but remembering you don't have to do anything"
1560.300,1563.000," don't do anything just be with"
1568.100,1571.700," but if find some kind of lighting go"
1572.700,1574.100," in the body field"
1575.000,1576.200," just be with it"
1576.500,1577.300," don't do anything"
1710.300,1711.300," if that"
1713.000,1717.500," invitation to explore a kindling is interesting to you"
1718.200,1719.700," keep going with it"
1721.500,1722.900," or if you're curious"
1723.300,1725.000," is another invitation"
1733.000,1734.500," can their be a sense"
1736.200,1737.700," of a wide"
1738.400,1739.200," peace"
1741.600,1742.600," providing"
1744.400,1745.400," the body field"
1749.300,1753.400," pervading the Field of awareness of the body"
1754.900,1755.900," abroad"
1757.100,1757.600," peace"
1778.800,1780.600," sometimes if that"
1780.900,1781.900," is present"
1783.000,1786.100," the breath may become rather subtle"
1789.900,1791.600," subtle and silky"
1793.000,1793.700," smooth"
1796.600,1798.100," quite shallow small"
1798.700,1799.200," breathes"
1802.600,1803.900," they do all that by themselves"
1806.400,1808.200," and don't try to make them so"
1817.100,1819.500," and if there is anything like like this"
1821.000,1822.700," again just be with it"
1823.500,1824.300," don't do anything"
1987.800,1991.600," again not not to worry at all if thoughts"
1992.200,1995.000," arise and you find you've been off somewhere else"
1996.300,1999.000," totally natural just label it"
1999.900,2000.600," thinking"
2002.000,2004.100," and you'll find you can slip right back"
2005.300,2006.400," to being right here"
2007.300,2008.300," just as you were"
2016.300,2017.200," resting"
2022.100,2022.900," doing less"
2023.900,2024.400," not more"
2032.900,2035.500," knowing that this is the time for you"
2036.900,2037.700," to be you"
2042.200,2044.500," there's not something you have to measure up"
2045.000,2045.200," to"
2046.000,2046.300," here"
2075.400,2078.600," Asian as to come back to awareness of"
2079.200,2080.100," the whole body"
2085.000,2087.700," all field of body awareness"
2091.800,2094.500," sometimes it can seem quite Broad"
2097.100,2099.500," and perhaps the boundary between"
2100.800,2103.400," body and world around us gets"
2104.100,2105.100," get blurred"
2107.300,2108.500," or perforated"
2110.900,2113.000," and we might be experiencing"
2115.300,2116.900," a sense of the body that's"
2117.300,2119.100," somehow seemed broader than"
2120.700,2121.700," kind of ought to be"
2122.700,2123.600," that's just fine"
2124.400,2125.200," if that's happening"
2131.300,2134.200," and in this breath there's in this breath"
2135.700,2136.900," there's a sense of peace"
2141.600,2142.300," acquired"
2152.900,2154.900," sometimes they're pervasive piece"
2166.200,2168.400," and they could be also have"
2170.400,2173.400," some sense of a kindling going on"
2175.900,2176.600," in the"
2177.100,2177.900," war of the"
2178.100,2178.600," body"
2180.000,2181.900," as well as a sense of peace"
2200.500,2202.100," really whatever it is"
2202.700,2203.500," be with it"
2204.400,2205.200," be with it"
2206.400,2207.600," be with it"
2208.900,2209.900," and don't do anything"
2298.800,2300.100," 10 days the last"
2300.200,2300.600," minutes"
2301.800,2302.400," a really"
2303.400,2304.400," being gentle"
2309.000,2311.400," remembering this is really just a time"
2312.800,2313.600," for yourself"
2316.300,2318.300," time to come back to yourself"
2320.200,2321.800," to be with yourself"
2334.800,2335.300," maybe"
2336.500,2338.800," kind of sleep beneath the surface"
2341.100,2341.400," into"
2342.700,2344.500," slightly deeper space"
2347.800,2348.800," a broader"
2350.100,2350.800," awareness"
2354.800,2355.500," and perhaps"
2357.400,2357.900," a deeper"
2360.700,2361.600," kind of peace"
2367.100,2368.900," even in the midst of our lives"
2379.400,2382.100," perhaps a place or space of"
2382.800,2385.000," of healing and restoration"
2397.700,2398.300," sometimes we"
2399.800,2401.300," seem to just come into"
2403.100,2404.500," a kind of presence"
2409.700,2411.100," that brings peace"
2413.200,2415.700," has piece as part of it"
2430.200,2431.800," and that's a very understanding"
2432.700,2433.000," place"
2435.200,2437.200," kind of understanding and forgiving"
2439.200,2440.500," and restorative"
2455.200,2457.300," and asks nothing of Us"
2484.400,2486.600," maybe in some way it's kind of"
2487.400,2489.000," a heart of meditation"
2503.000,2504.200," leaving aside or"
2505.100,2506.700," methods and schemes and"
2508.300,2509.800," tools and techniques"
2521.800,2523.800," as coming into a place of"
2525.300,2526.600," rest and ease"
2530.200,2530.500," and"
2532.800,2534.600," the soulful"
2535.700,2536.600," restoration"
2601.000,2602.200," I'm going to"
2603.200,2605.400," in an invite you just to keep going"
2607.200,2608.100," if that's"
2609.700,2612.800," feeling like the most compassionate thing for you to do"
2614.400,2615.600," and we will have a"
2617.100,2619.600," little pause and really"
2619.900,2621.100," convene"
2622.000,2624.900," in seven minutes at 50 minutes past the hour"
2625.800,2629.600," and if it's seems more compassionate to go and get a cup of tea or coffee"
2631.300,2633.800," or whatever drink a water then do that"
2634.700,2636.000," thank you all very much"

3046.600,3048.100," in the novels I've been reading"
3049.800,3052.500," these naval novels of Patrick O'Brien"
3053.400,3053.600," and"
3054.500,3055.500," had a kind of journey"
3055.800,3057.200," asked Mother's Day in the UK"
3057.800,3058.400," wow thanks for the"
3059.400,3060.600," thanks for the reminder Todd"
3061.000,3062.400," with it's not here it's"
3063.100,3065.200," we have a different schedule for Mother's Day"
3066.000,3066.600," that's good to know"
3067.700,3068.600," okay so"
3070.400,3072.000," let's see what um"
3074.000,3078.000," ah a few things I really want to try to share with you but I'm"
3078.400,3080.700," going to just I want to put out the caveat"
3081.100,3081.700," again that"
3082.400,3082.800," you know my"
3084.000,3089.100," ordinarily unclear brain is even less clear today with these swirlz of"
3089.900,3090.500," of delicious"
3091.300,3092.300," weird juniper"
3093.100,3096.000," doing it's magic so I just don't know how clearly I'm going to"
3097.000,3097.200," sort of"
3099.800,3100.400," a sort of"
3100.900,3103.000," take us on a clear journey today or not"
3103.300,3105.300," so maybe think of better to think of it instead of"
3105.400,3107.000," impressionist painting or something"
3107.500,3108.900," hint of this hints of that"
3109.400,3112.400," and just you know let it in some way hopefully"
3113.300,3115.100," provides some kind of a"
3115.900,3117.500," encouragement for your practice that's"
3117.900,3119.500," that's really the the big hope"
3122.600,3125.000," first of all just on the subject of breath"
3128.400,3129.900," and also the heart"
3130.500,3130.900," area"
3131.300,3133.200," closely linked to it you know"
3133.800,3137.200," it has been the some research that suggests that"
3137.900,3140.200," maybe something like as many as 10%"
3141.300,3143.100," of people who come to meditation"
3144.100,3146.900," don't find breath practice easy"
3147.500,3148.100," when they start"
3148.600,3150.800," and maybe even a higher number than that"
3153.900,3154.200," one"
3156.600,3158.400," view on that is that"
3160.900,3166.200," breath practice is very kind of intimate it's alright in the middle of us I mean especially if we do"
3167.300,3168.000," torso"
3168.300,3170.100," baste breath practice whether"
3170.800,3173.000," sensing it in the belly which is common in"
3173.700,3174.600," certain traditions"
3175.900,3180.900," or in the diaphragm area which is kind of between the chest and the belly the"
3182.500,3186.100," but either way it's awfully close to the heart area"
3187.000,3187.700," which is where"
3188.100,3189.500," we have our"
3190.100,3191.300," the heart of our"
3191.800,3194.200," sensations of emotion"
3194.700,3196.000," happen as We Know"
3196.700,3200.200," in the third chest and diaphragm and sometimes belly this is where"
3200.800,3201.000," the"
3201.700,3203.000," sense sensory"
3203.900,3204.200," or"
3204.800,3206.600," body Sensation side"
3207.400,3208.600," of emotional experience"
3209.100,3209.700," shows up"
3210.600,3213.400," the other side of it of course is cognitive"
3214.300,3216.300," you know talk in the mind images in the mind"
3217.300,3219.700," we can have talked and images in the mind"
3220.200,3222.800," without much emotions Sensation by the way"
3223.400,3224.300," possibly with none"
3225.200,3225.300," but"
3225.800,3226.700," it's very Common"
3227.200,3227.300," to"
3228.500,3228.800," have"
3230.000,3231.500," emotions Sensation"
3232.000,3232.900," and thought"
3233.500,3234.400," braided together"
3236.700,3240.000," so if we're asked to do breath practice which so many"
3240.700,3242.200," meditation"
3243.000,3244.700," programmes begin"
3245.500,3247.700," just as a matter of course often just"
3248.100,3249.500," well folly of breath you know"
3250.100,3254.500," like what else you know it's such a sort of obvious go to for meditation"
3255.900,3260.000," partly because we're being still and it's the one thing moving"
3260.600,3261.200," partly because"
3262.100,3267.100," breath is slightly subtle but not very subtle it's so it's a"
3267.500,3269.900," fairly easy thing to use as an anchor"
3270.400,3271.900," and of course it's always here"
3272.500,3273.800," so if we can learn to"
3274.500,3276.300," develop a familiarity with the breadth"
3276.900,3278.400," while meditating"
3279.000,3281.500," it can become an e and easy go to"
3282.200,3285.500," when we're in the midst of life and activities of interactions"
3286.200,3286.600," so it can be really"
3287.300,3287.600," if we've"
3288.000,3289.800," developed some Association"
3290.100,3292.500," with the breadth as a kind of friendly"
3293.500,3295.600," calming place to go"
3296.400,3298.500," that can be tremendously useful when we're"
3299.000,3300.700," out on the high seas of life"
3301.300,3304.300," you know and and need a click hit of centering"
3304.800,3305.500," come to the breath"
3305.900,3306.500," Center us"
3306.800,3308.600," in it says it's you can see why"
3309.100,3310.900," it would be a popular go-to for"
3311.400,3312.900," meditation over the millennia"
3314.200,3315.800," but the but the issue with it"
3316.200,3321.900," and this is I mean this is I think a sort of a little bit of combination of my take on it plus"
3322.300,3323.700," plus or a little"
3324.700,3325.500," tweak on"
3326.000,3328.700," the my own tweak on it based on what other"
3329.200,3330.000," people say about it"
3330.400,3332.100," so it's not very original for me at all"
3332.600,3332.700," but"
3333.500,3334.100," it's that you know"
3334.800,3335.800," because the breath"
3336.200,3339.300," is is right here in the middle of the core of the body"
3341.800,3344.500," it is it is right where"
3344.900,3345.700," the emotion"
3346.700,3347.000," energy"
3347.800,3348.800," Center is"
3349.800,3351.300," shorthand heart you know"
3351.700,3352.300," but on a quote"
3352.700,3354.800," emotion energy center"
3356.000,3356.600," so the breathe"
3357.200,3361.100," is very lightly going to bring us to awareness of that"
3362.000,3362.200," now"
3363.100,3363.700," sometimes"
3365.200,3366.400," you know we could be"
3368.000,3372.100," don't want to say this in politely but emotionally illiterate"
3372.700,3375.400," which I was when I started meditating I really"
3376.200,3378.300," had very little understanding of"
3378.800,3379.400," emotion"
3380.200,3380.900," and being quite"
3381.700,3381.900," you know"
3382.500,3384.600," troubled and tormented in buying"
3385.200,3386.500," and quite unhappy"
3387.200,3387.500," and"
3389.300,3389.900," or even"
3390.300,3391.000," perhaps sort of"
3391.300,3394.200," exacerbated by the fact that I was so illiterate"
3394.900,3395.900," immersively I mean"
3396.800,3399.500," you know it was a journey it"
3400.700,3401.700," began for me"
3402.400,3404.900," a soup as soon after I started meditating"
3405.700,3407.800," when I found there was this really uncomfortable"
3408.300,3409.100," Sensation"
3409.600,3410.900," in my chest area"
3412.900,3414.300," which I was not previously"
3415.800,3416.500," aware of"
3417.400,3419.000," though it has certainly been"
3420.600,3420.700," that so"
3421.200,3424.700," once I started meditating and the Beginning practice was breath"
3425.800,3426.500," this"
3427.900,3428.300," yeah"
3428.600,3429.300," yucky feeling"
3430.000,3430.700," in my chest"
3432.100,3433.000," showed us off"
3434.000,3434.300," and"
3435.300,3437.100," it was uncomfortable enough that"
3437.800,3439.400," I didn't want to keep meditating"
3440.400,3443.900," but actually I did I went and got some guidance on it"
3444.500,3447.700," and was helped and just carried on in a slightly different way"
3448.500,3450.200," and and then at some point"
3451.000,3452.400," thereafter started therapy"
3453.000,3457.100," which began a journey of starting to get a bit more emotionally"
3457.800,3458.600," literate"
3459.000,3459.700," and get a sort of"
3460.400,3462.500," little bit of psychology 101"
3463.100,3463.500," which was"
3464.000,3464.200," very"
3465.200,3466.100," needed and helpful"
3467.200,3467.300," but"
3469.100,3469.600," the breath"
3470.000,3470.600," therefore"
3471.900,3472.500," is gonna be"
3473.200,3474.400," can be maybe"
3474.900,3475.800," likely will be"
3476.500,3477.100," I kind of"
3477.400,3478.100," shortcut"
3478.800,3479.100," to"
3481.000,3482.000," the experience of"
3482.600,3485.500," that's going on in the heart area that's to say"
3486.000,3487.500," the emotion energy center"
3488.200,3489.400," in the middle of the torso"
3490.600,3492.400," or some says basically chest"
3493.800,3496.500," some say can be broader through the torso"
3498.800,3499.700," ding ding ding okay so"
3501.000,3501.600," therefore"
3502.300,3503.800," if we're going to talk about"
3504.500,3504.900," breathe"
3506.100,3506.600," awareness"
3507.600,3511.800," this we probably ought to expand the topic"
3512.700,3512.800," to"
3514.500,3514.600," some"
3515.800,3517.300," discussion of this"
3517.900,3519.300," feeling Center the heart"
3519.800,3520.200," area"
3523.100,3523.900," and that's"
3524.500,3525.300," got to be a good thing"
3526.300,3527.400," because you know we"
3528.500,3529.500," we kind of"
3530.900,3532.100," are"
3534.100,3537.700," Julian life you know our peace and our joy and our"
3538.200,3539.000," openness"
3540.000,3542.800," is actually very much determined by what's going on"
3543.600,3544.100," in here"
3545.500,3546.100," heart area"
3547.300,3548.000," so let me just"
3549.200,3549.600," I want to"
3550.200,3552.500," I want to now kind of come at this in a few"
3553.200,3553.800," ways"
3554.500,3555.600," the first is to tell you"
3556.700,3559.900," a couple of little anecdotes recent anecdotes from my own life"
3561.300,3562.900," that touch on this one was"
3563.700,3566.300," I was really lucky actually that an old friend"
3567.500,3568.900," who's a being a very"
3570.200,3574.100," new and from the age of 13 14 15 back then"
3574.800,3578.000," and even back then he was a musician he was a guitar player"
3578.300,3579.800," and he was a very very good"
3580.500,3582.500," kind of Young guitar player you know sort of"
3583.200,3587.000," course a number of us back and that kind of age"
3587.600,3589.900," had a chance to sort of learn to strum a little bit"
3590.500,3594.800," he was his called Justine he was he was way better already than than those"
3595.400,3595.500," you know"
3596.800,3598.100," clumsy strummers in a"
3598.800,3599.800," but some of us were"
3600.300,3603.100," and and he went on to have a career in music"
3603.700,3608.000," and and there's actually had a had a very very good career"
3608.400,3609.300," as a guitarist"
3610.400,3614.900," and he was coming to Santa Fe with he came on a US tour"
3615.600,3617.200," recently played in Santa Fe"
3618.200,3618.400," and"
3619.400,3621.900," gave an absolutely marvellous concert"
3622.600,3623.100," in a little"
3623.700,3627.000," ancient Chapel here called the San Miguel Chapel"
3627.600,3628.000," built in"
3629.100,3633.100," I forget now maybe 16 10 or something really really early"
3633.500,3634.700," for for America"
3636.100,3636.200," for"
3637.300,3638.900," colonial America you know"
3640.500,3643.800," and there's a beautiful little chapel and he plays with a"
3644.200,3647.400," the moment with his baby lots of different people but right now is playing with"
3648.300,3650.700," a guy from Southern Italy called mauro"
3651.500,3654.700," he's called Justin Adams by the way if anyone's curious-- and"
3655.300,3658.200," his companion at the moment in music is"
3658.800,3659.500," mauro"
3661.000,3662.400," daratso I think from"
3663.100,3664.300," way down in the"
3664.800,3666.700," heel of the boot of Italy"
3668.200,3670.800," kind of Wild Place actually in this guy"
3671.800,3675.100," he plays violin and Tambourine or tamborella"
3675.300,3677.800," brilliantly I mean it played the Tambourine like a"
3678.500,3681.900," like the most sophisticated musical instrument nothing like"
3682.400,3684.700," the little thing we used to shake and Primary School you know"
3685.000,3686.500," very very remarkable"
3687.100,3688.800," and also plays the violin this guy"
3689.400,3693.200," and the two of them together and they also sing a bit and the two of them together"
3693.700,3698.000," create this incredibly sort of rich sonorities and very very moving songs"
3698.700,3700.500," and and it was remarkable how"
3703.600,3707.100," they I really didn't know what to expect actually I was I wasn't"
3707.500,3710.100," totally sort of sure I was going to enjoy it whenever it was"
3710.800,3714.400," and it was mind-blowing and the whole the whole Chappell"
3714.900,3716.100," you could feel was just"
3717.200,3722.300," absolutely infused by this sort of single entity very deep and"
3722.800,3726.600," almost had a sort of sacred feel to it although you wouldn't have thoughts that just from"
3727.200,3728.200," the way they played it was"
3728.700,3729.100," driving"
3729.700,3730.800," driving rhythms and"
3731.800,3734.300," and with the sort of little bit of a sense of the"
3735.900,3740.000," archaic Mediterranean wreck classical Mediterranean the wild"
3740.700,3742.900," you know Mediterranean sort of"
3743.500,3746.600," earthy australis culture coming through and"
3747.800,3748.600," very powerful"
3749.000,3750.400," and just in doing this"
3750.700,3752.900," incredible riffs on his electric guitar"
3753.600,3756.300," and amazing sound with this is a"
3756.600,3757.600," pedals you know"
3758.600,3762.900," adjust the sound of the guitar so it's brilliant brilliant rhythms just amazing and"
3763.600,3765.500," the whole the whole the whole room was just"
3767.200,3768.900," filled with this sense of"
3769.900,3774.900," a deep kind of presence you know and it was very moving at times everybody was"
3776.000,3778.900," eyes were feeling with tears a certain points you know and"
3779.400,3782.500," with just the sheer beauty of what they were producing and"
3783.400,3790.900," and later actually and then I got to hang out with just in a bit you know we haven't seen each other in ages and Asia it was very very nice of course to"
3791.400,3793.300," reconnect with somebody that you've actually"
3793.900,3798.500," even not a very close friendship but you've got this long stretch of time you've seen"
3799.300,3802.200," the Ark of the own life a little bit more"
3802.900,3804.300," and you can see the arcs of"
3805.300,3806.300," Friends lives and"
3806.900,3809.400," it was a so it's very meaningful sort of reconnection"
3810.700,3817.900," but actually what I want to what I want to particularly get to is just hearing just in talk about what it was like to play"
3818.800,3819.800," when a concert"
3820.400,3823.900," is going to another level when it hits another dimension"
3824.300,3826.600," which it did that night you know and he really"
3827.500,3828.900," he said it's like"
3831.700,3835.100," he's got this guitar in his hands it has strings"
3836.100,3837.200," and the sound box"
3839.000,3841.100," and I heard him once talking about this actually"
3841.600,3843.800," he talked a little bit about it with me when we're there but"
3844.100,3846.100," what I'm going to quote now is from another"
3846.400,3847.700," interview I heard him once give"
3848.200,3852.600," where he has been playing in the Albert Hall which is played in many times this big great"
3853.000,3855.500," iconic concert hall in the middle of London you know"
3856.100,3857.400," huge place Victorian"
3858.300,3858.500," and"
3860.700,3866.600," big brick monster in a great big concept as well these famous concerts called the Proms"
3867.500,3868.800," happen every summer in London"
3869.400,3870.500," and he said you know"
3871.100,3873.900," one time he he was he he started a song"
3875.100,3877.200," it's just playing this spare"
3877.600,3878.800," chords on his guitar"
3879.700,3879.900," and"
3880.900,3884.400," and actually it was with the famous singer Sinead O'Connor at that time"
3885.200,3888.900," and you know who died recently fairly recently and"
3889.800,3893.000," and he he is laying down his simple chords and"
3893.700,3897.400," everybody knows she is going to start singing with this"
3899.500,3899.800," kind of"
3900.100,3902.600," ethereal voice she has"
3903.800,3904.800," a serial voice"
3905.700,3907.200," and everybody's waiting"
3907.600,3908.600," for her to start singing"
3909.400,3911.400," and he's playing his his simple"
3912.200,3913.100," chords and notes"
3913.700,3914.800," beautifully on his guitar"
3915.400,3916.400," and he said it was like"
3917.600,3919.500," it was like the sound box"
3930.700,3932.900," like the sound box of his guitar"
3945.800,3946.700," sorry excuse me"
3947.200,3947.700," became"
3948.300,3948.700," the hole"
3949.100,3949.800," album Hall"
3954.900,3957.300," I don't know why that guessed to me so much but I feel it"
3958.200,3960.800," I've known experiences like that where we"
3973.700,3974.600,"excuse me"
3975.100,3976.200," we're having our own"
3976.800,3979.800," little human experience whatever it may be"
3980.900,3981.700," and somehow"
3984.800,3985.900," who really knows"
3987.200,3988.700," how oh why"
3990.600,3991.300," but somehow"
3991.900,3993.600," our own little experience"
3994.200,3994.700," becomes"
3996.200,3997.100," becomes everything"
3998.900,3999.700," we discover"
4000.200,4001.200," that it's been"
4002.300,4004.000," so much more than we thought"
4005.300,4005.800," all along"
4008.000,4008.700," and that we're not"
4009.200,4009.800," separate"
4012.000,4013.300," we're just not"
4014.000,4014.400," separ"
4029.100,4032.900," it's really easy to talk about this in a"
4034.000,4037.200," I've done it myself endlessly in a in a rather"
4038.800,4041.200," matter of fact and almost glib way"
4041.900,4042.300," oh yeah"
4043.300,4044.900," we're part of everything oh yeah"
4045.600,4047.200," everything's one oh yeah"
4047.700,4049.300," on some level everything's empty"
4051.700,4052.200," but actually"
4053.800,4054.600," any time"
4056.000,4058.100," we we actually experience"
4058.900,4059.900," any of those things"
4062.900,4065.100," it's a it's a life-changing thing"
4067.300,4068.500," it's not a little thing"
4070.700,4071.000," to just"
4072.100,4072.900," think we know about"
4077.100,4079.500," it's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's"
4080.200,4082.400," it's a totally transformative thing"
4083.900,4086.000," that's it it shatters"
4087.400,4087.800," are"
4089.000,4091.200," ordinary view now ordinary"
4091.900,4094.600," that horizontal view I was talking about earlier"
4095.500,4095.900," it just"
4097.300,4099.600," it just takes it like a sheet of paper"
4100.500,4102.900," and scrump it up into a little ball"
4103.500,4104.700," and throws it away"
4106.700,4107.700," and are"
4108.300,4111.600," our view our understanding our experience"
4112.200,4113.800," of what of what this"
4114.600,4115.100," very"
4115.500,4115.900," moment"
4116.700,4117.100," is"
4119.200,4120.400," changes utterly"
4124.000,4125.100," and and we are"
4127.500,4128.100," we are"
4130.100,4130.700," part of everything"
4132.600,4133.000," we are"
4133.500,4134.300," part of everything"
4139.900,4141.500," and frankly honestly"
4142.000,4143.100," it makes everything different"
4145.500,4146.700," it makes everything different"
4148.600,4149.300," to see that"
4158.300,4158.500," and"
4159.100,4159.300," so"
4159.900,4161.500," yeah so actually"
4162.000,4163.100," there's another way"
4164.600,4165.300," or maybe I shouldn't"
4165.800,4168.800," rush on that's just take that in a bit perhaps"
4169.400,4171.600," let's just actually let's just sit let's just sit"
4172.400,4174.000," quietly for a moment and just"
4182.700,4183.700,"just be with this"
4261.200,4262.200," yeah um"
4264.400,4264.800," so"
4265.300,4267.200," so here's here's the other"
4268.200,4270.000," point I wanted to share is about"
4272.900,4273.200," you know"
4275.000,4278.500," Justin talking about the sound box of his instrument"
4281.600,4282.000," becoming"
4283.400,4285.400," as if it became the whole album Hall"
4289.900,4291.000," you know and it"
4291.600,4294.100," some of you will have heard me talk before about the"
4295.900,4298.800," this this heart area this feeling center"
4299.500,4301.100," well I've got a poem where I like it"
4301.800,4303.000," to a wine skin"
4303.700,4304.900," you know wine skin being"
4305.700,4308.000," the the older"
4309.000,4309.400," ancient"
4309.900,4312.900," storage of wine in the Mediterranean"
4314.100,4315.800," Hull all around the Mediterranean"
4316.500,4317.500," and the Middle East"
4317.900,4321.200," the wine skin goatskin wine skin"
4321.800,4325.200," whether three homework three dating Homer with how"
4325.600,4326.700," wine was stored"
4327.900,4330.600," and actually I'm going to read it this little poem"
4331.200,4334.100," because some of you won't won't have heard it in some of you will have done but"
4334.600,4335.800," may well have forgotten"
4337.100,4337.300," and"
4338.900,4340.600," it's simply likening this"
4341.100,4342.600," wine skin sorry"
4343.100,4346.100," this heart area to a wine Skin So imagine"
4347.000,4348.000," some older you know"
4348.800,4352.600," peasant huts somewhere in Greece or Creed or"
4353.300,4355.200," Lebanon or"
4356.100,4357.900," Italy Southern Italy"
4359.000,4359.600," and there's a"
4360.000,4362.600," that have wine skins hanging from the Rafters you know"
4363.800,4366.300," and so imagine one of those is hanging"
4367.200,4368.000," inside you"
4369.800,4370.000," this"
4371.400,4373.000," God and patched up"
4373.400,4375.200," Old Wine skin"
4375.800,4376.500," of a heart"
4377.800,4378.900," what a thing it is"
4380.900,4381.200," still"
4381.600,4382.500," doing service"
4383.600,4385.800," till sometimes brimming"
4387.900,4390.700," and other times so dry and stiff"
4391.500,4392.400," it creaks"
4393.200,4394.000," with every breath"
4395.600,4397.500," sometimes when it aches"
4399.200,4400.500," it takes me back"
4401.300,4403.200," to rainy days in childhood"
4404.300,4405.800," to the big window"
4406.900,4408.800," filled with Grace Sky"
4409.700,4412.400," where we watched raindrops"
4413.000,4414.000," racing each other"
4414.600,4415.700," over the green world"
4416.400,4417.000," outside"
4418.800,4420.200," so sometimes when"
4421.100,4424.200," this Old Wine skin of a heart is aching"
4425.600,4428.400," it takes me back to rainy days in childhood"
4429.400,4433.600," by the big window of filled with Grace Guy where we watched"
4434.300,4436.000," raindrops race each other"
4436.700,4437.900," over the green world"
4438.600,4439.100," outside"
4440.200,4441.500," that was where"
4442.000,4443.200," I first learned"
4444.100,4446.100," to let the days mood"
4446.800,4448.100," and my mood"
4448.700,4449.700," be of one Accord"
4451.200,4452.900," that was where I first learned"
4453.900,4455.900," to let the days mood"
4456.400,4457.600," and my mood"
4458.300,4459.300," be of one Accord"
4461.600,4464.400," kind of finding a way to be in sync"
4465.300,4466.300," with the world around me"
4467.500,4469.500," somehow I could sort of learn that"
4470.300,4470.500," as a"
4471.800,4473.100," innocent boy you know"
4473.700,4475.300," and I have to admit I forgot it"
4477.000,4478.300," anyway the poem goes on"
4479.000,4479.800," soon enough"
4480.100,4481.600," this old sack"
4482.200,4483.400," moissons again"
4484.200,4485.900," with a secret view"
4486.400,4488.500," that it draws out of the very air"
4489.700,4491.900," so no matter how dry it can get"
4492.400,4494.700," soon or later- it will moisten again"
4496.700,4497.900," and it fills again"
4498.900,4500.400," when its own vintage"
4501.700,4505.100," from the sun and slopes of some unknown"
4505.500,4506.100," Ana"
4508.300,4510.300," kanna being a place somewhere in"
4511.700,4513.800," Israel Palestine Syria I'm not sure"
4514.900,4518.300," where there was the famous incident at the wedding feast when"
4519.000,4521.400," Jesus turned water into wine"
4521.800,4523.300," is one of his famous miracles"
4524.100,4526.200," so sooner or later this Old Wine skin"
4526.900,4529.300," no matter how dry will fill again with its"
4530.100,4531.100," secret vintage"
4532.100,4534.500," from the sun and slopes of an unknown Cana"
4535.000,4538.300," till the very scenes are seeping"
4540.000,4540.700," and I drink"
4541.800,4543.300," and I forget who I am"
4544.200,4545.300," and I'm astonished"
4546.100,4548.500," and the Old skin bursts"
4549.100,4551.600," and irrigates the whole world"
4552.300,4555.400," and all the arid Creek beds of the Earth"
4556.100,4557.000," run again"
4558.100,4561.600," every thirsty feel drinks it's Phil"
4565.300,4566.400," what a bag of tricks"
4567.600,4568.600," still teaching me"
4569.000,4569.500," what it is"
4570.100,4571.000," and what it can do"
4574.500,4577.600," so even when it's been dry it will moisten again"
4578.200,4579.100," and it will fill"
4579.900,4581.400," with his own vintage"
4582.700,4583.100," from some"
4584.000,4586.700," from the sun and slopes of an unknown Cana"
4587.200,4589.300," till it's very seems a seeping"
4590.000,4590.600," and I drink"
4591.600,4591.700," and"
4592.800,4594.300," I forget who I am"
4594.700,4595.700," am and I'm astonished"
4596.300,4598.400," and the Old Wine skin bursts"
4599.000,4599.200," and all"
4600.200,4602.200," the arid Creek beds of the Earth"
4602.600,4603.300," run again"
4604.100,4608.500," and it irrigates the whole world in every thirsty field drinks is fill"
4609.200,4610.600," what a bag of tricks"
4611.400,4612.800," still teaching me what it is"
4613.400,4614.200," and what it can do"
4617.000,4617.300," this is"
4618.800,4623.300," I don't know whether this is kind of making any sense but this this poem is is what"
4623.900,4628.000," is what the Old zen is used to say"
4628.700,4629.800," that got it right"
4630.400,4631.100," they talked about"
4632.200,4636.600," they always said sort of Zen is a practice at the heart is all about looking at the heart"
4637.100,4640.100," and the word for heart that they had was shin"
4640.600,4641.900," and shin means"
4643.000,4648.300," it's actually sadly often translated as mine because it means both heart and mind it means this"
4649.100,4651.300," collective system of who we feel we are"
4652.200,4652.700," inwardly"
4653.300,4656.800," it's means rather like this wine skin I'm talking about actually"
4657.300,4659.200," mood emotion affect"
4659.800,4660.300," feeling"
4660.800,4661.500," you know and"
4662.500,4665.200," and and and and and including not excluding"
4665.700,4668.800," thought and the cognitive stuff in a single system"
4669.400,4670.400," this wine skin"
4672.500,4676.100," is exactly what we need to study zen said"
4676.700,4677.900," if you study it"
4678.600,4679.600," if we study it"
4680.400,4681.400," then we can find"
4682.100,4682.800," that actually"
4683.500,4683.700," it"
4684.100,4685.000," does burst"
4685.600,4687.600," it does rip over and it seemed"
4688.000,4689.600," because actually what we are"
4690.300,4694.600," What We most feel ourselves to be exactly this that we sent within us"
4695.000,4695.700," who we are"
4696.400,4696.900," actually"
4697.700,4698.800," on closer inspection"
4700.200,4701.600," it it somehow"
4702.700,4703.500," includes everything"
4704.600,4705.100," it's somehow"
4705.600,4707.100," is the whole world"
4708.700,4709.700," I know nobody can"
4711.500,4714.800," we're making attempts I think now to understand how and why that can be"
4715.300,4716.800," in science and other areas"
4717.400,4717.500," but"
4718.000,4720.800," above all it's if we experience it for ourselves"
4721.800,4723.300," what are healing it is"
4724.200,4727.600," what a wondrous chef it is"
4728.400,4731.200," and what a different light it reveals about"
4732.000,4733.200," what our human life is"
4734.100,4737.400," and you know then is devoted to helping our do that"
4737.700,4739.000," at least in some traditions"
4740.000,4740.100," and"
4741.800,4744.700," so is a Buddhism so is what"
4745.300,4745.900," shaqi money"
4746.400,4749.700," and called the the Royal Road of Awakening"
4750.200,4750.700," the breath"
4751.200,4754.200," the breath is the Royal Road to Awakening"
4754.600,4755.000," he said"
4756.900,4760.400," perhaps because breath takes us right into this heart area"
4761.000,4761.800," boom where"
4762.400,4764.500," we might make this Discovery"
4764.900,4767.800," but even if we don't it's it's so good to be"
4768.300,4771.000," tending and cherishing and saving and loving"
4771.500,4772.500," this heart area"
4772.900,4773.600," it's funny this"
4774.000,4775.500," the heart his actually"
4776.000,4777.500," there's something else I really want to say about this"
4778.000,4779.000," but I don't want to get off track"
4780.200,4780.800," it's so"
4787.300,4788.100," it seems to me like"
4788.800,4789.400," how we"
4790.700,4793.300," deal with this heart area is"
4793.900,4795.000," is everything really because"
4797.400,4799.300," then we just unpack that thought because"
4801.100,4801.600," first of all"
4803.300,4804.300," some of us are just"
4805.200,4808.200," kind of a emotional idiots like me you know I really"
4808.700,4811.000," had no idea kind of what emotion was"
4812.100,4812.900," even though I had been"
4813.500,4813.700," yeah"
4814.600,4817.000," so sort of in a sense plagued by it through much of my childhood"
4819.000,4824.700," and how important it was to start to be to to understand it to get versed in"
4827.000,4830.100," the emotional life of a human being to understand it better"
4831.000,4833.600," and and then through that to start"
4834.900,4835.600," you know"
4836.100,4836.600," actually"
4839.600,4840.100," help"
4840.700,4841.200," myself"
4841.800,4844.600," with some of the difficult emotions that I had kind of"
4846.200,4849.300," tried to lock down so that I wouldn't have to live with them"
4850.100,4851.300," but the process of"
4851.900,4856.300," growing in the kinds of ways that would allow me to feel what I was feeling"
4857.200,4859.300," and then I actually had those feelings change"
4860.000,4861.300," you know and and and and and and and"
4861.900,4865.000," and and and be able to handle them in or be able to be with them and"
4865.500,4867.300," in very different ways and that was all"
4868.000,4868.600," a great"
4869.400,4870.200," a great journey"
4870.600,4872.300," and long going to Journey of growth"
4875.400,4876.900," but there's something about"
4879.400,4882.700," about this in a system if we can call it that"
4883.400,4885.900," that is just fascinating really"
4886.700,4887.800," what actually is it"
4888.400,4892.200," and how does it do what it does and how did it make the feelings"
4892.700,4894.100," you know if you get interested in it"
4895.100,4896.000," it's fascinating"
4897.600,4897.700," and"
4898.900,4901.100," here's where I want to just circle back to"
4901.800,4902.400," again"
4902.900,4904.400," my guitarist friend Justin and"
4904.900,4906.700," talking about that Albert Hall moment"
4907.200,4908.300," here's the thing the"
4908.800,4908.900," the"
4911.800,4912.700," this this"
4913.900,4915.100," yeah in a system"
4915.600,4916.400," of thought and feeling"
4917.000,4917.300," okay"
4918.100,4920.000," I have talked about it as a wine skip"
4921.000,4923.100," but here's another way to think about it"
4924.200,4925.200," a stringed instrument"
4926.400,4926.900," it has"
4928.200,4930.900," several strings and it has a sound box"
4931.500,4934.800," and we could almost say that the strings are equivalent to the"
4937.400,4938.000," cognitive"
4938.400,4938.900," elements"
4939.800,4940.600," the various kinds of"
4941.100,4942.100," thought that we have"
4942.900,4943.400," you know the"
4944.300,4947.000," different strands of thinking that a common"
4947.300,4947.800," for us"
4949.000,4954.200," and of course some of them arrive in talk form in the mind some of them arrived at image form"
4954.900,4957.600," whatever they are those let's say those are the strings and then"
4958.200,4959.800," this this feeling"
4960.700,4964.600," energy center in the body we could call that that's the sound box"
4965.500,4967.000," that's where the resonance happen"
4967.800,4970.200," so we get the thoughts happening ting ting ting"
4971.000,4972.800," and the resonance happens here"
4973.400,4974.300," like the sound box"
4975.300,4975.900," that's probably a"
4976.600,4977.900," actually a more and more"
4978.900,4980.400," tidy analogy"
4980.800,4982.700," and no accurate analogy may be"
4983.200,4983.700," than my"
4984.200,4986.000," loose wine skin you know"
4987.200,4987.300," and"
4987.900,4988.500," it's like"
4989.100,4991.000," sometimes you'll get to see this"
4991.900,4993.800," if in in meditation"
4994.200,4995.400," and I remember times when"
4997.900,5000.300," when this happened for me I was just you know Sitting"
5001.700,5003.300," quietly and still and quite"
5003.900,5006.600," concentrated quite focused quite aware"
5007.600,5009.100," quite a present you know"
5009.600,5010.500," in meditation then"
5011.400,5013.200," suddenly I realised oh yeah there's a"
5014.200,5014.700," there's this"
5015.800,5017.400," Strand like a string"
5018.700,5019.200," ringing"
5020.200,5022.900," it's an emotion associated with a thought and"
5023.900,5026.000," and there's another one over here ringing"
5026.600,5026.800," and"
5027.300,5028.200," instead of being"
5029.000,5029.300," sort of"
5029.900,5033.900," you know oh no not not feeling something yucky again kind of thing"
5034.600,5036.600," we can get to a place where we're just fascinated"
5037.400,5039.000," it's amazing that this"
5041.300,5043.500," this kind of experience can happen"
5044.600,5046.900," for us it's extraordinary and we can"
5047.600,5050.400," we can it's amazing also that we can look at it"
5051.100,5054.000," and we can kind of analyse it and"
5054.900,5056.000," see oh yeah"
5056.500,5058.200," we can get quite specific about it"
5058.700,5061.300," there's one Strand here that feels like this"
5062.700,5064.700," there's another Strand here that feels like this"
5065.600,5069.800," and sometimes there's another one and that one's playing no this one's playing"
5070.400,5071.700," and now that one's playing"
5072.200,5073.900," you know you can you can become"
5074.900,5075.500," a real"
5080.100,5083.900," word do I want like a real student"
5084.700,5085.400," of your own"
5088.300,5089.000," heart you can become a"
5090.900,5091.500," yeah"
5091.900,5093.400," I think that's the right way to put it actually"
5094.000,5096.100," you can really start to study"
5097.200,5098.600," what it is"
5102.100,5102.400," hmm"
5104.500,5105.800," what is that actually happening"
5106.700,5107.300," you know when"
5108.300,5108.400," we"
5109.100,5109.800," get thought"
5110.600,5111.300," when we get"
5112.000,5112.300," feeling"
5113.500,5114.700," I'm in another time I remember"
5115.600,5118.000," I was I've been meditating a lot and I was just"
5118.900,5121.000," lying in bed one night before going to sleep"
5122.000,5125.700," having some thought and I can't remember what it was but I remember that it was"
5126.400,5129.500," a little video you know there was a there was some kind of image"
5130.200,5133.700," and some audio there's some speech going on with it"
5134.300,5134.800," and I"
5135.500,5136.200," I was sort of"
5137.800,5138.600," aware enough"
5140.000,5140.300," to"
5141.400,5142.100," notice"
5142.600,5143.200," that I was"
5143.800,5144.400," noticing it"
5145.300,5146.500," in other words I could see"
5148.000,5148.700," wow"
5149.600,5151.200," I am watching"
5152.000,5152.300," this"
5153.900,5154.700," scenario"
5155.900,5157.200," on a little stage"
5158.200,5158.900," as it were"
5159.600,5161.100," in my own mind"
5162.800,5162.900," and"
5163.900,5164.300," it was"
5164.700,5167.800," you know it was just it just struck me"
5169.200,5170.500," then you know as"
5171.100,5172.000," an utterly"
5173.600,5174.100," remarkable"
5175.200,5175.700," thing"
5176.700,5176.800," that"
5177.700,5179.100," that could be this"
5180.000,5182.300," little stage set in my mind"
5183.700,5185.800," so convincingly playing"
5186.700,5187.300," a scenario"
5188.200,5190.300," you know people I can't remember what it was now but"
5190.700,5192.600," I remember realising that it was"
5193.300,5194.100," it was just"
5194.500,5196.800," almost as real as the real world you know"
5197.600,5199.800," this imagined little scenario"
5200.500,5201.900," and I could sit there"
5202.600,5204.700," watching it in Trance by it"
5205.100,5207.200," not only that I could be aware"
5208.400,5208.800," of"
5209.000,5209.800," a part of me"
5210.500,5213.800," gazing at this screen and then I could be aware of that watcher"
5214.300,5215.600," and of the stage set"
5216.500,5216.900," and that"
5217.500,5218.700," that both arising"
5219.300,5220.900," within this mind"
5221.700,5223.000," and it's just"
5224.700,5225.300," utterly"
5226.300,5227.600," amazing how does that"
5228.100,5228.200," happen"
5229.000,5230.200," it was so beautiful"
5231.100,5232.300," but that could happen"
5233.200,5233.900," and that's all"
5234.500,5235.900," are in a system"
5236.900,5238.200," doing what it does"
5239.000,5241.500," and I remember then just feeling actually this"
5243.900,5244.700," overwhelming"
5245.300,5245.800," gratitude"
5246.300,5246.500," you know"
5247.500,5248.400," but that that"
5250.100,5251.900," somehow it was given to me"
5252.500,5254.000," as it is that all of us to"
5255.000,5257.000," to have this kind of experience"
5257.900,5259.200," so rich and so"
5260.000,5261.600," it was like watching a"
5263.100,5269.700," it's as little bit liked if you can imagine I mean when I was a kid I used to be fascinated by model railways"
5270.000,5271.400," I think probably a lot of kids are"
5271.800,5274.400," maybe if the grown up men especially it's well"
5274.700,5279.100," but there was one in a town nearby that we would go to"
5280.000,5285.200," it would be a sort of Sunday excursion or Saturday skirting for the family would go every now and then and"
5285.900,5289.500," you know there'd be a certain cafe we got a piece of cake out or something"
5289.900,5291.700," and then we go to the model railway"
5292.000,5294.700," there with you you went up these that there was an it was in a"
5295.500,5298.700," it was a barber shop I think well maybe it was above a post office and"
5299.400,5301.600," now remembering with go up these stairs and"
5302.200,5303.300," come into this rather"
5304.000,5304.800," large room"
5305.700,5309.200," and up on the big sort of table top as it were"
5309.900,5311.400," there was this enormous"
5312.200,5315.100," model railway I mean that's how it struck me as a boy"
5315.600,5319.200," with with sort of hills and trees and stations in a factory and"
5319.800,5321.600," I can't really shops and streets and"
5322.400,5324.500," and lots of trains go around"
5325.100,5331.900," you know and it was like this magical little world with great detail so this was rather similar to that it was like"
5332.900,5335.500," amazing I've got this capacity to"
5336.300,5336.500," ever"
5337.100,5339.600," hold little world appear in my mind"
5340.500,5341.600," to be able to look at it"
5342.300,5346.100," and to be able to a wet to be able to be aware"
5346.800,5347.100," that"
5347.600,5350.300," part of me can gaze at this sort of model"
5351.500,5352.200," fascinating"
5352.800,5354.500," beautiful model world"
5354.800,5355.500," all of that"
5356.800,5357.400," damn"
5358.000,5358.400," we got the"
5358.900,5359.500," we've got this"
5359.900,5361.700," on board all of us have that"
5362.300,5363.000," capacity"
5363.700,5364.300," it's incredible"
5368.300,5368.600," so"
5370.400,5372.700," I think I'm wanting to sort of emphasize"
5373.400,5374.100," talking this way"
5374.700,5375.300," because the"
5378.900,5382.400," it's quite easy to get into a mindset in meditation that somehow"
5383.400,5386.200," kind of the Inner system is the problem"
5388.100,5388.700," I sit down"
5389.800,5391.000," I was supposed to not think"
5392.000,5393.500," it's supposed to focus on my breath"
5394.400,5396.300," I mean this is I'm being you know"
5397.400,5399.800," I'm exaggerating and being rather generic but"
5400.300,5402.900," I suppose to stop thinking and focus on my breath"
5404.400,5406.200," no no no no no no no"
5407.900,5411.600," absolutely though I just I don't believe with in any of that"
5412.900,5416.500," what we might say is that meditation is a past"
5416.800,5419.600," of being able to appreciate more"
5420.600,5420.900," what"
5421.700,5422.900," what is going on"
5424.000,5426.300," you know and and if what is going on"
5427.000,5427.900," is the Marvel"
5428.700,5428.900," of"
5429.800,5433.500," Voices talking in the mind of images appearing in the mind"
5434.200,5435.200," and as energy"
5436.000,5439.700," is arising somehow in here like the sound box of an instrument"
5444.500,5446.400," why wouldn't I want to appreciate that"
5447.800,5448.800," why wouldn't I want to"
5449.900,5450.500," say hey"
5451.100,5453.400," I'm getting to be a human being"
5454.300,5455.700," and I don't really know who I am"
5456.400,5458.600," actually I don't really know what a human being is"
5459.200,5460.600," but I'm getting to be one"
5462.300,5465.900," and every moment that I'm alive I'm getting to be"
5466.500,5467.300," a human being"
5468.500,5468.700," why"
5469.200,5471.800," won't I simply appreciate that"
5473.500,5475.600," rather than think it's got to be this way or that way"
5476.900,5477.200," no"
5478.800,5479.400," and actually"
5479.900,5481.400," a course what happens"
5482.000,5485.300," is the more that we can be in a place of appreciating"
5486.400,5487.800," our hearts our minds"
5488.900,5489.200," are"
5489.800,5490.200," in a"
5491.000,5491.800," apparatus"
5492.700,5495.200," the more we can be in a place of appreciating it"
5497.100,5497.600," we're actually"
5500.300,5502.200," it's sort of means by definition"
5503.000,5504.900," that we're in a place of appreciation"
5506.000,5506.800," in other words"
5508.400,5512.400," we're actually in a place of what we might call positive"
5512.800,5513.300," affect"
5514.600,5515.500," because appreciation"
5516.800,5518.400," well what is it it's some gratitude"
5519.400,5520.700," it's taking pleasure in"
5521.900,5523.400," you know and it's quite positive"
5524.800,5524.800," so"
5525.900,5528.300," how how how how interesting"
5529.000,5530.300," it can be if we"
5531.100,5534.600," you know we might be kind of grumpy or moody or in somewhere or other and"
5536.100,5539.900," and if we pause out well what's actually happening when I'm grumpy or moody or"
5540.400,5542.700," or down or feeling kind of blah"
5543.200,5547.800," not uninspired or maybe I'm just you know downright a bit depressed or"
5548.400,5551.600," maybe I'm actually grieving something or maybe whatever you know"
5552.300,5555.500," something that we call negative or maybe I'm just irritated or maybe"
5556.000,5558.300," I'm actually anxious you know whatever it might be"
5559.700,5560.400," can we"
5564.900,5567.000," can we regard that as"
5568.700,5569.700," a stringed instrument"
5571.000,5571.400," playing"
5572.200,5573.700," some kind of music"
5576.500,5576.700," and"
5578.100,5578.400," actually"
5580.200,5581.900," it's part of the human experience"
5583.000,5584.600," it's part of what it is to be human"
5586.100,5586.700," can I"
5587.400,5587.700," find"
5588.700,5589.800," that there is"
5590.900,5591.900," a"
5592.700,5593.400," space"
5594.500,5595.400," of awareness"
5596.600,5598.500," that is given to me right now"
5600.000,5602.100," from which in which and from which"
5603.000,5604.100," I can appreciate"
5605.300,5605.900," the Marvel"
5606.800,5607.000," of"
5607.800,5608.300," music"
5609.700,5611.700," but this call it inner system"
5613.200,5614.700," strings and sound box"
5615.500,5616.200," is creating"
5622.100,5624.900," and somehow that also kind of Changes Everything"
5626.300,5628.100," I've no longer at war with myself"
5629.300,5631.300," trying to make it this way not that way"
5632.200,5633.900," trying to make it that kind of music"
5634.500,5635.300," and I want there"
5635.900,5637.400," tad and tell her I want the"
5638.300,5639.700," Beethoven it's whatever"
5640.400,5643.900," and I want the adagio I want the alligator you know"
5644.800,5646.500," no it's music man"
5647.300,5648.600," you know let's appreciate it"
5649.900,5650.500," it's amazing"
5651.100,5651.700," to be having"
5652.100,5652.500," human"
5652.900,5653.600," experience"
5654.500,5655.200," and somehow I mean"
5655.800,5658.700," I don't know whether this is working for you but for me anytime"
5659.500,5663.500," I can I can come to that you know a place of feeling"
5668.400,5670.100," I don't know that it's"
5672.700,5674.500," that I'm I'm just touching"
5675.800,5678.800," even very lightly glancing subtly"
5679.200,5680.700," and awareness of"
5682.500,5683.000," wow"
5683.600,5685.000," this moment is"
5685.500,5686.100," arising"
5686.900,5688.800," that I'm experiencing anything"
5689.500,5690.000," tool"
5691.500,5693.500," you know just a tiny hint"
5694.600,5695.400," of that"
5697.400,5699.900," well I suppose a awareness that it is remarkable"
5700.600,5703.000," it is remarkable to be experiencing anything at all"
5703.500,5703.700," you know"
5704.500,5705.500," it's"
5706.800,5707.300," got"
5707.500,5708.400," it it changes everything"
5711.100,5713.300," it flips this tiny little switch"
5715.100,5716.900," and and again we might"
5717.500,5718.500," recognise that we're"
5719.500,5720.000," we're where I'm"
5722.600,5725.400," where part of all creation appearing"
5726.400,5727.000," Horizon"
5729.900,5731.400," the wine skin bursts"
5732.700,5733.100," again"
5733.600,5734.800," you know and it may not be"
5735.400,5737.100," a great dramatic rupture"
5737.700,5740.400," you know it doesn't matter it's just because if this is a little"
5740.900,5741.900," one scene"
5742.700,5743.200," drips"
5744.100,5747.100," you know the the the the the the the the seepage comes out"
5747.800,5749.600," just a little bit but that's that's enough"
5752.100,5753.500," that's enough because we sort of"
5753.900,5755.300," broken out of the"
5756.100,5757.300," constriction or the"
5758.100,5759.700," sensor containment that we"
5760.800,5762.300," we can so easily get"
5762.900,5765.700," apparently caught by burn never really caught by"
5766.300,5767.600," but apparently called bye"
5769.200,5774.300," ah there was a whole other thing I wanted to talk about when I'm not going to I'm not going to I don't think there's time"
5779.000,5779.500," actually"
5783.700,5785.100," no no I'll do it next time"
5786.000,5787.300," okay let us see"
5789.000,5792.500," let us see people for sleep is yes yes exactly"
5793.500,5794.400," exactly okay"
5794.900,5797.900," I'm going to look through some of the the chat I see there's quite a few"
5798.500,5799.400," notes in here"
5802.200,5806.000," okay so it's sounds like that oh yeah yeah great thank you"
5806.800,5812.200," I'm off for putting in that link to Just in atoms and mauro Durante thank you very much I'm sorry I got his name wrong"
5813.000,5819.100," and what you said in the way about The Master when you breathe in the immersive breathing out hit me so strong they became a kind of mantra during the day"
5819.900,5822.500," thank you I'm glad to hear that uhm"
5826.100,5830.600," yeah and Jacob thanks for I'm just looking at your point at 11:01"
5831.200,5832.100," confirming"
5834.100,5836.900," agree with you like about the anxiety can be"
5838.000,5840.500," kind of can make yeah breath practice"
5841.800,5842.700," uncomfortable"
5844.400,5848.600," exactly so it's forgive me folks I'm just glancing through just to see"
5849.500,5851.600," what I might pick up on but meanwhile"
5852.600,5854.900," we're going to be inviting questions so"
5855.300,5856.000," if anybody"
5857.100,5859.700," wants to speak a question then"
5861.700,5862.400," do please"
5864.600,5868.000," oh thanks for the kind comments about the tears thank you"
5869.100,5873.300," thank you very much for the kind comments I really moved by that actually"
5875.500,5875.900," oh um"
5877.900,5886.300," some Judy so moving as an aside I just bought my first acoustic guitar and held it for the first time and smelled the wood it's made of"
5886.900,5889.900," it feels sacred this I feel that one"
5890.500,5892.900," and I can't even play it yet that's lovely"
5894.100,5894.400," yeah"
5894.900,5895.400," yeah yeah yeah"
5896.800,5899.400," oh man thank you all it's great to see this comments"
5900.400,5905.600," well sweet invitation to be and feel such a tender reminder that where we are how we Are Who We Are is enough"
5906.300,5908.400," exactly exactly exactly"
5909.900,5911.600," exactly ummm"
5912.600,5917.100," yeah we're just I mean that's what the whole point of this programme is"
5918.100,5920.000," original love this just"
5920.800,5924.800," I mean some of you may mean maybe don't know this because I haven't talked about it"
5925.000,5927.400," and maybe I probably have talked about I always talked about"
5928.000,5930.100," it but how it came out of just sitting with"
5930.700,5934.400," these kids on a beach in Venezuela where we weren't trying to do anything"
5935.200,5935.900," you know we're just"
5936.600,5937.100," we're just"
5937.300,5937.500," just"
5938.900,5942.200," trying to give us ourselves a space not to have to try to do anything"
5943.100,5943.200," you know"
5944.300,5946.100," that's what this is supposed to be about"
5946.500,5948.300," and I believe in it actually there's a"
5949.800,5952.100," I believe it can be a real path"
5952.500,5954.000," you know the non-pass"
5954.600,5955.700," of just being"
5957.200,5960.500," of allowing ourselves just to be I think it actually can lead"
5961.600,5965.300," somewhere I don't want to say where because then we'll start thinking we got to go somewhere"
5966.200,5970.300," but I think we don't but I think just to be"
5971.300,5971.700," to sort of"
5973.800,5974.200," oh"
5975.300,5976.000," I think we need it"
5976.400,5977.000," we need it"
5983.000,5985.300," and and I suspect that many of the"
5986.100,5987.800," the beautiful things that"
5990.400,5991.800," that we are frankly"
5992.900,5995.700," and that meditation traditionally has helped us"
5996.100,5996.500," has helped"
5997.700,5998.700," to show themselves"
6000.500,6002.400," I think they can they can do that"
6003.200,6004.700," without our trying a tool"
6007.200,6008.900," that's a that's the principle"
6012.300,6015.900," so let's see yeah does anybody I'm not actually seeing a question"
6016.500,6016.800," yet"
6018.200,6020.500," if anybody wants to ask something"
6023.500,6029.100," okay when I listen to your words where is The Listening occurring it feels and sounds like it's in my heart area"
6029.700,6033.200," okay that's going to question mark at the end but I'm not exactly sure it is a question"
6034.100,6037.000," because Sean you might be just right I mean"
6037.900,6039.300," if it feels that way"
6040.300,6043.000," and sounds that way then let it be that way"
6046.900,6050.800," but but don't think that it must be every time or something because there could be times when"
6051.600,6055.100," the heart area just doesn't feel very engaged you know"
6055.700,6056.100," that can happen"
6057.400,6058.000," as well of course"
6062.500,6063.700," I'm just going to have a quick look"
6065.600,6067.800," thank you to this is from Alina"
6068.300,6072.600," thank you for taking me back to the transforming power of music from Gregorian chant"
6073.000,6075.400," multi voice early church music"
6076.100,6077.200," oh yeah to the"
6077.900,6079.600," composer musicians"
6080.000,6080.800," I presented"
6082.000,6084.300," many years ago at the Museum of contemporary art"
6085.400,6087.200," the aacm Association"
6087.800,6089.900," for the advancement of creative musicians"
6090.300,6092.700," committed to improvisation is what they're called it"
6093.300,6094.800," powerful and so in the moment"
6095.500,6099.600," in a small gallery space and shared with a breathing audience"
6101.100,6101.600," lovely"
6102.400,6103.300," thank you for sharing that"
6103.900,6105.300," yeah these live"
6106.400,6111.600," things can be so powerful but then we find it can also be powerful in this zoom space"
6112.500,6114.300," I'm feeling it can really do something"
6115.600,6118.900," I hope I hope you some of you do some of the time at least"
6120.100,6126.700," let me see Elizabeth I need I think I need to figure out what I should be doing but maybe I need to turn inward and appreciate my instrument"
6130.800,6132.300," yeah but you know don't"
6132.800,6133.400," again in this"
6134.000,6135.500," approach of we're just"
6136.700,6140.200," but then what rather us not feel we have to do anything"
6141.400,6144.800," that we're learning a way of doing less"
6147.100,6149.800," and that's okay it's like we just um"
6153.600,6156.500," I mean I I don't know if you can even just feel it now just"
6157.300,6158.100," what is it like"
6159.600,6161.000," you know to just let go"
6162.800,6165.400," and you don't have to do a thing called letting go"
6165.900,6166.200," actually"
6167.700,6169.500," you just you just being"
6173.900,6174.700," and it's quiet"
6177.500,6178.000," and it's"
6179.300,6182.200," there might be a sort of soft feeling of some kind I don't know"
6183.500,6183.800," but you just"
6186.300,6191.400," let's get it we're it doesn't have to be foggy either you know it can be quite clear"
6192.900,6194.400," as a clear the can be"
6195.300,6196.400," clear awareness"
6197.700,6200.000," there can be a Tenderness"
6203.600,6207.100," there could also be in uncomfortable now this at times"
6208.300,6209.600," but we're going to just be"
6211.900,6212.700," you know and we're"
6213.800,6215.200," we're not gonna"
6216.300,6217.500," have to pick up"
6218.700,6222.600," method and not have to pick up something we need to do"
6224.000,6224.500," just just"
6228.000,6228.700," yeah just"
6230.500,6231.500," easy being"
6232.600,6232.800," you know"
6234.200,6234.900," that's that's"
6236.500,6237.300," okay too"
6237.900,6238.700," so let me see it so"
6239.500,6240.600," a bit more coming okay"
6243.700,6245.100," I feel like there's a longing"
6245.400,6249.200," to be ruptured but even that long as a type of triangle yes"
6249.900,6254.000," how does one let go of that needing longing is still feels like a type of performance anxiety"
6254.400,6255.700," is that how did well put"
6256.300,6260.000," I've I think it is performance things that can be performance anxiety"
6260.700,6262.100," well here's the thing"
6263.000,6265.100," when that comes up"
6267.200,6269.200," we just let that"
6269.800,6270.700," come up"
6271.300,6272.800," we let that be"
6274.100,6274.700," part of"
6275.400,6276.200," what is a rising"
6277.200,6277.400," now"
6278.400,6279.600," so there's a difference"
6280.200,6282.100," I don't know if I can say this clearly"
6282.600,6283.200," so let's say"
6283.700,6284.900," something comes up like"
6285.600,6286.500," oh I want to"
6287.700,6289.100," experience x"
6290.300,6294.500," and this that's a some kind of a Desire or intention for our meditation"
6296.100,6296.200," now"
6297.800,6300.000," there's two ways of experiencing that"
6303.400,6305.300," I'm trying to be clear in my own mind"
6305.800,6306.700," the first way"
6307.600,6308.000," is that"
6308.500,6308.900," we're just"
6309.500,6312.400," sort of driven by it we're caught in it"
6313.100,6314.100," and we're not really"
6314.800,6315.300," teeing it"
6316.500,6319.000," as a thing that's a rising because we're"
6319.500,6321.900," it's occupying us and driving us"
6322.500,6326.700," and so we're getting the feeling oh I'm I want to try to have this experience x"
6327.500,6330.000," that's the first way of experiencing that"
6330.600,6331.500," the second way"
6332.500,6333.000," is when"
6334.600,6335.800," it's just the same"
6336.500,6338.200," it's a rising just as it is"
6339.700,6340.700," but somehow"
6342.400,6343.400," what we are"
6345.000,6346.200," is a little bigger"
6346.800,6347.500," than it"
6347.900,6348.900," in the first way"
6349.600,6353.200," it's a rising I'm just trying to explain this in a certain way"
6353.700,6355.100," I don't know exactly how to put it but"
6355.600,6356.300," in the first way"
6357.300,6361.700," is occupying us and it's sort of in the driving seat and it's making us"
6362.100,6363.200," feel that way I got to get"
6363.600,6364.300," some other experience"
6364.800,6365.100," let's say"
6366.100,6367.100," but in the second way"
6367.700,6369.900," it's a rising just just the same"
6370.600,6371.700," the difference is"
6373.100,6373.200," that"
6373.700,6377.100," we are not wholly occupied by it instead"
6378.200,6380.600," we're a tiny tiny bit bigger"
6382.200,6382.800," there's just this"
6383.800,6384.500," micro"
6385.900,6386.400," level"
6386.800,6387.900," of atmosphere"
6388.200,6391.700," just like the you know how thin the atmosphere is around the earth right"
6392.400,6394.300," it's like that we just got this little"
6395.100,6396.700," atmospheric membrane"
6397.600,6398.400," of awareness"
6398.800,6399.300," around"
6400.000,6400.200," that"
6401.700,6402.000," sense"
6402.500,6405.500," of needing to feel something different experience something different"
6406.000,6406.200," okay"
6406.900,6408.800," needing to try to get somewhere so to think"
6410.700,6414.000," if we are just that little incrementally bit"
6414.700,6414.900," bigger"
6416.400,6417.500," then we can"
6420.100,6421.100,"we can actually"
6422.100,6423.000," inhabit"
6425.400,6428.500," sorry my my words aren't very clear today but"
6428.900,6431.600," we can actually inhabit this little layer"
6432.000,6433.400," thin layer of a awareness"
6434.200,6434.900," that accept"
6435.700,6436.700," that this thing is arising"
6438.700,6441.300," and then we're not actually compelled bye"
6442.100,6443.800," it any longer because we see"
6444.600,6444.900," oh"
6445.600,6447.500," it's a little cluster of stuff"
6448.100,6448.900," a rising"
6449.800,6450.200," in"
6452.100,6453.300," the field of"
6454.400,6455.100," my awareness"
6456.300,6457.400," and that makes all the difference"
6457.900,6458.100," because"
6459.900,6460.100," it's"
6460.800,6462.700," really a rising just as it is"
6464.200,6466.300," and we're fine to let it arise"
6468.500,6469.500," but when not actually"
6470.400,6471.000," caught"
6471.200,6474.600," in feeling compelled to do what it's saying we should be trying to do"
6475.700,6476.100," that makes sense"
6478.800,6481.800," I feel there might be a better way to say what I just said but"
6482.700,6486.400," I think it's about right that there's a way of experiencing"
6488.000,6489.500," any actual sort of"
6492.500,6495.600,"play it's another kind of is another kind of music"
6496.500,6498.700," that is another kind of music it's still"
6499.200,6501.800," the same stringed instrument the same sound box"
6502.300,6503.800," but it's making a different sound"
6504.400,6506.200," but it's still the same instrument"
6506.700,6507.700," is the inner system"
6508.400,6509.400," playing another song"
6509.900,6511.500," playing another two playing another"
6512.000,6514.200," drum strum strum or chords whatever it is"
6515.300,6516.800," but it's still the same instrument so"
6517.800,6519.500," can I be aware of the instrument"
6520.300,6521.300," playing that tune"
6524.000,6525.000," if I can"
6525.900,6527.400," then I'm not so compelled"
6529.100,6530.300," to do what it was telling me to do"
6530.700,6531.100," see what I mean"
6532.700,6534.500," okay now let me just have a quick look"
6539.200,6539.800," yeah okay"
6540.800,6545.900," diona to observe us and not try to put your mind in some specific state do you recommend practice"
6546.500,6548.000," to practice more open awareness"
6550.300,6555.300," yeah and but I mean I think that's right but the question is how do you get to open awareness"
6556.200,6557.000," and my"
6557.600,6559.700," my understanding or my experience with that"
6560.200,6560.600," is"
6561.500,6566.200," it's it's it's it's it's all about and it's just like we were just I was just saying it's similar with that"
6566.400,6568.100," it's can we get to"
6569.900,6572.500," just having a little space around"
6573.600,6574.500," our experience"
6575.200,6578.600," that's what open awareness is really it's a little bit of space"
6580.100,6581.200," and and the"
6581.800,6583.200," had to get there well"
6584.200,6585.500," some of you just do"
6586.300,6588.300," you just find there is this bit of space"
6589.300,6592.200," and sometimes we go by the path of allowing"
6592.700,6593.300," allowing"
6593.800,6595.200," unconditional allowing"
6596.000,6598.700," or maybe it's not unconditional this conditional at first"
6599.400,6601.000," but we just keep allowing"
6601.800,6602.400," allowing"
6603.500,6604.000," allowing"
6605.200,6605.700," and allowing"
6606.900,6607.400," allow"
6607.600,6608.900," it you know we can do it actually"
6610.700,6611.300," and allowing"
6615.900,6616.400," that's it"
6618.500,6620.300," okay Tom in the iter"
6620.700,6621.500," and mute"
6624.500,6625.500," yes um"
6626.600,6627.700," are you familiar with"
6628.200,6629.600," Sylvan Esso Tompkins"
6630.300,6632.500," his affect Theory"
6633.600,6634.100," no"
6635.000,6637.800," um because you speak it eloquently"
6638.500,6639.900," like you you mentioned"
6641.100,6641.800," they're basically"
6643.000,6645.600," he spent brilliant man spent his life"
6646.600,6647.400," his life's work"
6648.000,6651.100," investigating what he's calling the affect system"
6652.000,6653.300," and that is in innately"
6654.200,6657.200," biologically transmitted set of reactions"
6658.100,6659.100," he had identified"
6659.600,6660.400," eight of them"
6661.300,6664.200," but we're born with them and you can see them in infants"
6664.500,6666.900," before the cognitive part kicks in"
6667.300,6668.300," or we start to imagine"
6669.000,6671.700," and that's where thought triggers affect and have a"
6672.100,6672.500," all of that"
6672.900,6676.300," but before that happens you can actually see it in infants"
6677.900,6678.000," the"
6679.200,6680.500," affective responses"
6682.000,6682.000," so"
6682.500,6682.800," um"
6684.200,6685.100," yeah I've spent my"
6685.800,6688.200," the last five years deeply studying"
6688.900,6691.800," his his work affect imagery consciousness"
6692.400,6695.300," affect is what we just talked about the innate have x"
6695.600,6699.500," imagery when the contest mines starts to be able to make an image of the"
6700.000,6701.400," myself and it"
6702.000,6708.500," oh that's what happened last all of that apparatus kicks in and consciousness is the field in which it all takes place"
6709.800,6711.900,"so anyway I'm just"
6712.500,6716.600," I'm so into it because it's been very helpful to me I had a traumatic childhood"
6718.800,6723.900," I'm pretty much learned to disassociate myself from my emotions because it's so painful"
6724.600,6725.400," and you mentioned"
6726.000,6727.700," you're only experience of that kind of thing"
6728.700,6730.000," um so I just wanted"
6730.500,6733.000," to throw that out and just say that that"
6733.500,6735.700," innately or somehow you come upon"
6736.400,6737.000," in my"
6737.900,6738.500," mind"
6739.100,6739.800," I very"
6740.400,6744.700," acute understanding of that affect system well I'm"
6745.400,6748.900," coming straight up so that's why I'm just going my cut and that's what led me to you"
6749.700,6751.500," through I went through trauma Thurman"
6752.000,6756.200," into the affects studying that because somebody mentioned it and I got sucked in big"
6756.700,6760.600," because every time I read and learn more of like about shame"
6761.300,6762.200," you have to go in"
6762.800,6766.600," and feel the shame and work with it and then it becomes very very"
6767.300,6767.900," delineated"
6768.600,6769.600," nuanced"
6770.000,6772.000," and all of that is helped me greatly"
6773.100,6775.600," in what you're proposing I I that's"
6776.200,6780.600," really it I just want to say it's been an incredibly valuable tool"
6781.200,6783.500," to really get to understand this"
6787.100,6787.800," resonant"
6788.200,6789.100," sound box"
6789.500,6789.700," of"
6791.000,6794.900," yes so anyway yeah I guess that's all yeah"
6795.900,6804.300," that thank you thank you very much I wonder whether you you could just stick a link in the chat actually got barbecue is myself to know more about"
6804.900,6809.100," silvan Tomkins I think you said that's I'm great I'm happy to hear what you say"
6809.900,6811.300," I think that"
6813.000,6815.200," you know I think in a certain way my you know"
6816.000,6818.700," through sitting with in the Zen Style"
6819.800,6822.300," didn't speak to it so much but it"
6822.600,6822.900," did"
6824.500,6826.300," provide a kind of"
6828.900,6831.600," I suppose you know like a space of"
6833.300,6841.400," because that because they're so low on specific guidance in the methodologies of meditation in zen they tended to say sit there you know"
6842.000,6843.100," you kind of have to"
6844.200,6844.500," either"
6845.700,6850.700," suffer a great deal well he probably do that but it also can in time learn"
6851.800,6857.700," you know in your own way what's going on here the question is then it's always seems to be"
6858.300,6860.300," what's really going on here"
6861.100,6861.500," and I think"
6862.800,6863.900," daddying that"
6864.700,6869.300," can can can can can bring us to these conclusions because I think they're real and I think"
6870.700,6877.000," it's a good way of so anyway thank you for there's a certain affirmation I feel you are offering me"
6877.800,6880.700," which I'm happy to receive thank you but"
6881.900,6883.000," didn't dog into say this"
6883.400,6885.200," to study the surface to Forget Yourself"
6885.800,6886.200," is that"
6886.600,6888.200," he was saying and now we have"
6888.600,6889.200," this kind of scient"
6890.200,6890.700," Western"
6891.400,6892.200," evaluative"
6893.100,6896.000," body of information but it's really that"
6896.700,6897.200," it's yes"
6898.300,6898.400," yeah"
6899.000,6900.800," yeah I agree with you I agree with you"

6911.100,6914.500," if it's still relevant it we can we can make sure that happens"
6915.100,6915.900," because I have to"
