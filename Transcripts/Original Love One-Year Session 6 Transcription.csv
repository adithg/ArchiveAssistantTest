280.200,284.900," or maybe not even that deep down but just we don't know really notice it but the real here"
285.900,288.700," that which is aware of here"
289.500,291.600," that which is aware"
292.500,293.800," of whatever is arising"
294.300,295.700," For You Here and Now"
296.500,296.700," both"
298.500,299.600," in terms of how you're doing"
301.200,301.900," and in terms of"
302.700,303.100," what your"
303.600,305.000," immediately experiencing"
306.500,307.900," so to speak externally"
309.000,312.300," in both cases that which is aware"
312.600,312.700," of"
313.200,313.400," it"
315.500,316.800," and is the true"
317.700,318.000," here"
319.800,320.900," is actually the same"
321.400,321.900," for all of us"
323.400,324.500," we meet in"
325.500,326.600," the real"
328.400,328.700," here"
330.800,331.800," that which is always here"
333.700,333.700," so"
334.700,334.900," that's"
337.400,337.800," kind of"
339.100,341.000," the target zone of today's session"
341.600,343.700," coming back to original"
344.500,344.800," love"
345.800,348.200," and those of you with a Zen background"
349.900,353.300," and maybe some of you who don't have a Zen background will have heard"
353.700,354.200," of the expression"
354.900,356.500," seeing your original"
357.000,357.300," face"
358.600,359.900," it's a one of them's"
360.400,362.100," somewhat poetic Waze"
363.900,364.800," of talking about"
365.800,367.100," an experience"
367.800,369.400," or a way of experiencing"
372.100,373.000," there's always going on"
374.200,374.800," but all of us"
375.700,378.200," and for most of us most of the time"
379.100,379.900," we overlooked it"
381.000,381.900," we just"
382.500,385.200," we just don't pay attention in that direction"
386.000,387.900," so we don't see the original face"
388.900,389.500," but what"
389.900,390.600," then"
391.500,392.000," discovered"
392.600,394.700," in the sixth- seventh- century"
395.600,396.700," is that it actually"
397.500,398.300," in a certain way"
399.400,400.700," it didn't take"
401.200,402.100," years of"
403.500,406.000," diligent dedicated arduous"
406.200,406.800," practice"
407.800,408.200," to see"
409.000,409.400," the original"
409.900,410.200," face"
411.300,412.700," they realise that actually"
414.600,416.900," in a more kind of democratic way actually"
417.600,419.000," anybody could see"
419.700,420.900," because this really always here"
422.200,423.300," it's just a matter of"
424.000,424.800," a tweak in"
425.800,427.700," the angle of our vision"
429.300,430.200," and we notice it"
431.300,434.600," and um so so in our sit today I'm going to be"
435.200,437.100," just sort of seeing what what we can do"
437.500,438.200," come back"
439.200,440.400," to it it's like"
441.700,442.500," it's really the"
443.400,448.100," it's you know you'll have heard me mentioned some of you before the story of a dancer"
448.500,449.600," who was a meditator"
450.000,452.900," and who created a dance piece about meditation"
453.800,455.700," and in the peace she"
456.200,457.200," she just had a"
457.800,461.500," a set of cushions a matte and a cushion and Center stage"
461.800,463.800," I mean I've never seen this I've only heard it described"
464.200,467.400," and she she sat on her cushion the dance was basically"
468.100,469.100," she sits on a cushion"
470.100,470.300," and"
471.700,474.500," you know gets in her meditation posture and is there for a moment"
475.200,478.800," and then looks around looks around the stage and all different directions you know"
479.400,481.000," and then suddenly remembers where she is"
481.500,482.800," and it gets back in the meditation"
483.700,485.300," then a moment later- again"
485.900,488.500," she looks up and she just gets up and runs over to something"
489.100,492.800," and dances around a little bit and then happens to turn around and see the cushion again"
493.200,493.800," it comes oh"
494.500,496.100," it's carrying back to it sits down again"
496.600,500.400," and then you know and on it goes until she's on a wild dance all around the stage"
500.900,502.800," you know and then again spots the cushion"
503.400,504.300," it looks a little moment"
504.800,507.200," doesn't care Carolina dancing looks at it again"
507.600,507.900," oh yeah"
508.200,508.400," okay"
508.900,510.200," comes back and sit down again"
510.700,511.400," and so that's a"
512.200,512.800," that's a"
513.200,516.300," beautiful you know portrayal of the process of"
517.000,520.100," meditating you know you most of us are given a thing like"
520.400,521.300," bolly or breathe and"
521.700,524.400," so we try to follow our breath we sit with the breath and then we're off"
524.700,527.400," all over the place you know in space and time we're gone"
528.100,529.400," from here then we come back"
530.300,531.400," then we can't then we come back"
532.300,532.800," but actually"
533.600,537.600," in a certain way I think that's also true of how how life goes that"
538.200,540.400," that sometimes we're we're really"
541.200,543.200," grounded in here and now"
544.200,547.900," and then we can get long stretches where we're just totally caught in"
549.000,550.300," projects and you know"
550.800,553.300," produce a different kinds work relationships"
553.900,557.100," you know whatever it may be creativity creative things a different kinds"
557.700,562.300," we're just caught in them in these great long sweeps and arcs and trajectories"
563.200,564.400," a project and you know it's"
565.200,568.200," that's all well and good and great and fine"
568.900,572.400," may well bring us a lot of satisfaction along with all the challenges and stuff"
574.800,575.400," but actually"
577.600,579.800," we're still missing the seat"
580.700,583.300," you know it's because he can be you can be doing projects"
584.000,585.700," whatever you projects you want you know"
586.500,587.400," as long as they're not harmful"
588.300,588.400," and"
589.300,589.400," still"
590.800,591.700," day in the sea"
592.600,594.400," Day in in the real here"
595.700,596.500," that is aware"
598.700,599.100," so"
602.000,603.500," so let's come into our our sit"
608.200,608.700," so I'm"
609.600,612.400," gonna be just getting comfortable is the first thing"
613.800,615.500," we we want to"
616.500,619.400," set a smooth out the hard line between"
620.200,621.500," non sitting and sitting"
622.100,622.900," is an invitation"
624.000,625.700," it's just an invitation it's just"
628.000,629.000," it's not like"
630.100,631.000," there's the cushion"
631.700,632.000," boom"
632.600,633.800," I've got to start sitting"
634.400,635.000," it's more like"
636.100,637.400," oh there's cushion over there"
638.300,640.300," there's a seat waiting for me over there"
640.900,642.600," I'm going to wind my way"
643.900,644.300," to order"
645.500,647.200,"so now here I am sitting"
648.300,648.800," but actually"
649.900,652.000," I'm not really yet arrived"
653.300,654.000," in the seat"
655.900,657.700," I want to just feel into what"
658.600,661.100," what might be present for me"
664.000,666.400," that his reluctant to go and sit"
666.800,668.500," and be here and be still"
675.800,677.200," and whatever I may find"
678.300,678.400," that"
680.500,680.700," isn't"
681.600,682.700," quite ready to"
684.400,684.900," land"
686.700,687.600," and arrived"
689.600,692.000," let me make space for it let me welcome"
694.700,696.100," it let me feel it in my body"
699.400,700.100," and tell it"

737.900,739.300," it's not a narrow box"
740.900,741.600," it's more like"
742.800,743.300," actually"
745.500,747.700," the the place of meditation"
748.900,752.500," in reference to that dance isn't just the one little cushion"
753.200,754.600," is the whole stage"
756.800,757.300," and the"
758.600,761.500," the Wings as they call them of the stage and the"
762.300,765.200," ceiling lights and the Rods and"
765.900,768.800," all the things stored up above the stage all of that"
769.900,771.500," is the arena"
772.500,773.300," of meditation"
779.000,780.000," we're actually arriving"
781.000,782.200," in something larger"
784.100,784.900," than Just us"
799.400,800.600," it's a big sky"

850.700,852.200," has check that your balance"
854.900,855.800," if you need to be"
857.800,860.300," which is best if your spine is free"
863.000,865.300," might do a little gentle Sway"
866.500,868.000," or and oft"
870.900,873.600," you like the master of a ship"
874.800,876.100," oh an old and"
876.800,878.000," olden day ship"
880.700,881.300," weighing"
882.700,884.100," backwards and forwards"
885.500,886.500," on the swells"

905.700,906.700," learning all the"
907.400,910.100," all the micro muscles of the face relaxed"
913.000,914.800," kind of like complex rigging"
916.400,917.900," on an old sailing ship"
918.800,920.000," that can go Slack"
926.700,927.800," and feel how that"
928.800,928.900," that"
929.800,931.600," releasing that letting go"
932.900,933.000," can"
933.700,937.600," gently rain down through the body so the throat relaxes"
938.800,941.200," shoulders and arms hands relaxed"
945.100,946.500," like slack rigging"
949.000,951.600," shoulders clavicles chest"

985.000,989.000," all system"
993.000,994.300," gently gradually"
995.500,996.300," powering down"
1008.100,1009.600," and as we powered down"
1010.600,1012.700," this remembering that the whole space"
1014.100,1016.700," this big sky of meditation"
1017.800,1018.800," this large"
1019.000,1021.000," Theatre of meditation"
1022.200,1023.400," it can handle"
1024.400,1025.900," whatever we've got going on"
1027.500,1029.000," so even while"
1030.600,1033.100," we're powering down if we find this"
1034.600,1038.600," ah but uncomfortable energy is here and there that may show up"
1039.600,1042.000," don't don't worry about it they're welcome"
1043.400,1045.800," the large space the big roof"

1086.900,1089.000," by his call original love"
1091.300,1093.200,"an original space"
1095.500,1096.300," always"
1097.500,1098.100," present"
1111.800,1113.300," always patient"

1127.900,1128.700," allow it"
1231.800,1232.900,"so we're going to"
1234.400,1235.300," just gently"
1237.500,1239.900," invite ourselves to start exploring"
1242.100,1244.200," what is it there's always been here"
1249.600,1252.400," is there for example in awareness"
1254.000,1255.300," without"
1256.900,1259.300," her reference to the contents"
1260.300,1261.600," of it over awareness"
1262.400,1263.200," so right now"
1264.900,1265.900," they're experiencing"
1268.100,1269.800," some amount of external"
1270.100,1271.300," sense experience"
1272.700,1273.300," sounds"
1276.000,1277.300," body sensations"
1279.000,1282.600," some awareness of sight"
1283.500,1284.100," seeing"
1288.900,1289.700," and all those"
1291.100,1292.600," elements show up"
1294.400,1295.100," burn awareness"
1297.000,1298.000," that's already here"
1302.200,1303.700," ready to be aware of them"
1309.800,1311.800," was like a kind of canvas and"
1313.600,1313.900," whenever"
1315.000,1317.800," a dab of paint or a stroke of painters"
1319.300,1320.000," is showing up"
1320.500,1321.700," the other canvas is"
1324.000,1324.600," ready for it"
1331.100,1332.800," could be the sound of a car"
1335.900,1337.300," or wind in trees"
1339.800,1341.800," or waves breaking"
1349.300,1349.900," would be"
1351.000,1352.800," the harm of an air conditioner"
1355.100,1355.500," could be"
1357.100,1359.300," sensational foot on floor"
1363.500,1367.000," each and all of them show up"
1368.600,1368.900," in a"
1369.600,1370.400," pre-existing"
1371.400,1372.100," awareness"
1379.800,1381.700," and awareness always ready"
1382.800,1383.700," to be aware"
1385.100,1386.000," of experience"
1398.900,1400.800," the invitation is to kind of"
1401.900,1404.600," let that awareness by itself"
1405.800,1407.900," as if as if you're a sponge"
1409.000,1412.100," and there's a kind of damp wool behind you"
1413.500,1416.800," that the dampness the moisture of awareness"
1417.700,1418.600," is seeping"
1419.900,1420.500," forward"
1421.500,1422.300," into you"
1423.400,1424.000," into your"
1425.400,1427.200," telly and a tissue of your body"
1430.600,1433.700," a warmth in the moisture of aware this"
1435.900,1436.600," gently"
1438.000,1440.700," softening you"
1443.000,1444.000," Deeping into"
1446.300,1448.900," the Fabric of your experience"
1450.400,1453.700," and you don't have to do anything"
1458.600,1461.600," very gently absorbing letting this"
1463.200,1463.900," awareness"
1466.100,1467.500," permeate us"
1497.000,1499.400,"and again it's actually fine if"
1500.000,1502.000," thoughts and feelings arise"
1502.800,1503.600," they too"
1504.300,1505.000," arise"
1506.900,1507.500," in"
1508.600,1509.400," awareness"
1513.800,1515.000," without awareness"
1516.900,1518.300," we wouldn't experienced them"
1521.100,1522.600," same awareness"
1525.100,1525.700," actually"
1526.300,1527.100," permeates"
1528.500,1530.900," thoughts and feelings emotions"
1536.600,1538.500," energies of affect"
1542.800,1544.000," are all showing"
1546.200,1547.200," up in the one"
1549.800,1552.600," permeating dissolving absorb"
1553.500,1554.200," awareness"
1608.200,1612.000," and if we bring back that stage better for"
1612.700,1613.800," or analogue"
1614.500,1615.700," the theatre space"
1618.000,1619.300," all that appears"
1620.900,1621.800," there his Li"
1622.900,1625.800," by the one light of awareness"
1628.200,1630.300," is the light of awareness"
1631.600,1633.600," that allows whatever appears"
1634.500,1635.200," to appear"
1641.800,1643.500," all in any experience"
1648.100,1649.900," memories imagining"

1664.100,1664.800," sensing"
1666.100,1666.700," seeing"
1673.700,1676.100," they're all arising within the theatre"
1677.200,1678.100," by awareness"
1679.300,1680.100," lit by"
1680.600,1681.100," the lighting"
1682.500,1683.300," of awareness"
1792.500,1794.900,"what would it be like just a boss"
1796.300,1798.700," in the wall light the warm glow"
1800.400,1801.200," of awareness"
1806.200,1807.700," and it's a fused you"
1813.200,1817.600," a fuse the whole stage a few views all your experience"

1902.100,1903.500," notice that"
1904.700,1907.200," it's showing up in awareness"
1908.700,1909.800," without awareness"
1911.700,1913.800," no awareness of restlessness"
1916.000,1917.100," and awareness"

1927.700,1928.800," restlessness"
1932.300,1934.000," for example"

2516.200,2517.600," to bring movement"
2518.600,2519.500," back into the body"

2889.100,2890.100," okay"
2891.000,2891.600," so I think"
2893.000,2895.200," handle people still seem to be just"
2896.100,2898.000," not quite back so we're going to"
2899.000,2900.600," we're gonna just ease our way in"
2902.700,2904.400," and I'm going to I'm going to try to"
2905.400,2910.300," do my best to offer some sort of thoughts about about original face"
2911.000,2912.300," slash original love"
2913.000,2913.900," I don't know how"
2914.500,2917.500," any of you found that that meditation I'd be curious to hear"
2919.100,2919.400," you know"
2919.900,2921.300," was it helpful was it"
2922.100,2923.600," baffling or what you know"
2924.900,2926.400," maybe we'll see in a little bit"
2929.900,2930.000," but"
2931.900,2934.800," this this term original"
2935.200,2935.600," face"
2937.900,2940.100," which I personally have kind of"
2940.900,2942.800," well it was the inspiration really"
2943.300,2946.700," I mean it's not a whole lot of inspiration but for the term original love"
2947.400,2948.900," I want to try to sit back and"
2949.500,2950.100," sort of explained"
2950.900,2954.100," might what what in my experience made me"
2956.500,2959.300," think that original love was an appropriate term"
2962.300,2963.900," but we're going to start with the original face"
2964.400,2965.000," I am"
2965.700,2966.300," I've been pretty"
2967.300,2968.000," sort of"
2969.700,2973.500," brought up lately and thinking you know had a lot of sort of thinking about"
2974.200,2975.100," human violence"
2976.300,2979.300," and human aggression you know because on on the face of it I mean"
2980.100,2980.700," you know we"
2981.300,2982.700," we know Canada"
2983.200,2985.700," you know I've talked about this in recent Talk's you know"
2986.200,2986.900," we know that"
2987.800,2988.100," the"
2989.000,2991.900," sort of special capacities that sapiens"
2992.600,2994.000," has had the loud"
2994.700,2995.100," are"
2995.900,2999.300," you know really you know visa via the species are"
2999.900,3004.400," technological scientific technological knowledge and sort of understanding"
3004.900,3009.700," all of that to develop the way it has along with other site other aspects of Culture that are"
3010.200,3011.700," really About Beauty and"
3013.000,3013.700," and and and"
3014.700,3018.700," beautiful ways of thinking about our existence and our experience and"
3019.300,3022.000," and and sort of into that category you might add"
3022.600,3026.800," you know the meditative contemplative discoveries and pathways that have been"
3027.300,3029.200," laid out and that have been"
3030.200,3034.500," advertised in sense of pointed pointed to hey try going this way"
3035.100,3037.100," you know our capacity to sort of think about"
3037.900,3042.500," how to live and to try to live and to have some sense to try to live well to have some"
3043.500,3043.700," some"
3044.500,3045.400," even idea that"
3046.100,3047.700," it could be possible to live"
3049.000,3051.800," you know well or not so well and what would that mean and"
3052.300,3052.900," you know and"
3053.300,3053.900," all of that"
3054.500,3055.500," comes out of"
3056.600,3057.900," the fact that we can"
3059.700,3060.900," with very good"
3061.800,3063.800," collaborative communication"
3064.800,3067.000," we can communicate with one another"
3067.500,3071.600," and are symbolic communication language that develops spectacularly"
3072.400,3074.500," you know we have frameworks of ideas and"
3075.000,3079.500," brain works for the frameworks and frameworks for the frameworks for the frameworks for the ideas"
3080.000,3083.100," and you know we can do all that and communicate it and share it"
3083.600,3085.600," and all that collaborative stuff"
3086.400,3088.000," has you know resulted in"
3089.000,3090.900," you know and what in some ways is a remarkable"
3091.800,3092.500," really and"
3092.700,3094.300," you know and evolving"
3095.000,3097.500," understanding and capacities you know"
3098.200,3099.900," of course there's a dark side to that"
3100.500,3100.700," because"
3102.200,3103.700," it we're also creating"
3104.400,3105.300," a lot of"
3106.400,3108.300," technological capacity for Destruction"
3109.100,3109.200," and"
3109.900,3111.500," and we're destroying"
3113.100,3116.100," the delicate or maybe not so delicate but with"
3117.000,3118.000," now in the away at our"
3118.600,3122.400," the eco ecosystems of this planet in ways that are"
3123.100,3124.000," um probably"
3124.800,3129.100," detrimental were less undoubtedly detrimental to many species"
3130.000,3131.100," including us you know"
3131.900,3134.000," um but along with that"
3134.800,3139.400," without even going to that just along with that capacity for collaborative endeavour"
3139.900,3140.600," Co-operative"

3170.800,3171.800," for slaughtering each other"
3172.900,3174.600," you know it's extraordinary really there"
3175.100,3179.200," the the how I know there's different theories about"
3180.000,3182.400," when and how warfare developed some say"
3182.900,3184.200," it's comparatively recent"
3185.900,3186.000," but"
3186.900,3187.900," I don't know I mean"
3188.500,3189.000," they've been"
3190.000,3191.100," at least 6"
3191.900,3193.800," cute homo species that"
3194.700,3195.500," we know of"

3199.800,3203.400," Ollie onto logical paleontology paleontological record"
3203.900,3206.300," says at least six or so human species"

3208.800,3210.600," but it will only one of them still going"
3211.200,3212.800," what happened to the others you know"
3213.400,3213.700," is it"
3216.100,3218.100," isn't it quite likely that we"
3218.800,3221.000," we because sapiens are still here"
3221.800,3224.500," they the others didn't have such an easy time with sapiens"

3229.100,3229.900," Australia"

3234.300,3235.800," almost all the megaphone"
3236.600,3237.100," is dead"
3237.700,3238.300," is extinct"
3238.700,3241.300," with the exception of big kangaroos with something like that you know"
3241.900,3242.200," we're"
3243.100,3245.000," we've got this I mean that's that's"
3245.600,3246.800," other species fair enough"
3247.600,3248.600," but we just"
3249.300,3251.400," haven't figured out how to stop killing each other"
3252.400,3252.700," basically"
3254.600,3254.800," and"
3255.400,3257.300," you know I've talked before about the you know this"
3258.200,3261.300," I love brand hares book on dogs and"
3262.000,3264.600," boxes wolves and dogs as well worth reading it's called"
3265.300,3267.400," survival of the friendliest and it's about"
3268.100,3269.100," this very point"
3270.700,3273.300," collaborative co-operative side of our neurology"
3273.600,3276.200," this helped this design to be able to do that very well"
3276.900,3278.900," or evolved to be able to do that very well"
3279.500,3282.800," and then on the other hand it also evolved to be really good at"
3283.400,3284.900," dehumanising other"
3285.300,3285.900," humans"
3286.500,3288.200," deciding those humans"
3288.900,3290.600," aren't human like we are"
3291.400,3292.300," and can be treated"
3293.000,3293.200," with"
3293.900,3295.300," Merciless cruelty"
3295.900,3301.200," there's no bounds on how cruelly they deserve to be treated and it can be whole groups"
3301.900,3303.400," and usually is groups actually"
3303.800,3305.000," and you know if you look at the"
3305.700,3305.900," the"
3307.000,3310.200," religious Wars in Europe I mean in England in the"
3310.700,3312.200," 16th century when they were just"
3313.500,3317.400," Protestant Catholic processing Catholic whichever it was empower"
3318.000,3318.400," the other"
3319.100,3320.200," team then"
3320.800,3323.900," would get you know boiled slowly to death"
3324.400,3325.700," it wasn't enough to just kill him"
3326.300,3328.800," they got to be killed very slowly and very painfully that"
3329.100,3331.800," dunk them in boiling water pool them out so they're still alive"
3332.300,3333.100," and then back in"
3333.500,3336.400," and out and back in and I mean they they were"
3336.900,3339.800," is unbelievable the ways they devised"
3340.200,3341.200," to torture one another"
3341.800,3342.600," all over"
3343.100,3344.900," a belief system that made"
3345.800,3347.600," other people not be people"
3349.000,3349.900," because they"
3350.700,3354.300," knew that God's which you know the story of God"
3354.700,3359.300," has an appointee won only on earth that's the Pope and if you"
3360.100,3360.800," believe that"
3361.500,3364.900," you're you're you're you deserve to be treated with the pouring crudely"
3365.200,3369.300," or on the other hand if you don't believe that you deserve to be treated with a poor and cruelty"
3369.600,3373.100," you know it's just you look at any car believe it I mean"
3373.900,3374.400," you know all"
3375.300,3376.900," Jonathan Swift in in his"
3377.900,3379.000," brilliant present"
3379.400,3380.900," book you know and there's a lot of"
3381.600,3385.500," brilliant works on this actually if you look at it over the centuries people have seen this"
3386.100,3388.700," Swift in Gulliver's Travels you know he had"
3391.000,3395.600," I can't remember the Gulliver travels is a long time since I read it actually to something like four different"
3396.300,3397.100," Lands and"
3398.200,3398.700," one of them"
3399.300,3404.600," has a big I may have got this wrong but what I think I this little bit I don't think I've got wrong"
3405.100,3406.400," then on one of those lands"
3407.000,3410.800," the the two groups who live on either side of this big Island or something like that"
3411.300,3413.400," with a wall down the middle and they're constantly"
3413.900,3417.700," raiding the other side and killing them and then the other side raids back and"
3418.200,3423.200," and there's the Little Indians on one side and the big Indians on the other side"
3423.600,3425.100," little end ions"
3425.400,3427.100," big ends"
3427.700,3428.000," they"
3428.600,3429.200," disagree"
3429.800,3432.100," over which end of the egg"
3432.500,3436.000," should be eaten first whether you should break the the big end"
3436.800,3437.700," or the little end"
3440.200,3441.300," that's their disagreement"
3441.900,3443.700," and it's centuries of warfare"
3444.000,3445.300," you know and I mean actually"
3446.700,3447.900," I mean he's kind of right"
3448.200,3448.900," it is that"
3450.000,3451.800," on the face of it that ridiculous"
3452.300,3452.500," you know"
3453.000,3456.500," but but people get so caught up in the"
3457.100,3462.200," whole sort of machinery I mean physical machinery in all the sort of political machinery"
3462.800,3463.700," of warfare that"
3464.600,3466.700," they they can't take a step back"
3467.400,3468.800," they get so cold up in it"
3470.000,3470.400," you know and"
3471.000,3473.300," and the momentum in a human"
3474.000,3475.100," neurophysiology of"
3475.700,3475.800," you know"
3476.300,3477.400," they've attacked us"
3478.000,3479.900," I gotta kill every last child"
3480.600,3482.500," you know it that's what happens and"
3482.900,3484.200," and it's it's um"
3484.600,3486.300," but it's and so it becomes"
3486.900,3488.900," this sort of momentum and engine of its own"
3489.500,3491.000," but it's actually isn't really"
3491.500,3492.200," it's still"
3492.600,3495.000," humans with human neurophysiology"
3497.300,3498.700," who can actually"
3499.600,3500.400," make the decision"
3502.000,3502.400," whoa"
3503.000,3504.000," I'm going to draw breath"
3505.200,3506.200," I'm going to pause"
3509.900,3511.000," you know and and I'm going to"
3512.100,3513.300," I'm going to make the decision"
3514.500,3515.400," that this isn't right"
3516.700,3516.800," you know"
3518.800,3519.200," my"
3519.600,3521.300," wife Claire and I once went to hear"
3522.300,3523.000," the clerk"
3523.700,3525.200," you know the South African Prime Minister"
3526.200,3528.300," give a talk this was in 19"
3529.100,3531.300," in a part I started in 1948"
3531.900,3532.600," that approach"
3533.300,3533.400," of"
3534.200,3535.700," basically segregation"
3536.300,3536.400," and"
3537.100,3538.800," black South Africans having to live in"
3539.200,3540.400," particular townships"
3541.200,3542.400," which were released"
3543.100,3545.400," mercilessly you know because there are other"
3546.300,3546.600," and"
3548.800,3553.300," in 1992 or so or in the in the"
3553.600,3556.000," Years coming up around then"
3556.800,3557.500," the clerk"
3557.900,3561.100," had been a real believer in the policy of a part-time"
3561.700,3564.400," he didn't he wasn't there at the Beginning he was younger than that but"
3565.200,3568.800," but you know when he was in government he thought the this is the right thing to do well"
3570.100,3571.400," and he suddenly decided"
3572.300,3573.000," he was wrong"
3574.100,3575.200," it wasn't the right thing to do"
3576.600,3577.000," and he"
3578.300,3580.000," managed to bring his"
3580.600,3582.600," his party political party around"
3583.400,3586.200," some violently disagreed and he let them go"
3587.200,3588.000," and enough of them"
3590.400,3591.000," stayed with him"
3591.700,3593.100," that by 1994"
3593.800,3594.500," they ended"
3595.100,3595.900," a part-time"
3597.400,3599.400," they recognised it had been wrong"
3600.500,3602.900," and there were able to make the decision"
3604.200,3605.000," it's possible"
3605.700,3606.900," for humans to do that"
3607.700,3608.400," the the"
3609.700,3613.200," apparent inevitability of a momentum of cruelty"
3613.900,3616.300," if it's warfare if it's a present and occupation"
3617.200,3618.100," it isn't inevitable"
3619.100,3619.800," is people"
3620.400,3623.000," it's actually humans and it's so easy to forget that"
3623.900,3626.700," it's easy to forget that it's human beings"
3627.400,3627.800," who are"
3628.400,3628.900," patio"
3629.800,3630.000," and it's"
3630.900,3631.600," and as We Know"
3632.000,3633.100," it's so easy to forget"
3633.700,3636.100," that the people is being perpetrated on"
3637.000,3637.500," their people"
3638.300,3639.400," just Like Us"
3640.700,3642.500," whichever side it is us or them"
3643.400,3644.800," that them I just"
3645.300,3645.500," like"
3646.200,3646.400," us"
3647.800,3648.800," that just Like Us"
3649.400,3653.000," I got the same three brains as Rick Hansen puts it"
3653.300,3655.700," the reptilian brain the Maman brain"
3656.200,3657.200," the primate brain"
3658.400,3660.700," all people you know we're just one"
3661.700,3662.100," family"
3663.500,3664.800," in a bad descenders of"
3665.700,3669.100," African Eve right 45 thousand years ago whatever it was the"
3669.800,3671.900," I don't know so yeah I'm not up to date but"
3672.500,3676.700," you know when there was the bottle neck and sapiens and I think maybe only a few hundred"
3677.900,3679.400," sapiens actually still existed"
3680.400,3683.400," in East Africa or where it what wherever it was"
3684.000,3685.800," we are all we're all from that from that"
3687.200,3687.400," now"
3688.300,3689.000," provenance you know"
3689.900,3691.400," very one family"
3692.600,3694.500," you know and man you know"
3695.300,3698.100," in some ways we we show that you know some ways"
3699.900,3702.000," we just haven't hadn't figured out how to stop"
3702.300,3705.100," being so brought to each other now all of that"
3705.600,3706.800," is introductory"
3707.900,3708.500," by way of"
3709.300,3710.700," what is this original face thing"
3711.200,3712.300," and why bother about it"
3712.900,3713.300," so"
3713.900,3717.500," first of all let me give you two little stories from zen tradition"
3719.400,3719.500," um"
3722.600,3724.500," to to just sort of"
3725.000,3728.500," give a little sample of what it's placed in"
3728.900,3729.600," history and"
3730.000,3730.900," see the point is"
3732.200,3736.000," prior zen you know Buddhism spread out of India"
3736.400,3738.900," and one of the places it spread to was China"
3739.400,3741.500," and it was a long process of from about"
3742.000,3743.500," the years 0"
3744.000,3746.300," to about the fifth century CE"
3746.700,3748.400," Buddhism was seeping into China"
3749.100,3751.900," as it and it was evolving too and spreading within India"
3753.200,3754.100," and this this sort of"
3754.400,3755.400," this gradual"
3755.900,3758.500," absorption by China was going on and"
3759.100,3762.400," and what pain in basically was the was the"
3762.900,3764.100," the TERA Vada"
3764.300,3764.800," Buddhist"
3765.000,3765.400," path"
3765.900,3767.200," which by and large"
3768.200,3771.800," it does know that there can be exceptions to this but by and large"
3772.300,3772.600," it says"
3773.200,3774.900," we've got this beautiful path"
3775.300,3775.900," of training"
3776.600,3777.400," just follow it"
3778.200,3779.700," you know and you follow it in"
3780.200,3781.500," how you live"
3782.600,3786.400," you follow it in how you understand things you know and you follow it"
3787.000,3787.400," in your"
3788.300,3789.800," meditative practice"
3790.500,3792.600," and within the meditative portion"
3793.200,3796.500," there's step by step you know do this do this do this do this"
3797.300,3799.500," get this down get this down this down"
3800.300,3801.700," and it's an it's a pretty"
3803.000,3807.100," low thing and you know because they had the reincarnationist worldview"
3807.700,3811.300," there's no problem you might only do Three Steps in this lifetime and"
3811.700,3813.900," you know then you'll be around again and then you can do"
3814.800,3818.400," with through the first two and then you're going to form five and six and seven yeah"
3818.800,3823.600," there's a Long View and then eventually you'll get to this thing called Awakening"
3824.500,3826.400," and what is Awakening is when you"
3827.300,3830.700," you're you're completely liberated you're all your"
3831.200,3832.100," constructions"
3832.800,3834.200," that lead to attachments"
3834.900,3836.600," constructions of the way things are"
3837.500,3841.400," that lead to these deep attachments and fetters and bindings and"
3842.400,3844.400," all of it is blown away"
3845.300,3846.300," and there's just one"
3847.100,3848.100," Undying"
3848.300,3849.300," or deathless"
3850.400,3850.800," fact"
3851.300,3852.000," Nirvana"
3852.500,3853.400," total Freedom"
3854.100,3854.700," blowing out"
3855.300,3855.900," blowing away"
3856.400,3858.900," all blown infinitely open"
3860.500,3860.700," you know"
3863.100,3863.300," right"
3864.100,3865.000," but man is slow"
3865.300,3866.000," okay so that's"
3868.200,3868.800," a traditional"
3870.200,3871.000," early Buddhist"
3871.700,3872.100," path"
3873.100,3873.600," view"
3875.400,3876.100," and I want to just"
3876.400,3878.300," emphasise or upend"
3878.600,3879.900," that even within that view"
3880.500,3881.900," there was definitely acknowledgement"
3882.400,3883.100," that occasionally"
3884.600,3885.400," people would just get it"
3886.000,3888.700," and they wouldn't actually have gone through all that long slow process"
3889.300,3890.800," so we're going to just note that that"
3891.300,3893.600," is acknowledged within the Tara"
3893.800,3894.600," Buddhists also"
3895.800,3897.100," but in China they"
3898.100,3900.300," they had the Taoist background that was really"
3902.300,3904.100," get to see the doubt just"
3906.000,3907.100," discover the dou"
3908.300,3911.300," that's that's the that's the the reality of the Towers"
3912.100,3913.900," live in accordance with the Dow"
3914.600,3915.900," discover the Dow"
3916.400,3918.000," and others experience it personally"
3918.600,3919.500," and continue"
3920.200,3923.100," to live in accordance with it which point you're really it"
3923.400,3924.200," you are it"
3924.600,3926.200," what you are is in fact in the doubt"
3927.200,3927.300," so"
3928.200,3929.100," Chinese Buddhism"
3931.000,3934.200," at some point said okay- we've got this gradual pass"
3935.500,3935.600," but"
3936.100,3936.400," actually"
3936.900,3937.600," that's not all"
3938.000,3939.700," it's not a complete view"
3940.300,3942.400," of humans spiritual development"
3942.900,3944.400," there's another side to it"
3945.000,3947.000," which is not gradually Awakening"
3947.700,3948.400," it's sudden"
3948.800,3949.400," Awakening"
3950.300,3951.600," so suddenly seeing it"
3952.800,3953.100," and"
3954.600,3955.300," that's basically"
3956.100,3956.600," Zen"
3957.700,3957.900," and"
3960.800,3964.000," you know in a cool with that views and has a lot of stories"
3964.500,3966.200," of people suddenly seeing"
3969.600,3972.200," it and it came up with a lot of rather"
3972.900,3973.700," well either"
3974.600,3977.100," kind of frustrating all beautiful"
3977.600,3978.800," poetic expressions"
3979.600,3979.900," of"
3981.300,3983.400," what is like to suddenly see it"
3983.800,3984.500," one of them is"
3986.300,3988.700," just see your original face"
3990.500,3992.300," the face of always had"
3993.700,3994.400," since before"
3995.500,3997.100," not just you were born"
3997.900,4000.100," but before even your parents were born"
4000.600,4001.600," you have had"
4002.400,4003.400," one original"
4004.200,4004.500," face"
4006.500,4006.700," now"
4007.200,4008.400," in that phrase"
4010.500,4013.800," the there's a thing that then phrases"
4014.200,4015.100," and coan's"
4015.700,4016.000," often"
4016.800,4016.900," do"
4017.600,4020.100," is that they throw in a slightly misleading word"
4022.900,4025.800," but because they're trying to express something that can't be expressed"
4027.000,4029.700," there's no problem it's not bad to throw in a misleading word"
4030.000,4031.400," it's actually good why"
4031.900,4035.000," because we might go on to that misleading word"
4036.200,4038.000," and try to figure it out in our minds"
4039.300,4039.500," and"
4040.200,4041.500," because we're doing that"
4042.300,4043.300," it's easier"
4044.500,4045.500," for us to suddenly"
4046.800,4049.600," kinda have that that particular misleading word"
4050.400,4051.100," pulled out"
4051.600,4052.300," from under us"
4053.300,4055.200," and that might trigger a larger"
4056.200,4058.200," pulling away of the rug from underneath us"
4058.900,4062.200," that's that's sort of one way of thinking about how some kinds work"
4062.500,4063.600," so the misleading word"
4064.000,4065.200," in this particular phrase"
4065.600,4066.800," is actually the word face"
4068.900,4071.500," of trying to figure out what what face have I got well actually"
4072.800,4074.300," what what face have you got anyway"
4075.300,4076.000," how do you know you"
4076.500,4077.800," you've got a face"
4078.300,4080.000," we only know it by looking in the mirror"
4081.500,4083.800," right you can't force you can't see your face"
4085.000,4087.500," you see my other people can see it because you can see there"
4088.500,4090.600," but you don't experience your own face"
4094.100,4094.900," and that's actually"
4095.400,4096.900," a little bit of a hint"
4098.100,4100.500," a little bit of a doorway even a portal"
4101.200,4102.500," to discovering"
4102.900,4103.400," seeing"
4103.600,4104.100," the original"
4105.000,4106.700," face is always always always"
4108.300,4108.600," had"
4111.000,4111.000," so"
4113.900,4115.000," let me just ding ding ding ding"
4119.000,4123.400," I promise a little story about it I promise too let me see if I can do too many do one"
4123.900,4124.400," kill"
4124.700,4125.300," again was a"
4126.200,4127.900," ardent Zen student"
4128.500,4130.800," and he studied a lot of stuff he"
4131.500,4131.700," was"
4132.200,4133.600," kind of borderline between"
4134.300,4135.500," believing in the sudden School"
4136.300,4137.600," vs the gradual School"
4138.100,4139.600," and part of the gradual School"
4140.000,4142.400," was that you needed to not only do your"
4143.200,4147.500," your practice your meditative practice you're not only needed to live ethically"
4148.000,4152.100," you also needed to understand deeply and that meant a lot of scriptural studies so"
4152.800,4153.200," you again"
4153.700,4158.600," if the young guys very bright scholarly minded a lot of"
4159.200,4161.500," scriptures and commentaries on the scriptures"
4162.100,4163.600," and commentaries on the commentaries"
4164.000,4164.900," and he knew it all and"
4165.600,4167.500," and he went to a new Master and studied with"
4168.200,4169.400," who was more the"
4169.800,4173.000," sudden school for variety called isano Wait Shan"
4173.800,4179.200," and and he tried to he talked for hours to question and presenting his marvellous understanding"
4179.900,4180.700," and glacier and"
4181.000,4182.200," stopped him a certain point and said"
4182.700,4182.900," look"
4184.300,4185.200," you've just got to"
4185.900,4186.300," discover"
4187.100,4188.100," the answer to this question"
4188.700,4190.500," what was your original face before"
4191.000,4192.100," your parents were born"
4193.500,4193.600," so"
4194.200,4194.900," hilgen"
4195.700,4196.200," goes off"
4196.800,4201.100," and ransacked all these scriptural commentaries trying to find the answer"
4201.500,4203.400," what was my original face to follow my principal"
4203.700,4206.200," got to find it somewhere studying all this Scrolls and"
4207.500,4210.700," he's up all night searching essentially pathfind I'll find the answer"
4211.600,4213.300," goes back to the master"
4213.800,4214.700," the next day there's"
4216.100,4218.100," I haven't I haven't found the answer"
4219.000,4221.300," please tell me what is my original face"
4221.800,4222.500," and and"
4223.100,4224.800," the glacier says to him"
4225.300,4226.000," I could tell you"
4226.700,4228.000," but you wouldn't thank me later"
4230.500,4230.500," so"
4231.800,4232.200," off"
4234.000,4236.000," basically so dismisses yoga"
4236.400,4238.000," as it worked don't goes off"
4238.500,4239.400," and is very very"
4240.100,4241.000," downhearted"
4241.600,4241.700," but"
4242.100,4242.700," failing this"
4243.800,4247.200," this failing to get the answer to questions feel he's really sort of failed as a"
4247.700,4250.700," as a such a devoted practitioner you know it couldn't"
4251.100,4251.800," answer the question"
4252.600,4254.500," and he becomes an itinerant labourer"
4254.800,4255.800," and one day"
4256.500,4256.700," he's"
4257.300,4259.200," sweeping the yard of a shrine"
4259.800,4261.900," it's a famous story I know I said it before"
4262.700,4269.400," but he's sweeping the yard of the Shrine that he's he's a sort of janitor or caretaker for groundskeeper for this shrine"
4269.900,4271.000," sweeping the yard"
4271.700,4273.000," you know and one morning"
4273.500,4275.300," he just happens to Flick"
4275.800,4276.500," with his broom"
4277.200,4279.300," a little piece of broken tile"
4280.500,4282.600," and it hits a nearby"
4283.300,4285.400," stalk of big bamboo"
4286.500,4286.600," up"
4288.500,4289.700," just a little knock"
4290.500,4292.100," and he hears the sound"
4293.000,4294.000," and somehow"
4295.200,4297.600," I mean we could actually we could kind of pause it out"
4298.000,4299.500," but somehow that not"
4300.400,4301.000," and his whole"
4301.800,4302.200," world"
4302.500,4303.100," collapses"
4303.900,4305.400," his entire experience"
4305.900,4306.700," as he's known"
4307.400,4308.400," it of himself and the world"
4309.500,4310.100," collapses"
4311.900,4313.200," and at that point"
4314.500,4314.700," he"
4316.800,4317.900," sees his original face"
4319.900,4321.100," and he's overwhelmed"
4321.800,4324.000," he's weeping and sweating and trembling"
4325.300,4327.100," he takes a bath he changes his clothes"
4327.400,4328.300," he likes incense"
4329.000,4331.000," and he Bows in the direction of"
4331.800,4333.500," build wish wish and"
4334.600,4335.200," monastery"
4337.200,4338.600," and and writes a little time"
4339.100,4341.100," you know sort of thank you thank you I wonderful"
4341.900,4343.800," I forgotten everything I Have in You"
4347.800,4348.400," one knot"
4349.400,4351.000," and I forgotten everything I Have in You"
4356.200,4358.300," and he's he's freed actually"
4359.500,4361.000," and it becomes a great teacher"
4362.700,4362.900," and"
4365.900,4369.600," I mean in a certain way that's not really the right phrase it's not really that"
4370.400,4373.600," I mean he does become a sensible a great teacher but really he's just"
4374.200,4375.100," he's actually living"
4376.000,4376.800," he's seeing"
4377.300,4378.400," the constantly this"
4379.100,4379.700," this um"
4381.600,4382.900," this original face"
4383.700,4384.900," is not just"
4386.400,4388.700," sort of the the boundless openness that"
4389.400,4390.000," blue open"
4391.400,4392.200," but the inside out"
4392.700,4393.000," in him"
4393.800,4395.400," it's not only that it's also"
4396.000,4396.900," that that same"
4397.600,4398.200," boundlessness"
4399.300,4400.000," empty"
4400.900,4402.200," open boundlessness"
4402.800,4403.900," is constantly"
4404.700,4404.900," being"
4405.500,4407.000," the experience of this"
4407.500,4407.800," moment"
4408.600,4409.900," it's constantly being"
4410.700,4411.000," this"
4412.800,4414.800," so the original face is exactly"
4415.600,4416.300," you know this"
4417.000,4417.500," epochal"
4418.700,4420.600," it's beautiful cup made by different"
4421.200,4421.700," Christie"
4422.700,4423.700," with lovely coffee in it"
4424.400,4425.600," it this is the original face"
4427.100,4427.300," you know"
4427.700,4430.200," it's constantly showing itself just like this"
4432.500,4436.600," so he's he's freed he's he's in the deepest possible home wherever he goes"
4438.300,4441.300," in his his and and that's the Love part"
4443.600,4445.400," there's a there's no separation left"
4449.100,4450.100," he's perfectly free"
4450.600,4453.300," to be separate yogen with his brim stick"
4454.400,4455.600," but at the same time"
4456.200,4457.600," there is no separation left"
4472.800,4474.900," there's another story yeah of"
4478.200,4480.100," a monk who actually was"
4480.700,4481.300," a general"
4481.900,4482.500," a military"
4484.000,4487.900," and military guy in the seventh eighth century 7th century in China"
4488.800,4491.300," LED armies that slaughtered"
4491.700,4492.000," many"
4493.100,4494.500," and then had a change of heart"
4495.700,4496.900," didn't want to be doing that anymore"
4497.300,4497.900," it heard about"
4499.000,4501.200," Chan Buddhism or zen Buddhism"
4502.000,4502.800," and somehow it"
4504.200,4504.300," it"
4504.700,4506.200," rang a chord inside him"
4507.000,4507.200," and he"
4507.900,4508.900," laid down his sword"
4509.600,4511.900," and went to a monastery to start training"
4513.600,4513.900," and he"
4514.300,4516.200," you know he was sitting diligently"
4516.600,4517.800," but he couldn't"
4518.300,4518.600," quite"
4519.100,4519.400," yet"
4521.700,4525.100," he was on the gradual path you know he didn't get the sudden"
4527.400,4528.200," revelation"
4528.800,4529.900," and he therefore"
4530.900,4531.300," um"
4532.300,4533.300," was an allied"
4533.700,4535.500," and where the young monk"
4536.400,4538.500," who actually was a illiterate"
4538.700,4539.800," couldn't even read and write"
4540.600,4543.900," and also wasn't an ethnic Chinese he was from some"
4544.600,4545.800," minority in China"
4546.700,4547.700," go away noon"
4548.400,4549.000," he showed up"
4549.800,4550.100," and he"
4551.500,4556.900," somehow understood it all and got it all and the master at that time"
4557.700,4560.600," gave this sort of upstart youngster"
4561.200,4562.800," his Robe And His Bull"
4563.400,4566.600," the master took off his robe gave it to Wayne Young"
4567.300,4569.500," this ceremonial ball gave it to him"
4570.200,4575.000," and that meant he was passing on he was transmitting the dhar"
4575.200,4576.200," to weigh no"
4576.800,4578.200," and this this old general"
4578.900,4580.000," was Furious about it"
4580.700,4580.800," and"
4581.400,4583.100," when Wayne had gone off"
4583.400,4584.500," with the Roman a bowl"
4585.100,4586.500," that had been handed him"
4587.000,4587.100," he"
4588.000,4590.000," got together a little pussy to chase after"
4590.700,4593.000," waiting to go and get the Roman ball back"
4593.600,4593.700," you know"
4594.400,4599.300," and they and and meow pursued him for days running after an eventually caught up with him"
4600.800,4600.900," and"
4602.100,4603.200," and and and and and and"
4604.700,4605.900," know and said well what do you want"
4606.700,4607.300," and and"
4608.300,4611.000," and put the Roman a bowl down so you can have it"
4612.000,4613.700," and the the general suddenly"
4614.300,4614.400," when"
4615.000,4617.700," he tried to lift up the bowl in the story he couldn't lift it"
4618.600,4621.400," that's a point in the coal as you why couldn't he lift the ball"
4621.700,4621.800," but"
4622.400,4622.700," but he"
4623.400,4624.900," he actually suddenly realised"
4626.100,4627.500," that wasn't what he wanted at all"
4629.900,4630.300," he wanted"
4632.900,4634.700," the truth of his own life"
4635.500,4637.500," he wanted the deepest truth"
4638.300,4640.600," of his own life what is this"
4641.300,4642.000," experience"
4642.500,4643.500," of being alive"
4644.500,4645.100," really"
4646.900,4647.500," what is it"
4648.000,4648.400," really"
4649.900,4650.700," now we're so"
4651.700,4652.600," used to"
4653.500,4655.500," running around doing the things we do"
4656.600,4658.000," assuming that we know what"
4658.300,4659.100," what everything is"
4660.200,4661.500," but actually we haven't"
4662.800,4663.200," bought"
4663.900,4664.100," to"
4665.000,4667.800," because we we probably think deep down is not possible to"
4668.700,4672.300," but we we and maybe there's some two things that actually but"
4672.900,4676.200," we haven't paused and stopped as they were what actually"
4676.800,4678.000," is this life"
4678.600,4679.200," and who"
4679.700,4681.200," really am I"
4682.200,4683.600," what's going on here"
4686.000,4687.700," you know I've made this assumption"
4688.600,4690.400," from somewhere early on in childhood"
4691.100,4694.200," are made this assumption that I'm a me in here"
4695.000,4698.600," the perceiver receiver of experience a perceiver of experience"
4699.200,4703.100," trying to be an agent of life and so sort of roughly steer at the way I think I want"
4704.100,4707.700," and then as the world out there and everything including my body actually is out there"
4708.300,4710.000," compared to the real cool me"
4710.600,4711.800," you know and and I'm trying to"
4712.700,4718.100," make all these things work the way I want and not go the way I don't want and I'm in here and they're all out there"
4718.800,4719.500," but actually"
4720.300,4723.300," just in terms of actual experience"
4724.600,4725.900," there's a lot of assumptions in"
4726.800,4728.100," there there's a lot of ideas"
4729.700,4731.900," and two really big ideas"
4732.800,4734.200," that come to dominate"
4735.200,4736.200," our understanding"
4737.100,4738.700," that I am a thing"
4739.900,4740.300," and that"
4741.800,4743.000," I'm everything else"
4743.800,4744.500," that's not me"
4745.400,4746.300," I'm separate from"
4747.900,4750.200," and it's out there and I'm in here"
4751.100,4754.200," but and we just it becomes such an entrenched view"
4754.900,4758.200," that it's very difficult to see that it's only an idea"
4759.300,4760.700," or a couple of ideas"
4762.600,4764.300," melded into a single system"
4767.000,4767.400," but actually"
4768.300,4769.300," if we stopped"
4770.000,4770.100," and"
4770.700,4773.900," just kind of allow ourselves to"
4774.700,4775.300," look"
4777.700,4778.500," we see that"
4778.800,4780.100," it's really not accurate"
4780.900,4782.100," it's really not accurate"
4782.600,4784.400," they're actually is no evidence"
4785.000,4785.800," of this me"
4786.400,4786.900," in here"
4789.200,4791.600," when we look for it in actual experience"
4792.700,4793.500," we can't find it"
4796.500,4797.300," and when we look"
4797.700,4799.600," for the world out there"
4800.300,4801.400," being separate"
4802.500,4803.300," from the awareness"
4803.800,4804.900," the experiencing it"
4805.700,4806.100," we also"
4806.900,4808.000," actually can't find"
4808.700,4811.500," evidence of actual objectivity out there"
4812.400,4815.400," it's all experience is all awareness"
4817.100,4817.500," basically"
4818.400,4818.500," and"
4821.000,4821.900," Wayne Young"
4822.400,4824.500," had seen it and there's monk"
4824.900,4825.600," the old general"
4826.200,4826.700," hadn't"
4829.100,4829.200," and"
4830.600,4832.500," he somehow though"
4833.200,4833.800," trusted"
4834.600,4835.600," that there was something"
4836.200,4836.900," to be found"
4838.200,4840.300," some really different way"
4841.100,4841.700," of experiencing"
4843.100,4843.900," his own life"
4845.600,4845.800," and"
4846.500,4848.100," so much so that you know"
4849.200,4850.200," he was prepared to"
4851.200,4852.400," quit what had been doing"
4853.200,4853.800," in the army"
4854.500,4855.600," join the Monastery"
4856.300,4859.000," and even do this crazy thing of chasing after"
4859.800,4860.600," a young monk"
4861.100,4862.600," a non monk sorry the Young"
4863.500,4866.600," labour actually working in the Monastery the rice shed"
4867.600,4867.800," and"
4868.700,4869.800," when he had been-- given this"
4871.100,4874.500," Insignia of office really by the old master"
4875.700,4877.100," he was desperate for it"
4878.000,4878.000," but"
4878.500,4881.200," what at that moment when when I stopped him"
4882.600,4883.600," said you can have the ball"
4884.700,4885.600," and the room by the"
4886.500,4886.500," fish"
4887.800,4889.000," that moment he realised"
4889.400,4890.800," no that's not what I really want"
4891.600,4892.800," want I do really want something"
4893.400,4894.000," it's not that"
4895.500,4897.000," it's at what I really know"
4897.800,4898.400," who I am"
4899.100,4900.100," I want to experience"
4901.100,4903.000," what is this life"
4903.500,4904.000," really"
4905.400,4906.300," and right then"
4907.100,4909.500," Wayne and poses the question what"
4909.900,4911.500," is your original face"
4912.000,4914.300," at the very moment of running after me"
4915.500,4916.800," what was your original face"
4917.500,4918.300," but somehow"
4921.000,4923.800," meow this whole general suddenly"
4924.400,4925.100," he gets it"
4925.900,4927.500," who knows why who knows"
4927.900,4928.700," how and why"
4929.100,4930.300," except that it's always present"
4931.400,4932.900," and it's but for him that question"
4934.500,4934.800," kind of"
4936.400,4937.000," liked him open"
4937.400,4937.700," or whatever"
4938.300,4938.400," it"
4938.800,4940.000," ended the construction"
4940.800,4941.800," but I'm in here"
4942.400,4943.300," and the world's out there"
4944.300,4945.500," and and and and"
4946.800,4947.500," that that"
4947.800,4949.600," construction of reality"
4951.200,4952.300," the question just"
4952.400,4953.400," cut through it somehow"
4954.000,4954.800," and it collapsed"
4955.300,4956.100," and he too"
4956.500,4957.400," is standing"
4958.800,4959.400," and as everything"
4960.600,4961.700," but there's nothing as well"
4962.500,4963.800," a boundless openness"
4964.700,4967.600," and and and he's shaking and"
4968.100,4971.100," sweating and weeping because it's very it's a very strong"
4972.100,4976.700," sort of overwhelming thing if it's if it happens in a strong weighs very strong you know it's a"
4977.400,4978.400," kind of overwhelming and"
4979.400,4985.800," and and in these and he says you know all these years I've been training and I never saw it and now I've seen it and thank you thank you and"
4986.500,4990.800," and Wayne to sort of there's no no don't there's nothing to do with me you know"
4991.400,4992.800," nothing to do with me you know"
4993.000,4994.200," which is true you know"
4994.900,4995.100," and"
4997.000,4997.300," and"
4998.000,5000.100," and and their friends again"
5001.300,5001.900," no problem"
5002.300,5002.800," you know"
5003.500,5003.700," um"
5004.800,5005.800," so it's worth it"
5007.800,5012.400," because because of the Beauty and The Wonder and the overwhelming sort of"
5015.600,5016.200," easing"
5017.200,5020.500," and the human heart is is so fulfilled by it it's all"
5021.400,5021.800," ah"
5022.100,5022.800," it's all ok"
5023.300,5024.000," it's all okay"
5024.600,5024.700," and"
5030.700,5032.900," yeah let's just have a little moment actually just"
5034.900,5035.900," to be with some of this"
5037.300,5038.900," the story of kilgen"
5043.800,5045.000," hearing that knock"
5049.900,5051.600," man the story of the old general"
5054.800,5056.400," being stopped in his tracks"
5057.300,5058.200," by the question"
5060.400,5061.400," what's your original"
5062.000,5062.500," face"
5067.300,5068.300," there's something"
5069.600,5071.000," that's always been here"
5076.600,5078.000," and the wonderful thing is when we"
5079.000,5082.600," when when you know when when it shows itself when it"
5083.200,5085.100," when the world opens and"
5085.800,5087.300," reveals it so to speak"
5088.300,5092.500," we realise why it's always been here always always"
5094.300,5095.200," because on"
5095.900,5097.500," in its world"
5098.800,5100.200," there isn't any time"
5102.900,5105.300," it turns out that in some sense time"
5105.900,5106.500," is also"
5107.200,5107.900," a construction"
5110.700,5111.200," an idea"
5118.800,5120.500," so then I'm going to bring in one more story"
5121.800,5122.600," at a chara"
5123.300,5123.400," whose"
5123.900,5124.700," sitting right next to me"
5125.300,5128.000," this is a sculpt sculpture or statue of patacha"
5129.200,5129.600," beautiful"
5130.000,5130.500," and she"
5131.400,5133.200," went through this terrible loss"
5134.900,5137.000," catastrophic loss early in life"
5137.200,5138.300," she"
5138.800,5140.700," well as a young adult she had a"
5141.100,5143.000," she had a difficult time she fell in love with"
5144.100,5145.200," somebody that her"
5145.900,5148.700," father didn't want her to marry and and ran away"
5149.700,5151.300," and married the guy she wanted and then"
5153.600,5155.700," she became she had one child and"
5156.100,5156.500," and then"
5156.900,5157.500," she she"
5161.100,5164.800," well the story is actually that when she was pregnant with the second child"
5165.500,5168.800," she she wanted to go back to home to her parents"
5169.700,5173.100," with her husband with her first child with a new infant"
5173.800,5178.200," and began the journey by herself the husband refused to go and she went by herself"
5179.300,5182.600," and and then her husband followed and she went into labour"
5183.600,5185.000," on the journey and her husband"
5185.900,5191.100," is a little bit like sort of Jesus and Mary I shall not thinking she's she's about to have a child her husband"
5192.000,5192.300," has to"
5192.800,5196.200," she tells him pretty good to go and find some shelters so"
5197.100,5200.000," so he went he went he goes in search of some wood"
5201.000,5201.200," and"
5201.900,5207.100," because a heavy storm is just hit the place so she's he's going to try to find some wood to build a shelter"
5207.600,5210.900," but he gets bitten by poisonous snake and died instantly"
5211.700,5216.000," meanwhile she gives birth out and forest and the next morning she finds her dead husband"
5217.100,5219.100," and blames herself for his death"
5219.800,5220.200," and then"
5221.700,5226.900," she continues her journey to get home to her parents and comes to this river"
5227.300,5228.700," the achilla vatti river"
5229.400,5232.100," and it was overflowing because of the same storm"
5233.000,5237.300," unable to wait across with both children she left the older child on the shore"
5237.800,5240.100," and carried the baby across to the other Shore"
5240.600,5242.800," before returning to get her first son"
5243.300,5245.300," when she was halfway through coming back"
5246.200,5247.100," of vulture"
5247.900,5250.400," throughput on the baby and flew off with it"
5251.400,5251.700," hearing"
5252.500,5253.600," his mother screaming"
5254.200,5255.300," the Elder son"
5256.100,5257.800," believes patachara was calling him"
5258.200,5259.400," and entered the water"
5260.100,5262.600," he was swept away by the strong current"
5263.400,5264.100," so she had lost"
5264.600,5265.400," both her children"
5266.200,5267.400," and her husband"
5268.100,5269.400," the husband to a snake"
5270.100,5271.600," the infant to a vulture"
5272.500,5273.100," the second"
5273.700,5274.700," the first child"
5275.500,5276.200," to River"
5276.700,5277.300," in Spate"
5278.100,5279.200," she was devastated"
5279.800,5281.300," she actually continued to the city"
5281.700,5285.000," in Hope of meeting her parents but on her way she was informed that her parents"
5285.400,5286.100," and brother"
5286.600,5287.700," had also been-- killed"
5288.200,5289.800," in the cataclysmic storm"
5290.500,5291.000," that had"
5291.500,5292.300," destroyed their house"
5293.300,5296.800," so she was completely shattered and utterly depressed she became insane"
5297.500,5300.700," and then she crazily started to scream and undressed herself"
5301.800,5305.400," the people used to throw stones of her call her crazy woman and tortured her"
5305.900,5308.300," and nobody recognised who she previously was"
5309.300,5311.700," she grew more aggressive and saying day by day"
5314.100,5314.600," and became"
5315.300,5318.200," completely ostracized from the village"
5318.800,5320.200," and then somehow"
5321.000,5322.500," she she she"
5323.200,5324.700," she came to the Buddha"
5325.400,5327.000," she found her way to the Buddha"
5327.700,5327.900," and"
5329.200,5330.000," and the Buddha"
5331.000,5331.400," actually"
5332.400,5333.300," he just said"
5336.700,5340.100," excuse me just one second I'm just going to pull it up he he said"
5344.100,5347.700," yeah after running through the city civati naked and disconsolate"
5348.400,5351.200," she prostrated herself at the feet of the Buddha"
5351.700,5353.700," describing her family tragedies"
5354.700,5356.200," and the Buddha"
5356.500,5357.300," said to her"
5357.900,5358.400," simply"
5363.600,5364.900," yeah when she actually went to"
5366.800,5370.400," when she arrived were the Buddha was teaching there's a slightly different button"
5370.900,5372.400," the monks wanted to send her away"
5373.200,5375.000," but the Buddha stopped them and said to her"
5376.000,5376.400," sister"
5377.100,5378.600," recover your presence of mind"
5382.600,5383.500," at his words"
5384.300,5385.800," she regained her sanity"
5386.800,5388.100," and realised she was naked"
5389.100,5390.700," a man through her his cloak"
5391.400,5392.300," and she covered herself"
5393.400,5395.200," she told the Buddha of her tragedies"
5395.700,5397.500," and begged him to help her"
5398.200,5398.600," he said"
5399.400,5400.400," I can't help you"
5401.600,5403.000," for countless lives"
5403.500,5404.200," you have wept"
5404.800,5405.700," for your loved ones"
5406.600,5407.200," your tears"
5407.700,5409.800," could fill before oceans"
5411.000,5413.000," but no one can be secure"
5413.900,5417.000," but no one can be a secure hiding place"
5417.600,5418.200," from suffering"
5418.900,5419.600," knowing this"
5420.500,5421.700," a wise person"
5422.100,5424.000," walks the path of awaken"
5425.100,5427.800," there is no safe place from sough"
5428.400,5430.600," there is no place safe from suffer"
5431.200,5432.700," knowing this a wise person"
5433.500,5435.200," walks the path of Awakening"
5435.800,5438.000," over countless lifetimes your tears"
5439.400,5440.000," have filled"
5440.900,5441.600," bought oceans"
5443.400,5445.000," his words he's her mind"
5446.300,5447.800," she became a monastic"
5448.200,5449.300," and practiced diligently"
5450.300,5453.600," and one day she saw into the nature of impermanence"
5455.500,5456.600," and the Buddha"
5457.100,5459.600," appeared in a vision and said Pat a chara"
5460.300,5461.700," all human beings die"
5462.600,5466.500," it is better to see the truth of impermanence even for just a moment"
5467.300,5468.700," than to live for a hundred years"
5469.500,5470.100," and not know"
5471.300,5472.600," but the chara Awakened"
5473.100,5475.100," became the greatest of the women teachers"
5475.800,5477.000," in the Buddha's Sanger"
5478.500,5478.600," so"
5480.500,5481.400," this is why"
5482.200,5482.900," it's worth it"
5483.800,5485.600," this is why it's worth"
5487.400,5487.800," practice"
5488.800,5492.600," it's not actually just about stress reduction"
5493.400,5495.100," it's not just about"
5499.500,5500.200," aiming"
5500.900,5502.400," a rattled nervous system"
5504.800,5507.100," it is those things and that's great and we don't"
5508.700,5509.000," sort of"
5510.100,5513.200," what's the word we we don't disdain them at all"
5514.100,5514.600," it's great"
5515.300,5515.900," practice has"
5516.400,5517.400," multifold benefits"
5518.500,5519.500," but at the heart of it"
5521.100,5521.300," it's"
5521.900,5522.900," it's something more"
5524.200,5524.700," it's something"
5525.500,5529.500," more and less it's it's about"
5530.200,5530.500," just"
5531.400,5531.700," seeing"
5532.400,5534.300," through the way we construct the world"
5535.100,5537.200," and we can because our construction"
5538.100,5540.200," of the world is actually also"
5541.000,5541.600," arising"
5542.200,5543.400," in what has no construction"
5544.300,5545.500," and what has no construction"
5546.100,5547.100," is the original face"
5547.800,5549.300," and what the original face is"
5549.800,5551.300," is always right"
5551.800,5552.000," here"
5553.100,5556.600," I was talking earlier about like the theatre space the stage in the theatre"
5557.400,5558.600," well okay kind of"
5559.200,5559.800," but I actually"
5560.600,5560.800," better"
5561.300,5562.200," you know imagine"
5563.300,5566.500," all your experiences in a wider bigger Theatre"
5566.800,5568.800," and then you can really just forget the theatre"
5569.500,5569.600," just"
5570.900,5571.500," boundlessness"
5572.700,5573.800," and and and and"
5575.200,5578.400," and and the thing about it is actually this phrase"
5579.000,5581.200," seeing into impermanence"
5582.500,5583.900," understanding in permanence"
5585.000,5586.100," it's a tricky phrase"
5587.400,5588.300," because impermanence"
5589.300,5590.100," we think it means"
5592.500,5593.200," all things"
5594.300,5595.100," arise"
5595.900,5597.100," are around for a while"
5598.100,5599.000," and then are gone"
5601.100,5602.500," all we might think a little more"
5603.500,5604.000," dialled in"
5604.700,5605.200," all things"
5605.800,5607.100," are constantly arising"
5608.000,5609.000," constantly changing"
5609.900,5611.100," and constantly disappearing"
5613.000,5614.100," and that is true of"
5615.100,5616.300," you know the the cup"
5617.400,5618.800," is true of the Mountains"
5619.400,5621.900," it's true of the Continents is true of this planet"
5622.600,5625.600," is true of this solar system is true this universe"
5626.400,5629.300," going to be a constant change state of arising"
5630.100,5630.600," changing"
5631.100,5631.700," disappearing"
5633.700,5636.100," all we you know but here's the thing"
5638.300,5640.800," in the in seeing the original face"
5644.600,5646.000,"weirdly um"
5648.900,5649.500," one"
5650.000,5650.500," face of it"
5650.800,5651.700," is that you see"
5653.300,5655.500," everything is nothing but a state of flux"
5656.700,5658.100," there is absolutely no"
5659.500,5664.100," sort of solidity to it is just things arising and disappearing arising and disappearing"
5664.800,5666.200," a little bit like a lava lamp"
5666.700,5666.900," you know"
5667.400,5669.600," it can show up that way so he's just see the"
5670.100,5673.100," it's all kind of blooming and gone and blooming and gone"
5673.700,5675.100," all sometimes it's like a"
5676.000,5678.600," it's more like a sort of pixelated field of"
5679.200,5683.000," things appearing gone and it's very sort of energised actually"
5683.800,5687.300," all sometimes it's like a river of Quicksilver of lightning"
5687.900,5689.200," and you know there's there's a"
5689.800,5690.500," there's a great"
5691.700,5693.600," that description"
5693.900,5694.300," you know the"
5695.200,5695.500," in the"
5696.400,5699.800," early terravida scriptures the party cannon as one that says"
5700.300,5701.100," you know things are"
5701.700,5703.500," all things are"
5703.900,5705.100," like a bubble on a stream"
5706.000,5707.100," or they're like"
5707.900,5709.900," a foam on a river or then like a"
5710.300,5712.900," mirage over a hot filled or they're like a"
5713.400,5716.200," magicians Conjuring trick in a marketplace"
5716.800,5717.900," or they're like a"
5719.900,5720.600," what's the other one"
5721.000,5722.800," they're like a plantain tree"
5723.300,5725.000," where you keep pulling away the fronts"
5725.900,5729.200," and there's no trunk there as there's nothing in the middle just fronds you know"
5729.900,5730.800," all things are like that"
5733.200,5733.300," but"
5733.900,5736.300," but but but when this"
5738.100,5739.600," Awakening to original face"
5741.000,5742.900," you know when it happens we actually"
5743.900,5745.100," also can see"
5745.900,5747.200," that there really isn't any"
5752.700,5753.300," there's just this"
5758.000,5758.600," and even the"
5759.300,5760.900," even impermanence is an idea"
5763.400,5764.000," that's just this"
5765.100,5765.900," in a certain way"
5766.800,5767.600," impermanence"
5768.200,5768.900," is gone"
5772.300,5772.900," and so there's"
5773.900,5774.800," there's somehow"
5776.300,5780.000," that is a level of our experience where there's nothing but"
5780.800,5781.400," safety"
5784.000,5785.500," there's nothing but love"
5789.200,5790.300,"there's the safety"
5791.400,5793.400," of their being no impermanence"
5794.500,5795.600," and there's the love"
5796.700,5797.400," of everything"
5798.500,5799.200," arising"
5799.700,5800.400," appearing"
5800.900,5801.400," being given"
5803.000,5803.700," the very same"
5804.800,5805.900," thing that is nothing"
5807.000,5807.500," is also"
5809.100,5809.400," being"
5811.800,5813.200," everything and we're just part of it"
5814.100,5816.200," we're just inextricably part of"
5816.800,5817.400," all of that"
5819.100,5819.700," and and"
5820.600,5821.300," therefore"
5822.000,5822.400," original"
5823.000,5823.300," love"
5824.600,5825.400," originating"
5826.100,5826.300," love"
5856.000,5856.400," okay"
5857.000,5857.500," um"
5861.600,5864.000," okay I'm just having a quick look at the chat"
5881.400,5882.600," yeah okay um"
5883.000,5886.900," I'm gonna there's a question how do you spell the student's name I'm just going to put that in the chat"
5888.700,5889.300," kill again"
5889.900,5890.100," and"
5891.800,5892.600," yeah so let's see"
5893.700,5896.900," I I I I think we should you know"
5899.600,5902.600," sort of partly think we should want to just sort of sit a bit and"
5903.300,5903.900," because I was a big"
5904.800,5905.100," I said"
5905.600,5908.700," I'm sorry I you know there's quite a big download I think"
5909.500,5910.900," that's just give you a moment to"
5912.300,5913.100," just kind of big"
5913.400,5913.700," be with"
5914.600,5914.900," yourself"
5916.700,5917.300," be with this"
5919.000,5919.600," be with here"
5920.300,5920.900," be here"
5921.400,5921.600," be"
5922.600,5922.800," here"
5925.000,5925.600," don't be here"
5926.600,5926.800," be"
5927.700,5928.300," here"
5971.300,5971.800," I think"
5973.000,5973.900," if anybody would"
5974.800,5975.700," like to ask a question"
5977.800,5978.800," you can raise your hand"
5980.000,5980.400," and"
5982.800,5984.000," I think I saw a"
5985.100,5987.000," question in the chat I'm just going to take a look at that"
5987.600,5988.500," okay I'm"
5990.000,5990.400," Pallion"
5992.100,5993.500," these are unmute"
5995.100,5995.500," if you can"
5997.200,6001.100," is it can you put your video on is that possible or not no one's original"
6001.600,6003.000," yes it's possible"
6003.300,6004.200," I can turn it on"
6005.000,6005.200," okay"
6005.700,6006.000," hi"
6006.900,6007.500," nice to see oh"
6010.700,6015.000," so my question is the thought it's actually"
6016.900,6017.500," thought in a question"
6018.700,6018.800," so"
6019.300,6022.200," when you are talking about Saturn Awakening"
6024.700,6025.600," it's seems like"
6027.400,6029.000," it's happening to"
6029.800,6031.500," these people who are already"
6032.100,6033.000," doing a lot of"
6033.700,6034.500," internal"
6034.800,6035.500," searching"
6036.700,6040.600," questioning and this wrestling"
6041.300,6043.200," all right I don't think it happens"
6044.100,6045.100," for someone who is"
6045.600,6046.800," not doing that"
6047.500,6048.600," constant work"
6049.400,6050.500," all right it is"
6051.200,6052.200," would you say it's true"
6052.900,6053.100," or"
6054.000,6058.100," yeah that's a that's a great question um and it's something that people have"
6059.100,6060.400," have thought about quite a lot"
6061.100,6061.400," there are"
6062.200,6064.900," certainly cases where people have done no practice"
6065.300,6066.000," suddenly have"
6067.000,6068.900," this kind of experience"
6070.800,6074.100," but what are the conditions for that we don't really know you know there's"
6074.500,6075.700," I've listened to"
6076.400,6078.500," you know I imagine many of you will know"
6078.900,6079.700," Alan Watts"
6080.000,6082.600," you know his his his his his talks and"
6083.000,6084.300," there's somewhere in there"
6085.100,6089.200," I haven't there are hundreds of them I think and I've listened to quite a lot but"
6089.500,6092.000," no way near all of them not even half of them by any means"
6092.700,6093.400," but but he does"
6094.100,6094.900," I've heard him say"
6095.700,6096.700," a few times that"
6098.200,6099.000," it happens"
6099.500,6100.700," that you know people"
6101.600,6102.300," suddenly have"
6103.800,6105.400," an Awakening experience meaning"
6106.100,6109.400," and experienced that suddenly they see they're not what they thought they were"
6110.100,6112.400," and therefore the world isn't what they thought it was"
6113.300,6115.900," and their relationships in the world isn't what they thought it was"
6116.300,6117.500," and he says somewhere"
6118.100,6119.900," that he thinks it's it's it"
6122.800,6123.600," amongst the"
6124.500,6127.900," you know whatever the the stories of that happening there seem to be a"
6128.800,6129.900," higher than average"
6130.700,6134.200," Rapunzel of Adolescent people in Adolescents so young people"
6135.000,6137.500," that maybe in Adolescents people are"
6138.300,6138.800," I don't know"
6139.500,6144.000," there's so many things that changing inside them anyway that there may be perhaps they're more open"
6144.900,6147.100," you know or something like that can happen or easily"
6147.600,6148.600," certainly in my"
6149.000,6152.200," role as a Zen teacher I met a number of people who"
6152.800,6153.600," had had"
6154.200,6154.700," a sudden"
6155.400,6155.900," Awakening"
6156.500,6156.500," and"
6157.300,6158.500," and that had"
6159.000,6161.300," not been the end of their past"
6161.600,6162.200," of practice"
6162.800,6166.300," at all it had been the thing that got them onto a part of practice"
6166.700,6167.600," because they realised"
6169.400,6169.900," there was something"
6171.300,6171.800," to discover"
6173.100,6176.700," but they needed some kind of practice to integrate it"
6177.500,6178.200," and you know"
6178.800,6182.400," so it that was the thing that precipitated that beginning"
6182.900,6186.900," a path of practice so am I also kind of you know it's only"
6188.200,6193.500," it's only my impression and you know is that it is definitely possible actually without practice"
6194.200,6195.300," but I think it's probably"
6197.600,6198.700," very hard"
6199.100,6199.100," to"
6202.600,6204.900," to kind of well to integrate it"
6205.100,6206.200," to have it become"
6207.500,6208.200," part of ones"
6209.200,6211.000," ordinary daily experience"
6211.800,6212.900," without practice"
6215.900,6215.900," so"
6216.500,6217.000," either way"
6218.100,6219.200," we're going to need to do"
6220.200,6221.400," the gradual training"
6221.900,6222.300," I think"
6224.000,6227.900," and I know there's probably some spiritual teachers who disagree with that but"
6233.700,6234.500," thanks for the question"
6235.000,6235.200," yeah"
6236.200,6236.700," hi Elizabeth"
6239.000,6240.600," yeah I can't hear you yet"
6241.400,6242.300," yeah okay great"
6242.700,6243.000," do you hear me"
6243.700,6243.800," yeah"
6244.300,6244.500," hi"
6244.900,6245.000," yeah"
6245.800,6249.300," well you kind of just answered my question in a way um"
6249.800,6251.800," because I feel like I've had"
6252.700,6253.200," certain just"
6253.900,6256.000," certain awareness is just being really"
6257.600,6260.200," one bright pearl or just this or"
6260.800,6262.200," love or you know"
6262.900,6267.800," but what happens is I get it it gets a little scary but you were just saying it takes practice"
6268.600,6269.100," to maintain"
6269.800,6269.900," that"
6270.900,6271.100," and"
6272.800,6273.900," did you feel afraid"
6275.500,6275.900," when you were"
6277.200,6277.500," first"
6278.400,6278.800," having these"
6279.500,6280.200," awarenesses"
6281.200,6281.400," of"
6283.300,6284.300," boundlessness or"
6285.000,6286.500," what is that really mean to me"
6287.900,6290.700," because I mean yeah yeah yeah"
6292.800,6299.500,"yeah what is that really mean to me that's a good question yeah did you see that I think that's the point is that in the"
6299.900,6303.400," in the instant of it or in the in the when it's when it's open"
6304.500,6306.300," you know there isn't a me"
6307.100,6309.400," okay that's not really up"
6310.600,6312.400," there isn't the me to be worried about it"
6312.700,6313.400," you know I I was"
6314.000,6317.800," yeah I mean I think it happens differently for for all of us you know and"
6318.600,6322.000," but you know I had the first time it happened to me"
6323.100,6328.100," I owe it was just it was just such an overwhelming sense of belonging"
6329.100,6330.300," and homecoming and"
6331.000,6333.100," and finding the truths"
6333.800,6336.300," you know and I was just so amazed that"
6338.300,6338.700," that"
6339.900,6342.100," this this truth could be true"
6342.500,6344.900," you know kind of thing that I was I was just"
6346.100,6349.700," based in a Kind of Love You Know and so there wasn't fear"
6350.700,6355.600," but I have to say that it's later I got very I had a really hard time"
6356.000,6356.100," you know"
6356.700,6361.600," some years I had no practice and no idea what I was what it all was and"
6362.300,6370.700," it was very it was I mean I I it's a it's a complex story what is is there's just it wasn't just it it was like facing"
6371.600,6374.500," an examined trauma that really overwhelmed"
6375.000,6375.700," and and stuff"
6376.700,6377.800," alright I read your book"
6378.300,6378.800," actually"
6383.900,6384.600," yeah okay"
6385.300,6391.000," so I I really think the wisest thing that I've I can imagine is that you need both"
6391.800,6392.200," you need"
6392.600,6393.400," agile practice"
6394.100,6395.700," because that'll help prepare you"
6396.600,6401.300," and it's and if you have a big glimpse a big opening"
6401.700,6404.200," it'll help you be with it and integrate"
6405.000,6407.100," the learn to to to"
6408.000,6411.400," live the beautiful the beauty that it opens up you know"
6412.300,6418.300," so I I just think it's it's wise to do both so to be open to both sides of practice yeah"
6418.700,6418.800," yeah"
6419.200,6421.100," okay I'm just going to have a quick look in the chat"
6427.100,6432.900," you know what's left when there's nothing so my mind that when it's filled with the idea of Wonder okay lovely lovely"
6433.300,6434.900," I'm just looking for questions right now"
6436.100,6437.700," sorry three new ones um"
6440.900,6442.100," actually I'm not seeing"
6442.400,6446.300," oh yeah after an awaken experience is pure common practice that recommended path"
6446.700,6449.300," another particular order of special way to do it"
6449.700,6450.000," um"
6450.700,6451.200," so"
6453.700,6454.500," yeah in"
6454.900,6455.700," I mean"
6457.900,6458.700," in Samos"
6459.800,6465.200," if if there's if someone's working one on one with a teacher they there's there is a"
6465.700,6467.600," you know an opening experience"
6468.500,6470.000," the teacher would discern you know"
6470.600,6473.600," if it's time to start doing more coax and it might be"
6474.400,6478.500," and yeah there is a sequence we work through certain books of coins"
6478.700,6479.800," old ancient collections"
6482.400,6486.800," but you know it must remember really that while we're doing that we're still sitting"
6487.400,6488.200," you know still doing"
6489.100,6489.600," you know whether it's"
6490.900,6493.800," half an hour an hour or hour and a half a sitting every day"
6494.500,6495.100," that's still"
6495.900,6497.800," the bedrock of what's going on"
6498.700,6501.000," and yes there may be a co-op as well"
6501.500,6503.200," and then another cone and then another comment"
6503.900,6504.100," but"
6504.400,6505.100," actually the"
6505.700,6506.500," biggest thing is that"
6507.200,6508.700," you got a daily sitting practice"
6510.800,6512.000," and that's the"
6516.200,6520.400," best that's that's that's I don't know I was gonna say the path but it's"
6521.300,6525.800," somehow that makes it sound like it's some sort of thread in life it's the place where"
6526.600,6527.200," you get to"
6527.700,6528.400," just be"
6529.400,6530.100," be with"
6531.900,6533.600," with you your own existence"
6536.800,6537.500," okay let's"
6538.300,6539.700," go to Dana"
6540.200,6540.400," hi"
6540.900,6541.500," can you unmute"
6547.600,6549.400," I'm not actually hearing you right now yeah"
6549.900,6550.300," sorry yeah"
6550.700,6551.700," hi hi"
6554.300,6556.500," I found it really interesting when you said that"
6556.900,6557.700," a Cohan"
6558.800,6562.300," like the original face often has a single word that can kind of"
6562.700,6563.700," trip you up a little bit"
6564.800,6565.000," and"
6566.100,6567.000," be holding it's"
6567.400,6567.900," essence"
6569.100,6571.200," and the original face that we"
6573.400,6575.000," tell today during the set"
6576.600,6578.100," I was taking it quite literally"
6579.600,6581.100," and having flickers of"
6582.100,6583.500," faces of mine from"
6584.700,6585.600," childhood and"
6586.800,6588.500," other visions that I could actually see"
6590.100,6593.400," and you've made this opening and you said maybe it's not a face at all"
6594.900,6596.900," and it was really beautiful I actually"
6597.700,6600.100," suddenly just saw an endless desert"
6601.900,6602.200," it"
6602.900,6604.400," didn't end it was an infinite"
6604.700,6605.500," amount of sand"
6606.800,6607.700," that I was somehow"
6608.400,6608.700," part"
6609.100,6610.800," of an infinite sand landscape"
6612.200,6614.600," and the thing that I felt viscerally was"
6618.300,6619.300," it was timeless"
6619.900,6623.900," and had nothing to do with a face that it was just the essence of all humanity"
6625.600,6628.300," that was integrated into the boundless desert"
6629.000,6630.400," it's really a beautiful"
6631.300,6631.600," Vision"
6632.400,6632.700," so"
6635.500,6636.300," it was great to"
6636.800,6637.100," take the"
6637.900,6638.600," face out of it"
6640.500,6641.800," and thank you for sharing that"
6642.300,6643.000," I want to just"
6644.000,6650.000," tune in a little bit I think I can resonate very much with something similar that I I I've experienced too"
6650.600,6651.300," very similar"
6651.700,6654.100," and but I wonder is it part of it that"
6655.000,6658.600," in a way it's not just a vision is not just the seeing you're sensing that"
6659.000,6660.500," somehow that's what you are"
6662.100,6662.800," is that right"
6663.600,6664.600," yeah part of"
6666.300,6666.500," yeah"
6668.000,6669.100," and it goes on forever"
6669.700,6670.600," and it has no time"
6671.200,6671.300," yeah"
6671.900,6673.000," and that's what we are"
6674.600,6678.900," that's this I'm very body it almost is that landscape yeah"
6679.500,6682.000," oh so just an endless boundless"
6683.700,6684.300," openness"
6685.100,6686.000," yes yes"
6686.500,6687.600," thank you so much for sharing that"
6688.200,6689.400," yeah thank you"
6690.300,6692.900," Zach hi just I think this will be the last"
6693.300,6695.800," last question yeah or sharing yeah"
6698.500,6698.900," hey Henry"
6699.300,6699.800," I'm"
6700.600,6705.700," thank you for that that was wonderful I I I loved the chat I wanted to start by"
6706.600,6708.600," what to share and I have a question and"
6709.700,6717.000," the sharing is I've been meditating and practicing and and being in this space for a year or so and"
6719.200,6721.000," as wondering thinking to myself"
6722.300,6723.500," and what is the evidence"
6724.300,6724.500," that"
6725.000,6725.300," that"
6725.900,6728.200," in some way shape or form you know"
6729.300,6731.700," that this is having an impact that this is"
6732.800,6735.100," that I'm making progress that's let's say that"
6736.000,6742.800," and we're having a windy day today out here in the UK and I was looking out of the window this morning and and"
6743.800,6744.700," I just noticed"
6745.300,6745.800," the number of"
6746.800,6747.300," bits of"
6748.200,6750.100," three and leaf and grass"
6751.000,6752.200," moving in the wind"
6753.000,6753.200," and"
6754.000,6754.800," there was a sense"
6755.300,6756.000," of joy"
6757.900,6758.900," noticing that"
6759.500,6761.100," and a sense almost that it was"
6762.500,6762.800," me"
6763.700,6765.200," I I was moving"
6765.900,6768.300," I was feeling the movement I was feeling the wind"
6768.900,6769.800," and I thought it myself"
6771.000,6772.400," if that severed and sort of"
6772.900,6775.600," that if anything must be evident of the"
6779.000,6779.400," progress"
6779.900,6781.000," the the effect"
6781.500,6783.100," that this practice is having on me so"
6784.100,6786.700," I'm incredibly grateful for that"
6787.500,6789.000," and beautiful"
6790.400,6792.200," so my question is I heard you say"
6793.500,6797.400," you talked about the two assumptions I think and one is that there's an I"
6798.000,6804.800," and when we look inside you can't find you won't find there's no evidence of it of the eye it's the thought"
6805.400,6806.300," and then you talked about"
6807.500,6811.100," that kind of Assumption being to do with externally"
6812.100,6814.200," and you talked about there's no evidence"
6814.900,6819.900," and I was confused what you were saying exactly what you were saying there was it that you were saying"
6820.700,6822.100," there's nothing separate from"
6822.900,6823.900," there's nothing that exists"
6824.400,6826.500," externally separate from awareness"
6827.000,6829.400," there's no evidence is that one thing"
6829.900,6835.100," yeah is that thank you let me out just in the last minute I'll just I'll just go into that a tiny bit"
6835.600,6835.700," so"
6836.200,6838.200," for example you know here's this cup"
6839.500,6839.600," now"
6840.700,6841.800," actually in terms of"
6842.300,6843.400," actual experience"
6844.400,6844.600," there's"
6845.600,6846.900," blue and white"
6847.500,6848.500," in the field of vision"
6849.100,6850.300," with Sheen and Shadow"
6851.200,6852.400," and very aggression"
6853.400,6853.800," there's also"
6855.900,6856.500," the flesh"
6857.500,6858.700," colour of skin"
6859.800,6860.400," and nails"
6861.700,6862.800," and the Shape"
6864.400,6864.900," of that"
6865.500,6869.100," it's basically the the Vision the visual field is basically colours"
6870.300,6871.900," you know it's colours in different shapes"
6872.300,6874.200," that's what's actually being experienced"
6875.400,6875.600," and"
6876.300,6876.800," up"
6877.000,6878.200," is an idea"
6879.200,6879.700," and"
6880.100,6880.900," is an idea"
6881.600,6884.500," as in terms of actual experience"
6885.500,6886.200," is colours"
6887.200,6889.900," now of course there's also Sensation there's touch"
6890.900,6891.800," there's the feeling"
6893.000,6893.400," going on"
6894.300,6900.300," you know I I would you know but if I say well it's in my fingers is in my hand that they're Sensation"
6901.600,6902.000," no"
6902.500,6903.700," there's just the"
6904.900,6908.000," sort of warmth or pressure or kind of Buzz"
6908.500,6909.700," of the energetic"
6910.400,6911.100," quality"
6911.500,6912.500," of sensing"
6913.500,6913.700," something"
6914.400,6917.400," by means of touch in other words there's experience of touch"
6917.800,6918.300," arising"
6918.900,6920.100," there's experience of colour"
6920.400,6920.900," arising"
6922.500,6925.400," in the mind there may be an idea Cup hand"
6926.100,6926.200," you know"
6926.900,6927.800," wait of cut"
6928.600,6932.000," there's all evidence of cup no wait is another experience"
6932.500,6933.100," sensory"
6933.600,6936.400," so actually if you really start unpacking it"
6937.000,6940.600," and you just every time an idea comes up you just let it go"
6941.100,6944.100," so there's only raw sense data"
6945.300,6946.000," then you look at"
6946.900,6950.000," I'm assuming I'm in here as the experiencer"
