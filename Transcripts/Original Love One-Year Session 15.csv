125.700,126.500," to be right here"
126.900,127.300," to be"
128.000,129.600," tuning in to"
132.200,132.400," the"
134.100,135.200," basic fact"
135.700,135.900," of"
136.800,137.100," our"
137.600,140.000," existence which is that in some way"
140.800,141.500," we exist"
142.100,144.400," in some way we exist and we can explore"
145.500,147.200," what that existence"
148.100,148.300," is"
149.500,151.100," what it is to be human"
151.900,153.600," being with human body"
154.500,156.600," human mind human heart"
158.200,159.200," and there are"
160.300,162.000," lots of benefits to"
163.500,166.000," unplugging from the Stream"
167.200,169.700," of our ordinary way of being in the world which"
170.200,171.000," you know many of us"
171.900,173.500," just kind of get caught in a"
174.000,174.200," you know"
174.700,175.900," current of"
176.900,177.800," all kinds of"
180.100,183.700," all kinds of micro currents that are just pulling us and"
184.600,186.500," tugging on us and demanding our attention"
187.300,188.000," and keeping us"
188.500,188.900," away"
189.900,190.900," from recognising"
192.100,192.900," and underlying"
193.700,194.800," fact which is"
195.600,196.200," where existing"
197.700,199.600," where existing and we're aware of it"
200.100,200.900," if we want to be"
202.300,202.500," and"
203.500,206.600," so putting aside time like this Gathering like this"
209.300,209.800," just to be"
211.200,212.500," is is so"
213.200,213.900," import"
214.500,216.200," if we want to actually kind of"
217.900,219.700," Be Alive to the fact that we're alive"
220.900,221.800," and part of that"
223.400,224.000," aliveness"
224.900,226.700," is also about to discovering"
227.600,230.500," our Nan separatists the many ways in which we're"
231.700,234.100," we're profoundly connected and interconnected"
235.800,238.000," with one another and with this planet"
238.900,241.300," and this course is kind of dedicated"
242.300,243.200," mostly to"
244.600,245.300," being"
246.700,250.000," how how and what weighs we're connected with the planet"
250.900,252.500," and last week were sort of looking at"
253.200,256.500," in a way some sort of almost metaphorical ways of coming at that"
258.800,261.900," and you know we were sort-- of using"
263.000,264.900," some sense of our body as being"
265.800,269.600," you know akin and some not just our body but our experience with being sort of"
270.200,271.100," akin to"
272.000,274.300," aspects of this world like mountains"
275.600,276.100," rivers"
277.000,278.200," clouds we touched on"
279.400,280.800," in and the great Earth"
281.800,282.700," as in our title"
283.500,285.100," but this week we're going to"
285.900,287.000," we're going to"
287.800,291.000," we're going to switch Gear a little bit and move towards basically"
292.400,292.800," being"
293.600,296.900," just kind of opening up a little bit to being in the world"
299.200,301.500," you know as our context"
302.200,304.600," and if we're if we're just wind it back to the"
306.000,307.100," to the underlying"
308.100,309.100," sort of bedrock"
311.500,313.300," of Buddhism which paradox"
314.400,315.300," is our suffering"
316.300,317.900," you know the Foundation of Buddhism"
318.800,320.000," is the fact that we suffer"
320.500,321.400," that there is suffering"
322.500,323.100," so it's it's"
323.800,325.800," remarkable as a kind of system"
326.500,328.200," as a method or set of methods"
328.900,329.000," for"
330.000,331.800," helping us in the"
332.400,334.200," it doesn't start by saying you know"
335.000,335.100," you know you know"
336.800,342.400," all is fabulous It Starts by by just the reality of what our problems are in this life that"
343.100,343.400," you know we"
344.300,345.500," we live with"
346.700,347.600," pain & loss and"
348.500,351.800," and hardship of many different kinds of as well as in Justice's and"
352.600,354.600," cruelty and oppression and a great"
355.100,357.100," you know lineages of trauma"
357.700,358.400," and you know"
358.800,360.400," it doesn't shy away from that"
362.300,362.500," but"
363.000,365.900," how do we and you know it's got a formula sort of thing for"
366.300,367.500," for helping us with that"
368.100,369.400," and butt part of that"
369.900,370.600," part of that"
371.000,372.500," it addressing"
373.500,375.400," of our suffering is to recognise"
378.700,382.000," the wider context in which we live has parts of"
382.700,384.400," this world and you know many of us will"
385.000,385.500," have had"
386.400,386.600," whatever"
387.500,388.900," glimpses we've had"
389.700,392.900," of other ways of being that are normal"
393.500,394.500," kind of caught up in"
395.700,398.900," you know on the on the flywheel on the job on the hamster wheel"
399.500,400.000," you know of"
400.700,401.300," our"
401.800,403.300," agendas and to do lists and"
403.900,405.000," goals and our fears"
405.700,406.500," our hopes and our"
407.100,407.500," anxieties"
409.800,414.200," many of us who have had moments of being free of that"
414.700,418.300," and I think that will probably apply to just about all of us at times but"
418.800,420.900," for many they will have happened"
421.800,422.500," when we're"
423.400,425.300," in a non-human context"
425.900,428.500," where in a more than human context when we're"
428.700,430.300," walking in the forest"
431.300,432.000," when we're"
432.400,435.100," on a clear overlooking the ocean when we're"
437.700,440.500," even walking in a park under the great trees"
441.900,442.900," you know or when we're"
443.200,444.100," strolling down"
445.500,448.600," a lane and seeing the Rolling Hills"
450.000,454.000," you know as one of the Psalms says I will lift up my eyes to the Hills"
454.800,456.200," whence cometh my help"
458.200,458.700," that just"
459.600,460.900," seeing the Hill's"
462.000,462.700," can be a help"
464.400,466.200," and there's a lot of beautiful"
467.600,469.700," kind of work and poetry and"
470.500,470.700," and"
471.600,474.200," approaches to this many people have written about this"
474.800,476.200," in very different ways and"
477.000,478.000," and and"
479.600,480.200," I just want to"
480.800,483.500," pluck out one from so many which is just"
484.000,484.900," you know words what"
485.500,486.700," a great English poet"
487.200,488.500," he felt that his"
490.000,492.600," basically his whole psyche was shaped"
493.600,495.400," by The Hills mountains"
495.900,496.800," rivers"
497.400,497.600," and"
498.800,501.300," you know the many Desert denizens thereof"
502.100,503.300," among which he grew up"
504.200,505.600," and really his whole life was"
506.400,507.500," kind of an exploration"
508.500,509.400," of how"
510.300,510.800," his"
511.800,514.000," being had been-- shaped"
515.400,515.700," by the"
516.800,519.900," by the terrain the Landscape the mountains and the rivers"
520.500,521.500," and the great Earth"
521.900,522.500," among which"
523.000,524.100," he grew up and we're going to"
524.600,525.800," touch in a little bit on that"
526.700,528.400," today but let's start with a sipp"
528.800,529.700," let's start by really"
531.800,533.900," easily comfortably gently"
537.900,538.900," being with ourselves"
540.000,541.200," as we are right now"
544.300,545.700," and not demanding that anything"
547.100,547.800," that we do anything"
553.100,555.700," not demanding that we do anything and not demanding"
556.500,560.000," that we have any kind of experience of any particular kind"
560.600,561.500," it's much more"
562.600,564.900," as you know many of you will know from"
565.600,567.000," who have been on original love"
568.000,568.700," sessions before"
569.200,570.800," you know the whole thing"
571.600,576.600," the the method you know we we have these different areas and zones that we look at but the method"
577.400,579.300," essentially in all of them is the same"
580.200,580.400," it's"
581.600,582.200," allowing"
583.600,583.800," it's"
584.300,585.100," releasing"
586.100,588.000," it's recognising resistance"
589.300,590.500," and letting it be"
591.800,593.500," recognising where We're holding"
594.600,595.700," and letting it be"
597.100,600.100," the the method that technique you might even say"
601.200,601.900," is allowing"
602.800,605.700," so we're not trying to make something happen"
607.800,608.400," in any way"
608.900,611.400," that's actually the path of sitting"
612.100,612.300," so"
614.600,615.400," let's get comfortable"
617.500,620.700," get balanced if you're if you're back is is free"
621.800,625.100," not leaning against anything then it's really important to be balanced"
627.200,629.800," so you can just sway forwards and backwards a little bit"
633.100,634.500," and if you're reclining"
635.300,636.600," or your back is supported"
637.700,638.600," that's great just"
639.700,641.300," give yourself to the support"
656.800,660.400," if you're swaying then let the movements be small and gentle"
661.800,662.400," slow"
664.600,667.700," see how small they can get just tiny arcs"
669.300,670.500," backwards and forwards"
674.100,676.600," start to feel the the Plumb line"
678.000,679.800," that the true line"
681.800,683.100," from the crown of your head"
684.300,685.900," down under the center of the seat"
687.800,688.900," and on down through"
690.100,691.200," the seat you're sitting on"
691.600,693.900," down down down down down down into the Earth"
696.900,698.300," so there's a line from"
700.000,701.200," way up in the sky"
702.900,706.400," right down through the crown of your head through the center of your seat"
707.600,709.200," and on down into the Earth"
712.100,714.400," and whenever you need to do just gently"
715.300,716.400," subtly shifting"
718.500,719.900," to feel that line and"
720.900,722.100," be aligned with it"
723.200,725.600," and it come right down through the middle of you"
737.200,737.400," and"
739.200,740.100," because we're"
740.500,741.200," aligned"
742.000,742.600," around it"
744.900,747.700," or again if you are reclining or supported because"
748.600,750.000," we have that support"
751.200,752.900," we're able to start relaxing"
756.000,758.500," so Letting Letting the face goes soft"
764.400,765.200," and letting"
766.400,767.100," the JW"
768.200,768.700," goes off"
777.700,779.100," let the jaw sink"
781.200,782.000," a little bit"
790.000,791.300," shoulders and arms"
792.000,793.200," also sinking"
797.300,797.900," settling"
800.000,802.200," make sure your hands are somewhere comfortable"
803.800,806.900," so that the length of the arms can really be Slack"
812.500,816.700," let all thumbs and fingers also be slack limp"
822.900,823.500," that yeah"
824.600,825.600," your feet go"
826.000,827.100," let your toes go"
830.500,831.700," now your legs go"
836.200,836.700," see it"
838.200,839.100," barely chest"
841.800,842.100," soft"
844.100,844.800," at ease"
859.000,861.100," just sort of coming into a awareness"
863.200,864.700," of this body"
868.700,870.000," this solid body"
877.100,879.100," kind of dents flesh"
880.300,881.000," then"
881.300,881.900," sir b"
885.900,886.700," in some ways"
887.700,888.900," solid like the Earth"
889.700,890.800," of which is made"
911.700,914.600," so letting this piece of the Earth this"
915.900,916.200," body"
917.900,918.500," rest"
920.700,921.900," like the Earth itself"
930.100,930.900," almost as if"
931.900,934.900," just now it's it were part of the Earth"
940.500,942.000," like a single body"
945.300,947.600," this body and the body of the Earth"
964.400,967.700," if you can just tuned into the quality of"
969.100,969.400," stillness"
971.000,971.300," and"
972.800,973.400," a kind of"
974.100,975.000," solidity"
977.700,978.000," and"
979.400,982.000," contiguous with the Arts"
988.700,993.500," and yeah by by the way from time to time thoughts may come up and"
994.600,995.500," we go off somewhere"
996.600,999.600," in our minds and then we recognise we have and"
1000.600,1000.900," we can"
1001.800,1003.100," smile at the thoughts and"
1004.300,1005.800," just label them thinking"
1006.800,1007.900," or thoughts"
1009.300,1010.100," and come back"
1011.200,1012.100," to this body"
1013.600,1015.400," resting on this earth here"
1030.200,1033.400," and throughout our practice our meditation path"
1034.800,1038.300," often thoughts will come up and take us away like that"
1039.100,1040.800," it's just part of the journey and"
1041.800,1042.800," when we notice it"
1043.900,1047.100," fantastic means we've come back we're present again"
1048.900,1050.300," just use a little label"
1052.500,1053.700," thoughts or thinking"
1057.600,1059.000," or if you prefer you might"
1060.000,1062.500," check out what's being going on was it planning"
1063.700,1064.100," was it"
1065.000,1066.800," plans memories or was it"
1067.300,1067.900," imagining"
1069.500,1071.000," memories remembering"
1072.100,1072.600," planning"
1073.500,1074.000," plans"
1075.100,1075.800," imagining"
1077.300,1079.000," you can just check which it was"
1079.600,1079.600," in"
1080.300,1080.800," come back"
1082.000,1082.200," here"
1085.800,1086.000," body"
1123.700,1126.500," bursts of the traditional four elements"
1139.400,1140.100," so it"
1141.100,1141.500," still"
1152.800,1153.400," this body"
1161.000,1162.500," oh yeah we're also"
1163.300,1164.400," full of flow"
1165.300,1166.400," for a liquidity"
1168.500,1168.900," the"
1169.700,1171.500," 50,000 miles of the"
1173.200,1176.400," cardiovascular system the art is veins capillaries"
1179.200,1180.200," flowing flowing"
1190.800,1194.000," constant inflowing out flow between cells"
1195.500,1196.200," cells"
1196.800,1198.400," through their cell walls and"
1199.500,1201.000," the bloodstream with the"
1201.800,1202.900," emphatic system"
1205.900,1208.000," flow all through the body as well"
1210.200,1210.800," so"
1219.100,1222.700," maybe we can just get a subtle light sense of the"
1224.600,1226.000," Subtle pulses and"
1227.200,1229.400," so to quickenings and stirrings"
1231.000,1232.600," and these fluid systems"
1251.500,1253.900," our life being sustained not just by"
1254.700,1256.400," earth but also water"
1259.100,1260.900," and flow and fluidity"
1314.100,1318.200," I'm seeing if in the midst of our stillness we might sense"
1319.900,1320.300," different"
1320.900,1323.500," flavours of flowing this"
1329.400,1330.400," also tree"
1331.500,1332.800," subtle signatures"
1336.200,1338.000," maybe like tingles"
1347.800,1350.000," maybe a kind of smoothness that"
1351.100,1352.200," comes with flow"
1381.900,1382.300," and"
1383.300,1384.300," there's warmth"
1386.700,1388.100," our bodies are warm"
1393.100,1394.600," he comes to us"
1396.100,1397.100," from the sun"
1398.900,1399.800," primarily"
1401.700,1404.100," some geothermal warms as well"
1406.100,1407.300," kind of feeling"
1410.300,1412.300," all these planetary systems"
1413.300,1415.200," including This body"
1417.700,1419.500," the warmth is sort of given"
1420.500,1421.000," to us"
1422.800,1424.400," like the earth like the"
1425.300,1426.200," fluidity"
1427.000,1427.400," also"
1429.200,1430.600," the gift of Wands"
1441.700,1442.500," and we made"
1442.600,1443.700," being a cold place"
1445.400,1447.200," needing the warmth of a dwelling and"
1448.700,1450.500," it may be in a hot place and"
1452.100,1452.500," when I ever"
1454.100,1455.300," we live in"
1457.600,1458.700," the shelter of"
1460.400,1461.100," a warmth"
1465.800,1467.400," clothing dwelling"
1469.700,1470.600," atmosphere"
1471.800,1472.300," sand"
1492.200,1493.200," the sun Sol"
1495.000,1499.300," blazingly hot but even at this distance as we circle"
1500.700,1501.600," it it's warming us"
1511.800,1515.300," Now remarkable that we could be directly sensing it"
1516.400,1518.200," as such a vast distance"
1526.700,1526.900," how"
1527.900,1528.600," intimately"
1529.100,1531.100," connected our life is to"
1532.900,1534.700," at that flaming ball"
1536.100,1537.800," 93 million miles away"
1543.900,1546.200," but intimately part of our experience"
1549.900,1550.800," warmth"
1557.500,1558.500," we're not alone"
1565.800,1566.300," we're not"
1567.500,1568.600," isolated"
1570.000,1571.100," independent"
1573.900,1575.700," where parts of a system"
1594.500,1596.000," we do actually belong"
1619.900,1622.400," and most interval intimate of all"
1624.900,1625.700," here it is"
1628.000,1628.600," the breath"
1632.200,1635.200," as I breathe in the universe is breathing out"
1640.100,1643.400," as I breathe out the universe is breathing in"
1652.600,1655.200," and intimate back and forth"
1658.200,1659.200," all right here"
1687.000,1689.700," that in the body being a deep state of rest"
1690.600,1692.800," checking the jaw and shoulders are relaxed"
1700.400,1703.600," and in that state of"
1705.200,1706.100," he's"
1711.500,1712.200," let the"
1713.300,1714.800," world breathing to you"
1717.900,1718.800," and let"
1720.500,1722.100," it take your out bre"
1722.300,1723.400," as it breathes"
1734.900,1737.700," in is there a way we can let breath be"
1738.800,1740.000," not done by us"
1743.000,1743.100," but"
1743.900,1744.500," the home"
1744.800,1745.100," bye"
1748.600,1750.300," our intimate partnership"
1751.800,1754.400," with this with this atmosphere of the world"
1762.100,1763.800," learning breath"
1766.600,1767.300," ease"
1769.400,1769.800," us"
1773.500,1774.700," soothes us"
1860.700,1863.400," as they stillness of our body"
1869.800,1870.700," there's the"
1871.500,1873.800," light subtle pulse tree"
1874.900,1877.300," sense of the flowing within our body"
1882.700,1883.900," and there's the warmth"
1887.200,1888.800," of the sense of"
1890.600,1892.100," the presence of our body"
1894.200,1895.600," but light warmth"
1897.200,1898.400," sometimes it's like a little"
1898.900,1899.500," glow"
1906.300,1908.100," and then all of that is"
1910.600,1911.200," very"
1912.400,1913.900," gentle context"
1918.000,1921.400," in which they subtle movement back and forth"
1924.900,1925.600," the lapping"
1927.200,1928.300," of the breath"
1928.600,1928.800," like"
1930.900,1931.800," little waves"
1934.400,1935.500," on a calm day"
1937.500,1938.600," by the shore"
1947.600,1949.700," moving up the sand a little way"
1951.100,1952.300," and withdrawing"
1960.600,1961.000," like"
1962.000,1966.400," a like a little subtle movement at the edge of a great stillness"
2018.100,2018.900," we've"
2020.200,2022.900," being through the four elements"
2024.200,2026.200," noticing their presence here"
2027.900,2030.000," some traditions say there's a fifth"
2030.600,2031.000," Element"
2032.500,2033.500," which is space"
2037.100,2038.100," without space"
2040.600,2041.200," none of this"
2048.300,2051.500," so there's a an invitation if you're curious to"
2052.900,2054.900," see if there's any way in which"
2055.900,2057.400," there's a sense of space"
2060.000,2061.300," either within your body"
2065.200,2068.900," sometimes the body can seem like a kind of warm Halo"
2076.800,2078.100," or outside- the body"
2082.600,2083.200," the space"
2084.100,2084.700," around us"
2090.400,2091.400," possibly both"
2093.600,2094.700," within the body"
2096.700,2098.200," and outside the body"
2101.000,2101.600," space"
2117.900,2122.300," it's also possible to basically stay with this gentle"
2124.000,2124.500," lapping"
2125.300,2126.100," of the breath"
2127.300,2128.600," like a slow motion"
2131.300,2132.100," flowing up"
2133.300,2134.200," flowing down"
2136.300,2137.600," a little Flo"
2137.700,2138.100," in"
2139.600,2140.700," a little Flo"
2141.200,2141.700," out"
2143.300,2146.300," so also possible to stay with that"
2148.500,2150.200," and have a sense that it's"
2151.800,2153.500," happening within"
2156.200,2157.300," the space of the body"
2162.800,2165.200," and even that is happening within"
2167.200,2168.700,"a general space"
2170.900,2172.000," all around us"
2173.000,2174.300," and all through us"
2185.700,2189.000," when if you prefer to let go of the body of the breath"
2190.600,2193.600," or already have this just 100% fine"
2195.300,2196.200," rest in"
2197.900,2198.900," the sense of the body"
2201.600,2204.300," in the sense of space or through the body"
2206.000,2206.900," and all around"
2284.300,2285.600," and in the last"
2286.600,2287.900," minutes of"
2288.500,2289.700," our meditation this morning"
2290.900,2294.800," you're welcome to also if you like the idea of"
2295.500,2297.100," it to explore"
2298.400,2298.800," weather"
2301.700,2303.800," there's a sense of a larger consciousness"
2305.600,2307.200," spreading all through experience"
2308.400,2309.200," and holding"
2310.400,2311.400," all experience"
2312.600,2313.200," not just"
2314.400,2316.500," a space and a spaciousness"
2318.300,2319.800," a kind of intelligence"
2321.000,2322.000," and awareness"
2325.300,2327.100," all through and all around"
2329.300,2330.000," our exper"
2334.600,2337.000," almost like a backdrop to it"
2339.100,2340.300," that's always been here"
2341.800,2342.700," regardless"
2343.800,2345.200," of what we may be experiencing"
2346.700,2347.400," at any time"
2362.900,2367.600," perhaps even spaciousness is actually held also by this"
2368.900,2370.600," kind of backdrive"
2371.500,2372.600," intelligence"
2375.600,2376.500," awareness"
2381.100,2382.100," alive nurse"
2480.600,2481.100," so"
2482.300,2482.800," no"
2484.200,2486.300," we're we're coming nominally to the"
2487.600,2489.700," clothes of a sitting period but"
2490.800,2496.200," whatever you do whether you decide to sit a little longer or whether you decide to take a break now"
2496.700,2498.200," before you move"
2499.400,2500.700," just check in"
2502.200,2502.900," be aware"
2504.800,2506.100," and see if you can"
2507.200,2508.400," move within"
2509.500,2511.200," same feel a little awareness"
2512.600,2513.400," that you've been"
2514.800,2516.900," maybe having glimpses of while"
2517.200,2517.800," sitting"
2519.100,2520.100," really the"
2520.700,2524.900," sort of state of being doesn't need to change action actually just because we're"
2525.600,2526.000," moving"
2528.900,2528.900," so"
2530.800,2534.400," whatever works for you right now whether to sit more or"
2536.000,2538.600," gently move the body and come into"
2541.400,2542.900," come into movement and perhaps"
2544.200,2548.800," taking care of yourself in the little break we're going to have and we'll reconvene"
2549.700,2551.700," at 50 minutes past"
2552.300,2553.700," the hour in seven minutes"

3006.900,3009.000," awareness of experiences in"
3009.500,3009.700," and"

3028.900,3031.700," acknowledged you know as I was mentioning last time"
3032.700,3033.900," deep in the Zen tradition"

3038.500,3046.200," nature is the great teacher and that it is valued over and above quote unquote civilisation"
3047.000,3048.500," and that's what they used to think and"

3846.400,3847.800," you know when we're"
3849.700,3849.900," just"
3850.500,3851.900," lost in our business"
3853.100,3854.200," and recognise it"
3854.700,3856.500," and don't know quite what to do about it"
3857.100,3858.200," and have the good sense"
3858.900,3860.500," to just go to the park"
3862.000,3864.000," and walk under the on the grass"
3865.100,3867.200," or walk on the on the Sandy gravel"
3868.100,3869.100," among the trees"
3870.400,3871.100," and stop"
3871.900,3872.800," and look at a bush"
3873.900,3874.400," maybe"
3875.000,3875.700," don't just look"
3876.100,3877.800," gently run your hands over it"
3878.200,3878.700," feel"
3879.600,3881.200," it if you can kick off your shoes"
3881.800,3882.900," and walk on the grass"
3883.700,3883.800," get"
3884.200,3886.300," you know more connected"
3887.200,3887.800," if we have"
3888.400,3892.200," as we sometimes do and information that that might be a good thing to do and we do do it"
3894.200,3895.400," or if we can"
3896.800,3898.000," it's the end of a busy day"
3898.900,3900.500," and we're weary and overwhelmed"
3901.400,3902.400," but instead of slumping"
3904.100,3904.400," in"
3905.100,3908.700," an armchair which is also by the way nice thing to do not knocking that"
3909.000,3910.600," but instead we get in the car and drive"
3911.000,3911.500," five minutes"
3912.200,3912.900," and get to"
3914.700,3915.600," a seashore"
3917.200,3917.900," or get to"
3918.800,3919.600," a river bank"
3921.500,3922.200," and park"
3923.200,3924.300," and walk along it"
3927.000,3927.800," very quickly"
3928.800,3929.200," are"
3929.900,3931.600," perspective shifts"
3932.600,3933.700," very quickly"
3934.500,3935.600," we just"
3936.500,3941.400," it's not that you know it's solves our troubles it's more that"
3942.100,3942.600," we just"
3944.000,3945.500," cannot but almost"
3946.400,3946.800," help"
3947.400,3949.300," recognizing a wider"
3949.700,3950.500," context"
3951.000,3951.900," it's not like we"
3952.400,3953.500," we have to sort of"
3955.200,3955.700," I don't know"
3956.100,3957.400," figure out a way to"
3958.500,3959.400," think and feel differently"
3960.000,3961.500," we don't have to do that at all we just"
3962.300,3962.600," we just"
3963.100,3964.000," get to"
3966.000,3967.400," you know whether it's a seashore"
3967.800,3968.400," a cliff"
3969.000,3969.700," a riverbank"
3970.700,3972.300," bank of a canal will work"
3973.300,3974.300," and there's just this"
3976.500,3978.000," physical sense that"
3979.000,3980.500," we don't have to think about we just"
3980.800,3981.200," find"
3982.000,3982.700," that some kind of"
3983.600,3985.800," gravity or something at work that"
3987.000,3988.200," connects us with the water"
3988.800,3990.200," connects us with the sky"
3990.900,3991.800," connects us with the"
3992.100,3995.900," the great bowls of the trees that live in a totally different timescale"
3997.500,3999.600," I mean you know you know the the trees life is"
4000.500,4005.000," but whether it's 200 to 400 years on average or whatever it is or you know depend on species"
4005.600,4007.400," Thousand Years in some cases you know"
4008.800,4010.300," and then what about the waters"
4011.500,4012.400," sort of a lifetime"
4013.300,4015.400," you know how can we even think about that you know"
4018.200,4023.600," and the motion of the water this great water system all these different forms that comes in the"
4024.200,4025.500," the sludgy canal"
4026.000,4027.200," the sparkling stream"
4028.000,4028.700," the cloud"
4029.400,4029.600," the"
4030.800,4031.400," rainfall"
4032.100,4036.200," the pounding rain shower and the light missed like drizzle that can"
4036.900,4039.600," hang around for weeks on end in some parts of the world and"
4040.400,4044.500," and obviously there's the Lakes I am the mountains and low in the Lowlands and there's"
4045.500,4046.200," the ocean"
4046.900,4047.900," and the seas and"
4048.500,4049.700," you know all of this is"
4050.700,4051.800," it's sort of part of our"
4052.500,4055.500," as part of our life because we're part of its life"
4056.900,4057.700," and any"
4058.700,4062.200," any capacity we have to expose ourselves to it"
4063.500,4063.600," you know"
4064.200,4064.500," it'll"
4065.100,4066.000," it'll not only"
4067.600,4070.300," help us just interrupt the"
4071.200,4073.600," the sort of ceaseless flow of"
4074.400,4074.700," our you know"
4075.400,4076.600," the the inner"
4078.300,4082.500," thinking and feeling tangles that we can so easily get caught in"
4083.200,4085.300," but it's more than that it actually"
4087.000,4088.900," seems to have a capacity to"
4089.800,4091.600," help us with our hardest things"
4092.700,4093.700," can help us with our"
4094.200,4096.700," you know really Grievous situations that are"
4097.100,4099.200," that seem insoluble sometimes and"
4099.800,4101.500," losses that we're facing and just"
4102.200,4103.800," immensely challenging sit"
4104.500,4107.100," we're facing sometimes just"
4107.500,4108.000," to be"
4108.900,4110.400," under a great big tree"
4111.200,4114.600," all by a great big river or even a little stream"
4116.500,4117.200," is actually"
4120.500,4124.100," it it's enough because it somehow reminds us that"
4124.900,4125.600," we're also"
4126.800,4127.100," a body"
4127.800,4128.100," which"
4128.600,4130.400," is inseparable from"
4131.700,4132.800," planetary matter"
4133.900,4135.400," the matter of the planet"
4135.700,4136.800," inseparable from"
4137.800,4138.300," it and actually"
4139.500,4139.900," are"
4140.600,4141.300," troubles and"
4142.300,4143.400," in especially the sort of"
4144.100,4144.300," the"
4145.100,4146.600," the you know they're really"
4147.000,4148.000," deep troubles we have"
4149.600,4151.000," in some ways our"
4156.000,4156.500," actually"
4157.500,4158.100," we can see"
4159.300,4160.500," that their part is some"
4161.900,4164.100," they're not just analogous to their part of"
4165.400,4166.600," Greater processes"
4167.500,4169.300," that goes through the same Cycles"
4170.200,4170.800," of growing"
4172.300,4173.300," of disruption"
4174.300,4174.600," of"
4175.000,4175.600," ending"
4176.900,4177.600," of loss"
4178.600,4179.600," it's actually"
4180.700,4181.300," a deep"
4181.900,4182.400," natural"
4183.000,4183.500," cycle"
4184.700,4184.900," that"
4185.700,4186.600," shows itself"
4187.200,4188.600," throughout the Natural World"
4189.900,4190.500," as things"
4191.700,4192.600," come into existence"
4193.900,4198.200," but he think of how how remarkable this little seed of whatever plant"
4198.900,4200.200," you know reduces"
4201.800,4204.000," immensely complex organism"
4204.600,4205.700," botanical organism"
4206.500,4209.700," you know there can be enormous out of a tiny seed"
4210.200,4212.500," and all the sort of you know all the"
4213.500,4215.800," impulses there in that tiny"
4216.200,4216.900," seed and"
4218.400,4220.800," up comes the in the mighty Oak you know"
4221.700,4223.800," and lives A Thousand Years"
4224.400,4225.400," but it's gonna end"
4226.400,4227.100," it's gonna end"
4227.700,4229.000," and not only"
4229.800,4231.200," and the same thing with mountains"
4231.600,4234.300," was you know we don't really see that because it's so"
4234.800,4237.000," such a huge time scale but mountains"
4238.100,4239.700," thrust upward at some point"
4240.500,4241.800," you know tectonic plates"
4242.300,4244.200," crunch of upcoming the mountains and"
4245.100,4246.700," and they're being worn down"
4248.300,4249.100," you know they will"
4249.900,4250.400," they will"
4251.100,4251.900," The Valleys"
4252.800,4253.900," how does it go though the"
4254.800,4257.200," the valleys will be raised and the"
4258.400,4260.200," mountains laid low"
4260.500,4264.200," somewhere in is it in Isaiah or something I can't remember quite the wording but"
4264.900,4268.200," it is that it's it's we know it's true you know"
4270.200,4270.600," everything"
4271.800,4273.600," is in flow which means"
4274.500,4275.400," it's coming into being"
4276.500,4277.900," it's enduring for a while"
4279.000,4279.900," always changing"
4280.900,4281.300," and then"
4282.900,4283.800," going away again"
4285.300,4285.600," and"
4287.300,4288.900," when we are"
4289.800,4292.500," again this is not really sort of cognitive it's just"
4293.300,4294.000," when we're just"
4295.600,4296.300," closer"
4296.600,4296.600," to"
4297.700,4299.800," the great world in which the human world"
4300.300,4302.200," and all its trappings arises"
4303.500,4307.500," and of which the human world is one manifestation"
4308.100,4311.500," one multifarious multiplicitous manifestation"
4312.300,4312.700," we just"
4313.600,4315.800," I don't think we need to think about it we just"
4318.600,4324.200," want to say recognise it but even that sounds too conscious we don't necessarily doesn't need to be a conscious thing"
4324.800,4326.100," we just are"
4328.400,4331.300," we're coming home a little bit somehow"
4332.000,4332.900," and sense it"
4333.300,4334.900," and sense that our troubles"
4335.800,4339.400," and our tribulations and our Grievous losses even as well"
4340.400,4340.900," ah"
4341.200,4343.300," part of a greater process"
4344.600,4344.700," you know"
4346.100,4346.400," um"
4348.100,4349.300," so that's why"
4350.400,4351.700," it can be so helpful"
4352.400,4352.800," to get"
4353.700,4354.600," you know into"
4357.100,4358.300," natural context"
4358.600,4360.600," as much as we can when we can"
4362.100,4363.000," but you know"
4363.800,4364.200," that that's"
4364.700,4366.500," not really the end of it I think there's"
4367.300,4368.400," there's there's there's a kind of"
4369.600,4371.400," there's a kind of lesson really"
4373.800,4374.800," not just in that"
4375.300,4376.500," arising and passing"
4377.400,4379.000," that is happening all through"
4379.600,4380.300," this world"
4380.900,4381.500," but also"
4382.500,4385.800," there is a there's sort of a difference isn't there somehow"
4386.500,4390.600," I don't I don't want to sort of over generalized but somehow seems like"
4391.200,4392.400," in the Natural World"
4393.800,4397.000," is there actually like words of the same there's a calm"
4397.700,4398.900," and a sort of steadiness"
4400.700,4405.700," that he learned from it even in the fretful Dwellings of Mankind of humanity"
4406.400,4408.800," but is it would it be true to say that the"
4409.800,4410.900," their really isn't"
4412.200,4414.100," the same kind of clinging"
4415.500,4416.600," and resisting"
4417.700,4419.200," I don't know this is I'm a bit"
4419.700,4421.000," of suggesting this but"
4421.500,4422.500," I wonder whether"
4423.200,4424.900," one of the ways it helps us is because"
4425.700,4428.800," in the Natural World basically there is no clinging"
4429.500,4430.300," and grasping"
4430.800,4434.800," and there is no resisting now it's not it will be wrong to say that"
4435.200,4436.100," organisms don't"
4437.100,4437.500," try to"
4437.800,4438.300," survive"
4439.100,4441.000," they do even bacteria"
4441.700,4443.000," you know I tried to avoid"
4443.500,4443.900," toxic"
4444.500,4446.700," environments and seek nutrients"
4448.600,4448.700," but"
4449.200,4450.400," is there actually"
4452.600,4455.300," clinging and grasping and resisting"
4456.300,4457.900," as sort of this shouldn't be happening"
4459.800,4460.300," idea"
4460.700,4462.700," I don't know it's just a it's just a question that I"
4463.200,4463.600," don't have a"
4464.600,4465.200," defensible"
4465.800,4468.100," clear article but I still suspect that"
4468.800,4471.200," one of the ways we learn or we"
4471.800,4473.300," get this sort of subtle learning"
4474.200,4474.500," in this"
4475.100,4476.100," more natural contest"
4476.700,4477.200," is that there's"
4478.900,4482.800," you know just look at a tree it really doesn't seem to me to be doing much"
4484.000,4484.600," resisting"
4486.100,4486.600," or clinging"
4488.400,4489.600," it's just sort of open"
4490.500,4490.800," here"
4493.200,4494.900," and when the time comes"
4496.300,4498.300," there's a Gail and a branch breaks and"
4499.000,4500.500," microbes get in and"
4501.200,4503.200," the whole thing gets less healthy and"
4504.200,4507.500," there's rock creepin in and gradually it's it's time"
4508.300,4509.300," It's Time Has Come"
4510.200,4510.300," you know"
4511.400,4511.800," does it"
4512.400,4513.000," resist"
4513.500,4514.600," no no no no no you know"
4515.400,4516.200," you know you know"
4517.200,4518.200," presumably not"
4518.900,4519.000," you know"
4520.200,4522.600," presumably it's just let's it happen"
4524.100,4525.500," you know and so that is"
4526.600,4529.700," that is a key ingredient for our"
4531.400,4532.400," our well-being"
4533.000,4536.900," that we were just touching on it a little bit last week with this term for"
4537.500,4539.700," zen monastics the unsweet"
4540.200,4541.300," clouds and Rivers"
4542.300,4544.200," drift like the clouds flow like the rivers"
4544.600,4545.600," no resistance"
4546.700,4549.000," but actually as then Cohen which says I'm"
4550.300,4552.300," the when the wind blows"
4553.100,4554.600," the Downy sea Bulls"
4555.100,4555.700," float away"
4556.800,4559.600," and the wind blows a little puffs from"
4560.300,4561.800," of cotton that can"
4562.800,4563.900," hold seeds you know"
4564.600,4565.500," they just float"
4566.100,4568.300," they go with the Wind there's no resistance"
4569.400,4570.300," they can't resist"
4572.000,4576.200,"what what would that mean for us"
4577.100,4578.400," if we didn't resist"
4581.200,4583.200," natural process of being"
4583.800,4584.400," being this"
4585.900,4586.700," what happens"
4587.700,4592.500," to us if we don't resist where in what ways do we resist and what happens if we"
4595.900,4599.900," let that resistance be and go to the sort of larger space where"
4600.800,4602.000," we're not resisting anything"
4603.200,4604.700," we're even allowing a little"
4605.300,4607.100," kernel of resistance to be a rising"
4607.700,4608.900," because we're not resisting anything"
4610.400,4611.200," like the Oak"
4612.300,4613.100," what happens then"
4615.200,4616.000," you know what does that"
4616.500,4617.700," do for our well-being"
4619.100,4621.000," um so okay so those are a few"
4622.400,4623.000," thoughts on"
4624.300,4627.100," on another way of sort of looking at our place"
4628.100,4628.900," in this planet"
4629.900,4634.500," Mount is rivers and a great Earth and I thought I'd just do if I man just gonna do one more little"
4635.600,4641.000," snippet from I say from my new book original love where"
4641.600,4642.000," um"
4644.300,4647.200," you know there's little Interlude throughout the book where"
4647.800,4650.600," I'm writing about the place I was staying in"
4651.500,4656.000," actually with two places when I when I when I wrote the book or the first draft of it which was one was"
4658.900,4663.000," most of it was actually in one of some parts of it were written in this"
4663.600,4664.000," cave"
4664.600,4668.200," um high up and 9,400 feet in the sangre de Cristo mountains"
4668.900,4670.400," where I was lucky enough to be granted"
4671.800,4672.000," few"
4672.600,4674.500," three times as a sort of refuge place"
4675.900,4676.100," and"
4677.300,4678.100," but mostly"
4678.800,4682.100," the first draft was in written in these cabins"
4682.700,4685.700," one of the one of the cabins up in a lodge"
4686.400,4687.700," underneath the browser's Cliffs"
4688.400,4688.500," and"
4689.400,4691.700," the cliffs Rose way above going up"
4694.400,4699.100," to two thousand feet above the river so the cabins were sort of maybe 500 feet above the river"
4700.100,4701.100," the side of a meadow"
4701.900,4703.400," then the cliff goes soaring up"
4704.100,4705.700," 1.7 billion years old"
4707.300,4709.300," and then but from the cabin I could"
4710.000,4710.700," walk down"
4711.600,4712.400," a trail"
4713.000,4713.700," to the river"
4714.800,4719.500," and it was a you know glorious mountain river this was that"
4719.800,4721.900," cabins were at 8,500 feet"
4723.400,4723.600," and"
4725.700,4727.100," the river you know would be"
4728.500,4730.400," bracingly cold and I actually"
4730.900,4733.100," an all seasons I love to go down"
4733.800,4734.300," and get a"
4734.600,4734.900," brief"
4735.400,4737.200," immersion in a very very"
4739.400,4740.000," invigorating"
4740.600,4744.100," and quite delicious also sometimes a bit shocking but"
4744.600,4745.200," anyway one"
4746.000,4750.100," so here and there in the book those of you imagine many of you weren't of read it"
4750.400,4752.600," yet there are sort of interludes"
4752.900,4754.000," about being up there"
4754.800,4755.700," and so I wanted to just"
4757.000,4759.600," share one here that touches on this theme"
4760.500,4763.800," so I'm going down in the late evening"
4764.800,4769.000," in late dusk I says very late dusk with a three-quarter moon up"
4769.700,4772.700," so I just enough light to see what I was doing but still the Paths"
4773.100,4773.700," are different"
4774.200,4774.800," at night"
4775.300,4777.100," I know the way even in the dark"
4777.500,4779.400," and Scramble over some fallen logs"
4780.000,4781.600," ceiling case in snowdrifts"
4782.600,4784.000," and soon I arrived"
4784.600,4785.300," at the river"
4785.700,4788.600," so much snow has been melting up in the mountains"
4789.200,4794.700," that the River is three or four hands deeper than usual right here a few weeks ago"
4795.500,4797.300," before the big melt started"
4797.700,4798.400," it was barely"
4798.800,4799.900," bathtub deep"
4800.700,4801.000," today"
4801.800,4803.300," it's much easier to get in"
4803.700,4806.800," and get a good soaking having carefully taken off my clothes"
4807.300,4809.800," endeavouring not to stand on any sharp twigs or rocks"
4810.500,4812.100," I find it's waist deep"
4812.900,4815.600," so I I can lie down just about anywhere"
4816.000,4816.300," and get"
4816.900,4819.100," immersed I float still for a moment feeling"
4819.800,4823.800," the prodigious chill of the current that same snow melt"
4824.300,4828.600," is making it biting cold and the flow accentuates the bite"
4829.900,4835.100," I sit up still submerged and see a star in the sky over the Ravine it's double"
4835.500,4837.100," shimmers on the quivering"
4837.500,4839.000," current between my knees"
4839.800,4840.500," as I'm getting up"
4841.000,4843.400," I see the moon behind me and the water"
4844.000,4846.300," sparkling beneath it a little up river"
4847.200,4847.900," from where I am"
4848.300,4849.500," I gaze at the star"
4850.000,4850.800," and then at the moon"
4851.600,4853.800," then as soon as I am out I get that wonderful"
4854.400,4856.800," warm feeling that comes after very cold water"
4857.400,4861.300," and start to feel quite dry already in no time it seems"
4861.800,4862.300," my skin"
4863.000,4864.600," is being evaporated"
4865.300,4866.100," by the dry"
4866.400,4867.500," high altitude air"
4868.700,4870.300," and it's a slow business getting dressed"
4870.800,4871.500," after a quick"
4872.100,4873.700," and almost unnecessary rub"
4874.100,4875.000," with a small towel"
4875.300,4876.300," on my way out"
4877.100,4879.300," I step into a bar of Moonlight"
4880.000,4881.600," it looks yellow under the trees"
4882.600,4887.200," then back up the cliff path Stepping Up on rocks and over roots"
4888.000,4889.700," that seemed as though they were made"
4890.100,4891.100," for human beings"
4891.500,4893.100," to use as steps"
4894.100,4894.800," just as good"
4895.300,4897.600," as any human-made staircase"
4899.200,4901.600," which point it occurs to me that there"
4902.100,4902.500," fit"
4902.900,4903.800," that they're fit"
4904.300,4905.000," isn't so"
4905.600,4906.200," surprising"
4907.000,4908.800," we were indeed"
4909.400,4909.700," made"
4910.400,4910.800," for them"
4912.000,4914.100," these right here are the conditions"
4914.700,4916.400," for which our limbs"
4916.900,4917.500," evolved"
4918.100,4919.600," we are actually made"
4920.000,4921.600," to walk and Climb"
4921.800,4923.500," over these very rocks"
4924.000,4924.500," and Logs"
4925.200,4926.200," and sometimes"
4926.600,4927.400," to wash off"
4927.800,4929.300," in these brisk cold"
4929.700,4930.300," rivers"
4930.900,4932.000," this is not new"
4932.500,4933.400," this is old"
4934.200,4935.300," and feeling this way"
4935.900,4937.300," is an old human"
4938.000,4938.600," stirring"
4939.800,4940.600," is it the same"
4941.300,4942.100," in meditation"
4943.100,4943.900," AA recovery"
4944.700,4946.000," of an old humanity"
4946.600,4947.100," hidden"
4947.500,4947.800," deep"
4948.200,4949.000," inside"
4950.000,4952.800," perhaps not from all our ancestors"
4953.600,4954.200," but some"
4955.100,4956.500," a few who learned"
4957.000,4958.000," to meet the world"
4959.100,4960.000," by being still"
4961.000,4962.200," and letting it seep"
4962.500,4963.000," into them"
4963.700,4963.900," and"
4964.700,4965.400," dissolve them"
4966.300,4968.600," so that they read discovered their kinship"
4969.100,4969.900," with all things"
4970.500,4971.700," and woke back up"
4972.400,4973.300," into an old"
4974.000,4974.800," dream life"
4975.700,4977.000," in which they were separate"
4977.500,4978.000," from nothing"
4978.700,4979.100," and could be"
4980.000,4980.800," all things"
4992.900,4994.600," now let me just consult my little"
4995.500,4997.700," seat here anything else that I need to"
4999.700,5000.200," bring up"
5000.500,5003.200," before we go to discussion and question"
5003.900,5004.300," Time"
5008.100,5009.500," I'll just mention"
5010.100,5010.500," actually that"
5012.100,5012.700," we had"
5013.400,5013.600," sort of"
5014.200,5014.900," emphasis on"
5015.400,5017.100," let's say zone one last time"
5018.100,5020.900," kinda emphasis on Zone to this time"
5021.700,5022.400," next time"
5024.900,5026.600," I want to be"
5027.300,5029.100," focusing a little more on"
5030.400,5032.500," this phrase"
5032.900,5034.600," that was the origin of the quote"
5035.200,5038.200," that was the quote that was the origin for the title of this course"
5039.500,5040.900," mountain is rivers and the great Earth"
5041.300,5044.700," I came to see that the mind of wisdom"
5045.300,5047.300," was nothing other than the sun"
5047.900,5048.400," the moon"
5049.100,5050.000," and the stars"
5050.900,5051.900," the mountains"
5052.400,5053.000," rivers"
5053.900,5054.900," and the great Earth"
5056.300,5057.300," or more simply"
5057.900,5058.600," I came"
5059.000,5059.400," to see"
5060.100,5061.700," that my mind"
5062.300,5063.000," was"
5063.900,5065.000," the son moon"
5065.500,5066.500," and stars"
5067.000,5067.900," the mountains"
5068.200,5068.800," rivers"
5069.400,5070.200," and the great"
5070.900,5071.400," Earth"
5075.600,5076.200," so we'll be"
5078.700,5080.800," we'll be approaching that a little bit more"
5081.600,5082.900," as a cow and"
5084.200,5084.700," next week"
5086.200,5087.900," what is that strange sentence"
5089.200,5089.900," inviting us"
5090.800,5091.200," into"
5093.100,5094.400," my mind is"
5095.500,5096.000," the mountains"
5096.700,5097.200," the rivers"
5098.300,5099.000," the great Earth"
5101.400,5104.300," and I can't help mentioning related to this the Great"
5104.900,5106.000," master dogen"
5107.000,5108.000," poet master"
5108.900,5110.200," author philosopher"
5111.500,5113.100," all around wizard"
5113.500,5113.800," of"
5115.200,5116.700," practice and"
5117.900,5119.100," teaching and"
5120.000,5121.500," understanding our human condition"
5122.400,5122.600," in"
5123.100,5124.000," radical ways"
5126.500,5129.000," from the 13th century he once wrote a"
5130.000,5133.800," Sutra as he called it instead of a more like an essay really"
5134.300,5138.200," is that a deep practice latch philosophical essay"
5138.700,5140.800," call the mountains and Rivers"
5141.400,5142.100," Sutra"
5143.600,5146.700," and the word Sutra you know is is a"
5146.900,5149.200," the Buddhist term for the early scriptures"
5150.300,5151.300," the sutras are"
5151.900,5154.700," are the term actually is totally"
5155.600,5157.300," cognate with our word suture"
5157.800,5158.600," you know a stitch"
5159.600,5159.700," and"
5160.800,5164.700," somehow these futures stitch the teaching together or something I'm not sure exactly"
5165.200,5165.300," but"
5165.900,5167.700," the mountain is a Rivers suture"
5168.700,5169.300," you'd think"
5169.900,5173.100," I mean it's a clever title really an a beautiful title because it"
5173.800,5176.900," you think it means you come to it thinking it means"
5177.700,5181.700," here is going to be a lovely piece of writing about mountains and Rivers"
5182.400,5184.700," but the whole thing is actually trying to evoke"
5185.600,5186.200," the fact that"
5187.000,5188.100," the mountains"
5188.600,5190.700," and the rivers are themselves"
5192.300,5192.900," the Sutra"
5193.800,5194.400," the teaching"
5195.100,5197.900," the mountains and rivers are directly"
5199.100,5199.500," our"
5200.300,5200.800," nature"
5201.700,5202.600," inviting us"
5203.600,5204.900," to recognise this self"
5205.800,5207.000," to recognise it"
5207.800,5209.900," so that's just a taste or next week"
5210.500,5212.400," and we get into more of the sort of command"
5212.900,5213.600," territory"
5214.200,5214.700," of this"
5215.500,5215.800," where"
5217.000,5218.300," it's less about"
5219.200,5220.000," what does"
5221.300,5222.800," what does you know what is"
5223.300,5224.100," Henry or"
5224.500,5225.400," have to learn or"
5226.200,5228.400," you know or any of us have to learn"
5229.200,5229.800," in this"
5230.800,5234.200," in the context of nature which again is a vast topic and we're only"
5234.700,5236.200," touching a little snippets here in there"
5237.600,5237.700," but"
5238.200,5240.000," not really that so much"
5240.500,5244.600," in our next session is more what is actually the true relationship"
5245.200,5246.500," what is the true relationship"
5250.000,5252.400," many levels are which is exchanged of course"
5255.200,5256.800," which is a great lesson for us in"
5257.700,5258.700," in this in the"
5259.900,5261.100," weird world"
5261.600,5262.300," is that what it's called"
5264.400,5264.600," why"
5265.000,5266.300," educated industrialized"
5268.300,5268.700," rich"
5269.100,5270.600," democratic something like that"
5272.600,5273.200," you heard that term"
5274.100,5275.200," the term uses days"
5275.600,5278.300," in the weird world we need to be reminded"
5279.200,5281.200," that we are indeed in a"
5282.100,5283.000," condition of"
5284.300,5287.300," receiving and need to reciprocate it with every"
5287.600,5288.600," moment of our lives"
5289.700,5290.200," you know and"
5290.900,5292.500," recognition of that is critical"
5293.100,5295.500," and what to do about it then is beyond further"
5295.900,5296.600," further steps"
5298.900,5299.100," but"

5347.700,5348.200," doesn't there"
5349.000,5350.200," at work some"
5351.200,5353.600," I don't know just some sort of expression of a"
5354.300,5357.300," growth energy I don't know what to call that exactly"
5358.100,5361.700," but anyway Scott let's please um please unmute and"
5363.500,5364.200," if you can"

5372.900,5376.000," to be here and I was at mountain club last year one of his retreats so"
5376.800,5377.800," great to connect here"
5378.800,5380.800," can I just ask could you tell us where you are"
5381.600,5384.500," yes I'm originally from London but I'm down in Seaford"
5385.200,5386.100," in the UK you might know"
5387.400,5387.900," nice yeah"
5388.400,5389.400," great Devin right"
5390.600,5393.400," not so much Devin most some East Sussex"
5394.000,5397.100," oh sorry sorry over there okay not definitely at all right way over yeah"
5397.500,5398.200," southeast got it"
5398.800,5399.300," okay thanks"
5401.100,5405.700," it's quite interesting I was down in the sea last night and also this morning and those really thinking a lot about"
5407.000,5408.800," being in those moments of Flo and"
5409.400,5410.200," and presents and"
5411.300,5416.800," and I'm actually a student of consciousness myself I'm doing a Master's in consciousness at the moment with the LF trust and"
5418.300,5422.600," in a reading a book at the moment by Antonio damasio is a neuroscientist and the neurologists"
5423.300,5425.600," and if you know his work and he talks about this work of"
5426.100,5429.300," that is core consciousness and then there's extended consciousness"
5430.500,5430.600," and"
5431.900,5433.600," it's want to share that idea about"
5433.900,5434.300," sort of"
5436.700,5438.800," almost like this idea that we're really"
5439.300,5442.500," dropping into core consciousness through our through our practice"
5443.600,5444.100," yet also"
5444.600,5445.800," what's our relationship with"
5446.400,5452.400," the aalto realm of consciousness too and how do we relate to that because I have a busy mind probably everyone on this"
5453.300,5457.800," call has a busy mind be at caught up in our projections our dreams and hopes ambitions and"
5458.900,5465.400," sometimes I find it quite confusing to relate to that busy mind and then coming back into that sense of presence and then"
5466.200,5470.700," understanding what steps to take forward and my relationship between those two levels of consciousness"
5472.200,5477.100," yeah lovely well here's a here's a thought on that theme of course there's many teachings"
5477.800,5483.400," around this matter you know what is consciousness or what are are there different kinds of consciousness"
5484.000,5485.300," and there's many ways of"
5486.100,5488.000," dicing and slicing it and sort of"
5488.400,5489.900," carving it up conceptually"
5490.400,5493.400," but one one way we could think about it is that essentially where"
5494.100,5495.000," you know when normally"
5496.700,5498.300," and this is actually borrowing from"
5501.000,5501.500," just"
5501.900,5504.500," blanking on his name mingya rinse you know he says you know"
5505.100,5506.000," normally with sort of"
5506.400,5510.000," with we're caught in this raging river of thoughts and feelings"
5510.900,5513.500," and the first thing to do is to get out of the river"
5514.200,5515.400," to get onto the riverbank"
5516.100,5518.100," so that we're not actually being tumbled"
5518.800,5523.500," we maybe still wet and but we haven't got a chance to actually get out of the"
5524.400,5526.800," stream the rush of thoughts and feelings"
5527.600,5529.000," and then from that vantage"
5530.200,5536.400," maybe it's core consciousness I mean many were just call him mindfulness or mindful awareness or mindful presence"
5537.000,5538.700," from that vantage we can see"
5540.000,5542.900," thoughts and feelings without being caught in them"
5543.500,5544.600," we've got to a place"
5545.300,5547.100," of you know the quantum witness"
5548.500,5550.400," where we can be aware"
5551.400,5552.700," not only of"
5553.300,5556.200," sight and sounds but also of internal"
5557.200,5557.400," weather"
5557.900,5560.700," consisting basically of thoughts and feelings emotions"
5561.800,5561.900," and"
5562.700,5563.600," once we've"
5564.300,5567.800," tapped into a sort of residing back in that"
5568.800,5571.700," presence that mindful awareness"
5572.800,5579.200," then there is an invitation if we're curious to well what actually is this awareness anyway"
5579.600,5581.000," that we're now in"
5581.600,5583.300," you know and and that's where"
5584.000,5585.100," we might"
5586.600,5588.200," we might start exploring"
5589.300,5591.000," you know how how big is it"
5592.000,5593.600," where does it begin an end you know"
5594.200,5596.100," what does it have to do with me"
5597.300,5600.600," is this awareness actually mine"
5601.600,5602.600," or is it somehow"
5603.600,5606.700," a pre-existing condition within which"
5607.400,5608.600," the idea of me"
5609.700,5610.300," arises"
5612.000,5612.100," so"
5612.700,5617.500," I don't know I don't I don't totally heard of Antonio damasio I haven't actually haven't"
5618.300,5619.600," I don't think I've read anything"
5620.200,5620.900," of his butt"
5621.400,5621.800," but I'm"
5622.400,5623.300," but you know there's"
5624.400,5628.000," there's a lot of different ways that traditions and researchers have"
5628.500,5629.000," actually"
5629.500,5630.700," tried to delineate"
5631.300,5632.200," sort of different"
5632.800,5634.600," different registers of"
5635.900,5637.800," awareness that we can experience but I think"
5638.400,5640.100," locked by and large so sort of"
5642.100,5643.900," but they're all kind of I think agree on"
5644.200,5645.300," maybe the terminology might"
5645.600,5647.900," shift but agree on the terminal on the"
5648.400,5649.400," on the idea sort of"
5650.700,5655.400," there's a major distinction between just getting being caught up in things mmm"
5656.000,5656.600," vs"
5657.600,5659.000," suddenly being aware"
5660.300,5663.200," that we've been caught up in things and now we're not"
5663.800,5665.400," and it's qualitatively different"
5665.900,5666.500," to be"
5667.800,5668.500," resting"
5669.200,5669.400," in"
5669.900,5670.400," an awareness"
5671.500,5672.200," that knows"
5674.200,5674.600," I'm here"
5677.600,5677.600," yeah"
5678.400,5679.100," so thank you"
5679.700,5680.300," thank you thank you"
5680.900,5682.000," god thanks for being on great"
5682.800,5683.600," ok now would"
5684.200,5684.800," I'm looking at any other"
5686.800,5687.200," any other"
5687.600,5690.600," hands race and not seeing okay Carl him-"
5693.600,5695.100," if you can hi Henry"
5695.700,5699.200," I'm English but I'm talking to you from San Francisco where I live"
5700.200,5700.400," and"
5702.000,5705.300," I come to you through the the way up and through"
5707.200,5708.600," our buddy Sam Harris"
5709.500,5709.800," and"
5711.800,5715.800," a medium experience meditator I have a question about"
5716.600,5717.900," eyes open eyes closed"
5718.800,5719.100," I've"
5720.100,5723.400," I generally meditate with eyes closed but I've recently"
5723.900,5727.200," thanks to you actually Madeley thanks to your Memoir"
5727.700,5730.600," I've been experimenting with doing longer sets on my own"
5731.400,5737.100," with no prompting to sits as in and and I've tried to follow the eyes open"
5738.400,5742.000," discipline and I find it incredibly distracting"
5742.300,5746.900," that the the real world the real world transmitting in through my eyes"
5747.600,5751.800," just grabs hold a Beat and and I and I had appreciate your comments about"
5752.600,5760.400," whether I should whether I should persist with the eyes open whether I should alternate what are your thoughts about that the it's a classic"
5760.900,5763.300," Sam Harris talks about it all time you know that the"
5764.700,5768.800," our vision our vision really grabs us right so an appreciate some commentary"
5769.800,5774.200," yes thank you very much I suspect that might be part of the wisdom of the traditions"
5774.600,5777.700," that go either way the wisdom of closing the eyes"
5779.000,5779.300," therefore"
5779.900,5781.900," making this slightly more sealed kind of"
5782.900,5785.100," chamber within which meditative"
5786.200,5787.100," practice can be done"
5788.300,5791.900," versus actually those that say no hope keep the eyes open"
5792.600,5793.800," precisely because"
5794.900,5797.400," we want to be cultivating and awareness"
5798.000,5799.700," that is in some ways"
5800.900,5803.500," almost indifferent to circumstances"
5804.200,5804.500," that is"
5804.900,5809.800," that is not what maybe that's not quite the right way putting with but it's almost it's not going to be a sailable bye"
5810.300,5812.900," different circumstances and if 70% of our"
5813.500,5814.000," you know our"
5815.200,5818.700," political processing or whatever mental processing is visual"
5819.600,5820.800," then that's a big chunk"
5821.400,5821.800," to be"
5822.700,5823.400," learning"
5824.200,5826.600," to let be and not get caught up in"
5826.900,5829.400," if it's sort of in others there's Wisdom both ways"
5830.100,5832.300," because yeah there's the wisdom of let's make it easier"
5833.100,5834.800," and you know let's let's have this sort of"
5835.400,5838.100," rather more as it were secluded chamber"
5838.400,5840.100," for doing our meditative explorations"
5840.900,5841.800," all the wisdom and I"
5842.400,5843.100," well no no no"
5843.600,5845.000," precisely because we want to be"
5846.100,5847.700," generally more aware"
5848.300,5850.200," both while meditating and throughout life"
5850.700,5851.500," let's Learn"
5852.500,5854.400," to let the visual feel be"
5855.500,5858.500," really the same way that we let the auditory field be"
5859.400,5860.700," in meditation you know we don't"
5861.200,5863.000," block our ears when we meditating"
5863.300,5867.700," yeah it's we understand somehow it's the drop it to drop the the sounds"
5868.200,5875.200," that's well you as a as a medium term meditator you'll have had plenty of time to get used to doing it with your eyes closed"
5875.800,5877.300," so there is definitely a transition"
5877.900,5878.900," to be gone through"
5879.500,5881.400," and so you need to allow for that"
5881.900,5882.500," but if you just"
5882.900,5884.300," decide your resolve"
5884.900,5888.700," I don't know whatever the length of time is but for the next you know week or two or something"
5889.100,5890.700," I'm only going to sit with eyes open"
5891.400,5891.700," for example"
5892.600,5893.400," then"
5894.400,5894.600," if"
5894.900,5900.200," you should have time to go through the transition now there's a few tips on having eyes open"
5900.800,5902.000," one is they usually say"
5903.200,5906.100," you know sort of straight ahead but the gay is lowered"
5906.900,5908.600," like don't be looking after either side just"
5909.700,5911.100," eyes I said a resting at"
5911.500,5914.300," I don't know 30 to 45 degrees downward"
5917.500,5919.200," and the that's one"
5919.900,5921.900," sort of pointer another is"
5923.300,5928.100," we'll in zen the as you might know that you typically sit facing a wall"
5928.600,5929.700," I've been doing that yeah"
5930.000,5932.300," okay that's good because that and that's again"
5932.800,5933.100," is it's"
5933.400,5936.100," I think it's partly just the pragmatic reasons of having"
5936.600,5938.600," less to get distracted by"
5939.500,5940.100," you know and"
5940.600,5943.900," I remember once setting up a retreat for one of my teachers in a"
5944.900,5949.900," in some other not in a Zen centre but in some building with rented for the retreat"
5950.500,5951.900," and I'd put all these"
5952.500,5953.000," cushions"
5954.000,5955.700," against this wall that had"
5956.800,5957.900," low windows"
5958.700,5961.900," that were instead of I think for ventilation I thought this is really nice lovely"
5962.700,5968.400," and she said what are you doing you know we've got a cover those windows you know precisely thickness"
5969.000,5972.400," people might look out and get distracted so yeah wall is good"
5976.400,5977.200," so then okay"
5977.700,5978.500," another point"
5979.200,5981.200," that's more sort of internal in a sense"
5981.700,5983.300," is what which what we're hoping"
5985.200,5987.000," will happen and really can happen"
5987.800,5989.500," is that the visual field"
5990.300,5991.000," becomes"
5992.000,5994.400," no more interesting than"
5995.200,5995.800," the wall"
5996.700,5999.000," that we start to see that you know even if I'm"
5999.700,6004.900," looking across my room and there's a window and traffic outside in a tree in a wind and"
6005.200,6007.500," lots of stuff going on stuff on my desk"
6008.300,6009.000," all of that"
6009.800,6011.100," becomes like a screen"
6012.300,6014.100," it's just a display"
6015.500,6015.700," and"
6016.200,6017.800," I'm perfectly capable"
6018.500,6019.500," I was just being here"
6020.300,6020.900," aware"
6021.800,6025.400," aware of that screen with all its essentially"
6025.800,6027.000," basically colours"
6027.900,6028.700," and shapes and"
6029.400,6030.200," light and dark"
6031.100,6031.900," patterns maybe"
6032.500,6036.800," I'm perfectly capable of being aware of the fullness of that screen of sais it's just like a"
6037.500,6038.300," it's just a sort of"
6039.200,6039.800," roundish"
6041.600,6044.000," you know screen with stuff on it"
6044.900,6046.500," and I could navigate it freely"
6047.100,6050.800," but there's no reason why that need disturb my"
6051.500,6052.500," basically being aware"
6053.900,6054.500," any more than"
6055.300,6056.900," hearing the sound field around me"
6057.700,6058.500," need to sew"
6059.500,6060.800," it's just another"
6061.500,6061.900," channel"
6062.400,6063.600," of sense experience"
6064.600,6065.600," and awareness"
6067.100,6067.500," actually"
6068.400,6070.300," I mean it's you know I guess a little complex but"
6070.900,6075.600," awareness is what is allowing us to be aware of that sense channel"
6076.400,6078.000," awareness in some sense"
6078.800,6080.200," is larger than it"
6080.700,6084.300," it's like a kind of disc almost floating in a wider"
6084.800,6085.300," nameless"
6086.000,6086.800," something you know"
6087.400,6088.400," which we might call awareness"
6089.200,6092.000," or you know but but it's actually it doesn't"
6094.600,6101.300," and how do we get there well and another little tip I hope this is interesting for others as well that one day they might want to try this"
6101.800,6103.000," another little tip is that"
6103.600,6103.800," well"
6105.100,6112.500," we want to be shifting from the pointer you know the little laser points are in the eyes there's a term for that I've just now forgotten"
6112.900,6117.600," where we're you know looking at a particular point and where aware that we're looking at a particular point"
6118.000,6119.300," we want to switch that off"
6120.300,6120.600," basically"
6121.400,6122.000," and just"
6122.800,6125.400," narrow to walk narrow to White Focus to me"
6127.200,6131.700," narrow not nessus something yeah yes I think yeah yeah exactly something like that exactly"
6132.200,6133.800," so we're in wide angle lens"
6134.600,6136.000," to letting it all be present"
6136.600,6136.800," and"
6137.500,6144.600," just you know but but but then again we don't want to be too caught up in dealing with visual the visual field"
6145.000,6146.000," we want to really just be"
6146.500,6147.500," letting it be there"
6148.500,6152.200," and then are you following the breath or whether you're aware of this or that whatever you're doing"
6153.000,6153.800," be doing that"
6154.400,6156.000," while letting the visual field"
6156.600,6157.400," just do it's thing"
6159.700,6159.900," thank you"
6160.600,6164.400," okay so you could you confirmed that my my suspicions that really"
6165.200,6169.100," really want me to be meditating eyes open and I'm totally game to go for that"
6169.700,6173.200," and if I don't want to hug the meeting here so what the fault the follow up is"
6173.600,6179.200," I'm about I don't know number 10 Retreat 10 on the way and this I see there's lots and lots and lots and lots to go"
6179.700,6184.200," so far you've been very clear you don't don't get distracted here close your eyes"
6185.100,6196.100," are you going to do you mind revealing to you know I know you don't like reveal your secrets but but but are you prepared to say that you know I later on are you going to encourage me to do that on the way"
6197.300,6201.100," There's Gonna Be points where there are eyes open meditations yes"
6201.800,6207.900," but I like to actually leave it open which somebody wants to do is up to them on the whole I do say"
6208.400,6211.300," you know most of you have eyes closed but if you want them open it's okay"
6212.700,6214.100," but there's going to be yeah"
6215.500,6216.800," cool it's just put a chat"
6217.300,6221.900," it's coming in the 30s okay well I got I've got many days to go then"
6223.200,6223.900," okay- thanks"
6226.200,6228.500," okay now any anybody else um"
6229.400,6235.200," wanna okay I'm going to I'm just gonna look in the chat again where to look in two dimensions"
6235.600,6240.000," keep the guys try to once but allow it to move around how deep to look"
6241.700,6245.100," yeah kid I said there's another comment about these Eyes I'll just address this"
6246.300,6249.800," where to look into dimensions that the eyes have so many ways"
6252.000,6253.700," to be controlled makes it harder for me"
6254.300,6258.400," where to look into the most is keep the guys precisely on one spot or allowed to move around"
6259.100,6260.000," yeah okay so"
6260.500,6262.700," let me just say yeah this is a good points"
6263.100,6263.300," um"
6265.200,6268.300," did I look deep stereoscopy and or in terms of focal length"
6268.600,6269.700," the best thing"
6270.500,6271.600," is to be"
6272.600,6273.200," lightly"
6275.500,6277.100," to tuning out the focus actually"
6278.000,6282.400," now but this works this is easier to do with that when it's a bare wall in front of you"
6283.100,6283.900," and you just kind of"
6286.400,6287.300," just sort of"
6288.400,6290.700," it's really like letting it be there"
6292.100,6294.400," but you're not focusing on anything in particular"
6296.800,6297.700," it's some"
6297.900,6299.900," I remember one of my teachers saying"
6300.300,6303.900," it's like you're looking into the middle distance beyond the wall"
6305.200,6306.000," so it's as if"
6306.500,6308.300," I mean that wasn't meant to be some"
6309.100,6312.100," you know sort of metaphysical invitation but it's more just like"
6312.800,6315.200," your eyes are in a state of soft focus"
6315.900,6318.600," as if they were as if they were gazing into the middle distance"
6319.900,6322.300," and so you're just letting what is a rising"
6322.900,6323.400," in Vision"
6324.200,6324.800," arise"
6325.600,6327.700," but you're kind of not engaging with it"
6331.600,6333.600," okay let's keep going"
6334.600,6335.400," any other"
6337.300,6337.900," any other"
6339.900,6346.300," somebody actually has got an interesting point here Scott if you look at one spot you'll find the brain starts from images of a face it's an interesting experience to be aware of"
6346.600,6352.100," yeah I found that too what's going on there is there's a sort of actual blending of outward seeing"
6352.600,6355.200," with inward seeing and inwards seeing means"
6357.900,6358.500," imaginings"
6359.000,6359.500," and they can"
6360.100,6362.600," interpose in a superimpose on one another"
6363.000,6364.500," okay Paul him-"
6373.500,6375.800," Paul are you I don't know where Paul went"
6376.300,6377.200," Paul can you raise your hand again"
6378.600,6379.600," other you I find you"
6381.900,6382.000," right"
6384.800,6386.600," okay pulley you gotta unmute"
6388.200,6389.400," all's not unmuted yet"
6390.600,6391.300," there we go"
6392.200,6392.800," okay hey"
6393.500,6396.500," hi thanks I'm gonna try to"
6397.200,6402.400," do this as quickly as possible this kind of convoluted but as you're from the"
6403.300,6407.500," kind of out of nowhere as you were talking about your speculation about what does nature"
6408.500,6412.400," aspire to or not aspire to and you got into the river and and I'm thinking"
6413.600,6416.700," you know Rivers move Waters move the question that came up is"
6417.700,6418.000," Henry"
6418.600,6423.500," would there be a distinction or how would you make a distinction between the waters and the river"
6424.600,6425.800," and then your story kept going"
6426.800,6428.800," and it resolved this self and a strange way"
6429.800,6431.000," um which is"
6431.700,6436.700," as you're 60 or 60% is in the water of of yourself that's water is in the water"
6438.600,6440.000," and you get out of the water"
6441.400,6443.600," and you're taking the water with you because you're wet"
6444.400,6445.700," and even though you dry"
6446.400,6448.000," you're still not totally dry"
6449.300,6452.900," and as the water evaporates whatever is left is is on you"
6453.800,6455.000," and in a very real way"
6456.400,6457.900," the distinctions all dissolve"
6459.000,6462.500," but between the water the river Henry Paul listening"
6463.800,6464.000," can't"
6464.400,6467.000," you know dry can't get wet wet can't get dry"
6468.800,6470.500," and it sort of resolved itself in this"
6471.100,6472.200," really beautiful way"
6474.500,6475.100," that I think"
6478.000,6478.800," in two"
6479.600,6480.300," in number two"
6481.400,6482.100," makes available"
6482.800,6483.500," in support"
6484.400,6485.600," and if you could"
6486.000,6487.400," anyway I I love that"
6488.200,6493.500," these things as you know when you started talking this way when the questions become resolutions they don't make any sense"
6494.200,6497.300," except in graph experience but you know anyway"
6498.200,6499.700," any thoughts about that"
6500.300,6503.100," yeah lovely lovely well it just brought up for me um"
6504.100,6506.900," I forgot there's a colour and about a stone"
6507.600,6509.800," a stone in the bottom of the sea the Cohen says"
6510.300,6512.800," get this stone from the bottom of the sea"
6513.300,6515.200," without getting your hands wet"
6516.300,6518.000," it's like what that talking about"
6518.700,6523.500," and then and then it goes on it says on the stone there's a name what is the name and then it says"
6524.100,6526.400," on one side it says can't get wet"
6526.900,6529.000," and on the other side it says can't get"
6529.200,6529.700," dry"
6530.100,6531.400," exactly and and"
6531.900,6533.600," this this sort of started with"
6534.400,6535.100," with her"
6535.500,6536.700," with the guy who said"
6537.500,6538.400," I was raised"
6539.100,6539.800," by a river"
6541.000,6541.900," and she said"
6542.900,6555.000," that's a slippery river rocket itself yes so good they just a slippery wrist slippery a description of smooth and slippery as a River Rock"
6555.900,6558.400," so look so for some this will be like a little bit"
6559.000,6561.000," in screwable was Henry talking about"
6561.400,6563.200," so we don't need to go there too much now"
6563.700,6567.300," but this is we're entering Cohen land a bit where"
6567.900,6571.200," ah what gets wet what gets dry who am I"
6571.800,6574.900," what is the limits of me what is not me what is me"
6576.300,6578.800," what am I really what is the world really"
6580.200,6583.500," and what a rivers and what a mountains and"
6583.900,6586.900," and we can take it all in so many different ways you know and it's"
6587.400,6590.700," and it's can be so helpful in so many different ways that we don't want to"
6591.500,6592.100," we don't want to"
6593.400,6598.400," we just want to be open to all of it all the multiple ways that we can actually be helped"
6598.900,6601.600," that's really the heart of this stone too is"
6602.200,6604.900," you know if we just get the recognition that we're not alone"
6606.500,6608.200," you know it's all ready"
6609.500,6614.000," doors and windows open to our vulnerability you know we we have a"
6614.500,6616.700," chunk of vulnerability help comes"
6617.800,6618.400," you know and"
6619.000,6621.700," and we just it's just so easy for us to"
6622.400,6625.400," think we kind of know what's going on and we know"
6626.100,6629.300," how things should be we know what the answers in life should be"
6630.700,6631.500," and and"
6632.100,6633.000," the deeper"
6634.500,6635.500," issues of life"
6636.300,6638.900," and the deepest problems that we might face in life"
6639.700,6640.800," are not like that"
6641.900,6643.700," you know the the all of us"
6644.200,6645.800," at times They're gonna"
6646.300,6646.900," meet"
6647.200,6649.500," things we cannot get our heads around"
6650.600,6654.200," and that's a mercy actually although it often doesn't seem it"
6654.800,6655.600," it you know and so"
6656.300,6661.300," just a sort of the more open we can that's why zen has such a"
6662.300,6663.700," emphasis on not"
6664.200,6664.700," knowing"
6666.100,6666.900," you know they say"
6667.500,6668.500," I remember one of my teachers"
6670.600,6673.300," I don't know there's some kind of remember the circumstances I was"
6675.700,6677.400," but it was sort of like you know I I"
6677.900,6682.000," maybe I'd been sitting with a coin or something like I couldn't get anywhere with it and I just"
6682.700,6683.900," I came in and said well"
6684.600,6685.500," god I just don't know"
6686.500,6689.500," you just smiled and said well you know in Zen"
6689.800,6692.100," you always get good points for not knowing"
6695.400,6704.800," but it's it's because it's not just about zen it's about you know are the reality of our existential situation is that we just don't know and with great that we have these"
6705.300,6708.700," attempts to understand things better like botany like"
6709.200,6711.900," you know all the levels of Science and like psychology and like"
6712.300,6714.100," all or you know all of it is good"
6715.100,6716.700," but the fundamental"
6717.000,6718.900," issue matter of what"
6719.300,6721.800," actually is it to exist"
6722.800,6723.700," and I suppose we have to add"
6724.200,6724.800," consciously"
6727.100,6727.400," that"
6729.700,6730.000," you know"
6730.500,6733.200," is one of the quote hard problems"
6734.300,6739.300," you know meaning science hasn't got a handle on it they're trying to you know the brilliant"
6739.800,6740.900," Francis Crick Who"
6741.400,6743.700," discovered the dollar double helix nature of the"
6744.400,6745.500," of the DNA"
6746.200,6749.500," he spent a you know next 50 years of his career"
6749.900,6751.000," trying to solve that"
6751.700,6759.200," just think of there's got to be neural correlates of consciousness at least we could get those and I can't even I haven't even got those yet"
6759.900,6760.100," and"
6760.900,6761.800," and even if you"
6762.200,6762.700," could"
6763.300,6764.000," it wouldn't"
6764.400,6766.200," actually help explain"
6767.200,6768.700," what consciousness is"
6771.800,6773.000," it's the miracle"
6773.700,6774.200," therefore"
6774.800,6775.500," the wonder"
6776.000,6776.600," the all"
6777.300,6780.200," is all due to this moment right"
6780.600,6781.000," now"
6781.700,6783.900," and not ever any other"
6785.200,6786.500," always this moment"
6787.100,6788.500," now because this here"
6789.000,6790.600," is the one place where"
6791.600,6792.400," experience"
6792.900,6793.500," awareness"
6793.800,6794.100," is"
6795.900,6796.100," here"
6797.700,6798.700," okay so let's go"
6799.400,6801.900," I think we're going to wind up Sean I see you got a hand up but"
6802.200,6803.400," we'll come to you next time"
6804.000,6804.200," because"
6805.100,6807.600," I don't want to run a server thank you very much"
6808.400,6812.400," and I want to thank everybody very much for joining this course and"
6813.100,6814.200," you know we're always a little bit"
6817.100,6821.000," are you serve and you know it's like hints and nudges and not"
6821.900,6824.600," here's laying it out this is the answer because we don't have them"
6825.200,6825.600," we're just"
6826.300,6829.300," extracted as a matter of your exploration your journey"
6829.900,6830.100," and"
6830.600,6831.500," just please remember"
6832.400,6832.800," that the"
6833.300,6834.000," unknown"
6834.700,6835.800," is probably"
6836.300,6837.200," the right direction"
6838.500,6842.200," in so far as there might beer anything like a right direction"
6842.700,6843.600," it's generally"
6844.300,6846.000," into what we do not know"
6848.400,6849.900," in other words we can't know where we're going"
6850.300,6851.200," if we go in the right way"
6853.000,6853.200," okay"
6854.000,6856.400," so thank you very much everybody and Luke I'm going to"
6857.000,6858.900," hand it right back to you for any closing"
6859.900,6861.500," info or comments or anything"
6864.200,6865.000," and thanks everybody"
