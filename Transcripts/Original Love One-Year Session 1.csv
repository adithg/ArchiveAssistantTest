234.200,234.500," until"

237.600,238.400," night I was"
239.500,244.200," in Costa Rica leading a retreat with my dear old friend David White"
244.900,245.200," so very"
245.700,246.700," powerful beautiful"
247.200,250.500," retreat in an amazing place it was a set of threading together a poetry"
251.100,251.800," and Dharma"
252.300,252.500," with"
253.900,257.000," just over a hundred people in a most incredibly beautiful place and"
257.600,259.700," very sort of powerful fantastic event I think"
260.500,264.100," but certainly for us to and seem to be like for everybody"
264.900,265.100," then"
265.800,268.200," Friday all day travelling home till late"
268.900,270.300," and then yesterday"
271.500,272.000," Saturday"
272.600,273.700," I actually woke up"
274.300,275.900," feeling kind of a little often"
276.500,278.300," turned out I had a temperature a fever"
278.900,281.300," spent most of the day in bed most of the day sleeping"
282.100,284.100," and I really didn't want to"
284.900,285.400," um"
286.400,286.700," you know"
287.300,291.600," we'll have to pull out of this event today I'm so excited about it"
292.100,292.600," and actually"
293.100,297.100," I just had this hunch that whatever this thing was might just be a brief thing"
297.800,299.200," and sure enough I woke up"
299.700,300.400," back to normal"
300.900,302.100," you know normal temperature"
302.900,303.800," feeling pretty good"
304.400,304.900," but also"
305.700,307.600," just a little bit sort of frail so"
309.000,309.400," I'm just"
310.500,312.200," conscious of needing to kind of"
312.600,314.000," husband my resources"
314.700,314.800," and"
315.900,317.000," and try to just be"
318.800,319.700," really in a sort of a"
320.400,323.200," steady place so I just wanted to share that with you so you know"
324.200,325.500," a little bit where I'm coming from"
326.200,328.600," but above all and actually"
329.800,331.700," most of all I'm feeling this kind of"
333.600,335.900," rather full of this sense of a sort of tender"
337.300,338.500," great for"
339.200,339.800," excitement"
341.100,341.500," at"
341.800,343.600," the prospect of starting"
344.200,345.700," a whole new year"
346.600,347.600," of original love"
348.300,349.000," gatherings"
349.700,352.000," and this I feel very very lucky to"
352.900,355.100," be able to be part of this"
356.100,356.500," um"
356.800,358.400," this kind of gather"
359.100,360.000," to be a"
360.600,362.700," along with a great team we got Jeremy"
363.100,365.900," and Luke and Shanna and Sarah"
366.600,369.000," all helping to make this happen on"
369.500,370.700," you know something like a"
371.500,373.500," bi-weekly basis right through the year"
374.200,374.200," so"
375.000,376.800," thanks to all of you for coming on"
377.200,378.400," of course you you are"
378.800,379.900," in the end what makes it happen"
380.700,384.300," with you know a little bit of help from us but basically you guys make it happen"
384.900,385.900," so thank you very very much"
391.500,392.700," well we're going to begin"
393.400,393.800," with"
394.400,394.900," a set"
396.800,397.900," we're going to begin by"
399.200,402.000," the most basic kind of coming home"
402.800,404.300," which is just coming home"
405.300,406.400," to this moment"
407.400,408.300," which means"
409.800,411.700," that wherever our attention"
412.500,412.900," has been"
415.000,415.100," we"
416.400,419.100," we just do this little gentle thing of tethering"
420.600,422.900," tethering it and just pulling it back"
423.700,425.100," gently pulling it back"
426.700,427.600," again and again"
428.200,429.100," you know so that"
429.500,430.700," we start to"
432.600,433.100," deepen"
434.100,435.500," our habitation"
436.900,438.000," of Here and Now"
440.100,441.300," because on one level we're"
441.800,446.000," we're pulling back our mind repeatedly when it's wondered which it naturally turns"
447.000,450.100," but on another Level also we're actually expanding"
451.500,452.400," our awareness"
453.500,454.300," Here and Now"
456.100,456.300," and"
457.100,462.200," when we're doing that as our awareness of Here and Now in the here now is expanding"
463.200,463.500," actually"
464.100,464.700," our mind"
465.500,467.900," can Wonder more and we remain aware"
469.300,470.300," it's like that image"
471.200,473.400," that shouldn't use Suzuki roshi"
474.000,478.400," had that you many of you will have heard me Cher before of being like the mayor"
478.900,479.900," with her foal"
480.700,483.300," that we want to give the folder wide meta"
484.300,485.600," the frolic and Gamble"
486.100,486.400," in"
487.200,489.400," but we the man the mum"
490.000,490.900," stay aware"
492.100,493.100," of the whole Meadow"
494.600,495.300," even while"
495.600,496.400," the little foal"
496.800,498.200," is skipping around it"
499.400,501.000," okay so let's come into"
501.600,502.800," whatever suits you"
504.500,506.800," right now as a meditation posture"
523.200,524.400," okay so"
525.300,526.600," coming in to"
527.800,527.900," your"
528.600,528.900," comfortable"
529.500,530.200," seated position"
532.800,533.500," that's great"
537.800,538.000," and"
540.000,540.400," letting"
545.200,546.900," Letting yourself feel your seat"
557.100,558.300," the feel your"
559.900,560.700," anchoring"
561.900,562.000," to"
564.200,564.800," the Earth"
568.000,568.800," through your seat"
569.400,570.500," and through your feet"
584.000,587.000," I rather like to have a very soft entry"
587.500,589.000," into meditation these days"
590.000,592.700," not like a hardened fast before and after"
593.900,597.200," so just a I'm just going to share a bit how I do just to"
597.900,599.200," be in where I'm at"
600.300,602.100," and I'm just starting to be still"
604.000,604.700," that there's no"
605.800,607.100," hard line"
607.700,608.300," I'm crossing"
609.900,610.100," from"
610.600,612.600," Nan meditating to meditate"
616.700,618.600," and just gradually inviting"
622.200,624.800," and a little bit of an expansion of the awareness"
626.200,626.600," of the"
627.300,629.200," kind of baseline experience"
631.000,631.600," being here"
633.100,633.900," right where I am"
639.800,641.700," so there's the connection to the Earth"
645.800,647.000," and then feeling that"
649.100,650.900," let Your Body relax"
652.000,654.000," that's where more conscious of our"
655.300,657.200," connectedness to the Earth"
659.900,661.500," we align with gravity"
664.700,664.900," so"
665.600,668.400," you know make little adjustments you can Sway"
669.300,669.700," and rock"
670.900,672.100," very gently by buying"
674.100,674.900," the vertical"
676.400,678.000," that's assuming you're sitting with a back"
678.400,678.900," for free"
679.600,682.800," and if you're not that's just great just recline and give yourself"
683.900,685.200," to the support behind him"
689.100,690.500," either way we're"
692.400,693.600," entrusting ourselves"
695.400,696.200," to the support of the"
699.200,700.500," Earth so let you all go"
705.800,707.800," that throat and tongue go"
708.000,708.800," never be soft"
715.300,717.600," you can lower the gaze or close the eyes"
731.900,734.600,"be aware of shoulders arms and hands"
737.100,739.500," and let them be warm and clear and"
741.100,742.300," entirely at rest"
747.500,750.800," be aware of hips and and seat and"
751.900,753.100," legs and feet"
754.000,755.800," let them also be warm"
756.300,756.900," and clear"
758.000,758.900," and resting"
766.500,770.700," and let the inner volume of the trunk of the torso be wall and clear"
772.000,772.800," and resting"
776.600,779.200," and let it include the neck and throat and head"
784.100,785.700," so that the entire body"
787.500,789.500," the warm clear space"
809.700,813.600,"if you can remain aware of this warm clear space of the whole body"
814.800,815.100," and then"
816.400,818.600," open up to the space around us"
821.800,822.100," as well"
858.200,859.600," the space around us"
861.000,861.800," also has"
862.500,864.600," sounds arising within it"
865.500,866.000," kind of"
867.000,870.400," overlays or overlaps with the soundscape"
872.600,874.100," the space in which sounds"
875.500,876.200," out in the world"
877.300,878.400," including in our"
879.300,880.800," inner ears by the way"
882.200,885.100," how says the space in which sounds arrives"
904.600,907.100," so being warm and comfortable in your body"
912.900,913.600," patties"
917.500,918.100," and also"
919.800,921.900," adding your awareness somehow"
922.700,923.500," occupy"
926.000,927.000," the soundscape"
929.200,930.100," and the space around"
950.900,953.000,"resting the face resting"
953.900,954.600," the jaw"
959.000,961.100," again resting shoulders and arms"
966.900,969.700," warm rest in chest and Bell"
972.700,974.800," it hips legs and feet"
999.500,1002.100," notice there's sometimes thought will bubble up"
1003.600,1004.100," they"
1005.100,1009.500," may kind of kitchen pick us up and Carry us a little bit and then we're aware"
1009.900,1010.500," again"
1011.400,1013.500," when that's being happening just"
1014.600,1016.400," use a little label thinking"
1016.900,1017.400," so you can"
1018.500,1022.400," say that word thinking in your mind just as an acknowledgement"
1023.500,1023.700," that"
1024.100,1025.200," you know it was happening"
1026.000,1027.200," and it's just great because"
1028.300,1030.800," it's perfectly natural and because now you're back"
1032.700,1035.300," at the retroactive Mabel is very useful"
1037.300,1037.600," and then"
1038.200,1038.800," we're back here"
1050.200,1052.200," thinking really need and disturb"
1052.500,1053.200," meditation"
1053.900,1055.100," just happen now and then"
1056.400,1057.300," here we are again"
1096.600,1099.200," let's start to tune into the quiet"
1106.000,1108.100," there is a kind of quiet here"
1121.700,1123.400," that require come"
1127.800,1129.400," that it come by itself"
1134.400,1136.200," that as we go quiet"
1141.300,1142.400," we invite"
1143.900,1145.100," something like a"
1145.600,1147.200," larger choir"
1151.300,1152.300," to show itself"
1166.700,1169.600," sometimes it feels like this larger quiet"
1170.500,1173.000," and a Flows in like a tide"
1189.300,1190.700," almost like it does"
1191.700,1193.400," our meditation for us"
1208.400,1211.900," so no worries it's not like this has to happen but"
1212.600,1215.000," it's just an invitation to be aware"
1215.400,1216.400," or to be open"
1219.100,1219.400," to"
1220.300,1222.100," our own quiet"
1223.600,1225.100," inviting in"
1227.400,1229.300," deeper quiet"
1230.600,1231.500," a larger"
1232.600,1233.200," Cho"
1246.100,1247.700," the sense is really the"
1248.300,1249.400," we do less"
1252.100,1255.100," often in the first part of the meditation we're kind of"
1256.200,1258.200," somewhat doing stuff"
1258.500,1258.600," to"
1260.200,1260.800," come"
1262.300,1264.800," more balanced and it is and aware"
1270.200,1273.500," and our own quiet can invite"
1275.700,1276.900," a deeper choir"
1281.800,1282.900," The Flows In"
1286.900,1288.600," that's not of our doing"
1296.900,1300.200," but again we don't want to feel this must happen or something"
1300.600,1302.000," not at all it's just"
1303.900,1306.000," being open to the possibility"
1318.700,1319.900," resting"
1328.100,1328.500," resting"
1339.600,1341.400," Maps starting to notice"
1344.200,1345.700," that kind of"
1346.900,1348.400," a subtle love"
1350.000,1351.200," in the rest"
1356.400,1357.600," that's not move"
1359.700,1360.500," of"
1368.800,1369.700," harmony not about"
1407.700,1407.700," doing"
1505.400,1509.600," rotation now if we look at our experience"
1510.500,1511.100," right now"
1512.600,1513.800," just as it is"
1515.400,1517.300," is there really any trace"
1518.100,1519.400," of time in it"
1531.100,1533.300," in our actual experience"
1536.100,1536.900," are awareness"
1540.600,1542.100," resting awareness"
1544.500,1546.000," awareness receiving"
1552.900,1553.800," this time"
1555.400,1555.700," actually"
1557.700,1558.600," a part of it"
1559.300,1559.700," why is it"
1560.700,1561.700," time free"
1622.300,1623.200," and you"
1623.900,1625.300," see what it's like to"
1626.800,1629.300," let any sense of time drop Away"
1631.500,1633.800," as if they were a little digital clock"
1635.500,1637.300," in the corner of our awareness"
1638.100,1638.800," that is just"
1640.200,1641.100," evaporated"
1786.000,1788.600," never win the head to coming back to"
1789.700,1791.200," our restfulness"
1794.200,1794.700," rest"
1796.100,1798.600," in the body in the mind and the heart"
1806.100,1809.700," and lasting awareness emerged from restfulness"
1811.300,1813.100," the rest itself"
1815.300,1816.000," is aware"
1822.400,1824.800," and it's a sweet kind of awareness"
1826.100,1827.300," comes from"
1829.000,1829.700," resting"
1838.000,1839.600," that's really at home"
1842.400,1843.200," here and now"
1852.200,1853.400," and in Hamilton's"
1854.200,1857.000," capacity to welcome warmly"
1858.200,1859.100," anything in our"
1860.000,1862.500," in our inner experience the may not feel"
1863.900,1864.600," at home"
1866.000,1868.000," but any part of us this"
1869.100,1869.900," not quite"
1872.500,1874.700," in a state of comfort and rest"
1875.900,1876.800," and eats"
1879.600,1882.200," allowing this"
1884.400,1885.900," restful awareness to"
1886.900,1887.900," to welcome it"
1890.600,1892.100," with his larger than"
1895.400,1895.500," any"
1896.600,1899.000," particular parts of our experience"
1900.200,1902.900," you're welcome with and holds and allowance"
1904.300,1905.500," all our experience"
1912.100,1913.300," they're great"
1914.500,1915.200," guest house"
1917.700,1920.800," but well there's all"
2026.100,2026.700," rest"
2026.900,2028.300," means no eff"
2032.100,2033.500," and actually no time"
2042.300,2043.200," require"
2044.500,2045.500," that is aware"
2054.000,2055.800," and all welcoming"
2058.800,2059.500," nature"
2062.000,2063.600," allowing"
2082.500,2084.100," I think is how long to"
2085.500,2087.000," and nothing is pushed away"
2100.700,2103.100," we actually don't even have to know who we are"
2104.800,2105.600," just for now"
2107.100,2108.400," we can let that go to"
2135.400,2136.600," the niece again to"
2138.100,2140.300," the depths loving awareness"
2191.100,2193.600," was last few moments just enjoy"
2195.100,2195.800," eat rice"
2198.000,2199.200," not trying to do anything"
2304.900,2306.400,"actually"
2307.900,2311.900," the same way that we went into the meditation rather"
2313.000,2315.700," sort of gently without a hard line"
2316.900,2319.700," let's do the same emerging from"
2321.100,2321.400," it we're going to"
2322.800,2324.000," we're going to sort of go from"
2326.600,2332.900," tears really a blending a blended thing because we're going from the sit into a little five minute break"
2334.100,2335.400," and we'll reconvene"
2336.400,2339.300," at 45 minutes past the hour"
2340.100,2342.400," so you can that's six minutes away so you just sort of"
2343.100,2345.200," do what you need to do do you"
2346.300,2347.200," and I keep sitting"
2348.500,2350.600," am I going to get a cup of tea whatever"
2353.100,2354.700," but do it do it so that"
2355.300,2356.900," whatever kind of a awareness"
2357.700,2358.200," you know whatever"
2359.200,2361.500," yeah whatever when I see you've been"
2362.900,2366.500," tasting while sitting I mean there's absolutely no reason not to"
2367.700,2369.700," just carry it carry on with it"
2370.300,2372.000," as you go and put the cattle on"
2372.300,2372.700," pretty cool"
2373.900,2374.600," or as you just"
2375.400,2378.200," stretch and sit here for a while and then whatever you need to do"
2380.000,2382.200," just let the meditative awareness"
2384.300,2386.300," I don't just stay in it you know"
2387.700,2390.600," okay so we'll see we'll reconvene in"
2391.400,2391.800," five minutes"
2393.000,2393.700," thank you all very much"
2482.300,2482.300,"you"
2516.200,2516.400,"to"
2536.800,2537.000," my"
2612.100,2612.600,"so good"
2634.600,2635.800," everybody's coming back"
2637.000,2639.500," actually not everybody quite is back but"
2640.600,2642.700," we'll just get gently into the flow"
2643.500,2643.800," um"
2644.400,2646.300," I'm just just looking again at the"
2648.300,2648.700," lovely"
2649.200,2653.700," Grid The Gallery so great to see everybody god thank you all for being here"
2654.800,2655.300," um"
2655.700,2658.400," I put I think you know of course I can see a lot of um"
2659.000,2661.100," old hands over the original love program"
2661.600,2663.700," and maybe some new people as well so"
2664.400,2667.300," I think actually either way is good to"
2669.300,2672.000," to go just to spend a moment sort of"
2673.100,2673.800," re"
2675.900,2677.600," or visiting for the first time for some of you"
2678.200,2679.400," that the whole point of this"
2680.100,2680.700," approach"
2681.600,2684.900," which is kind of a little bit of a"
2685.700,2686.100," re"
2687.000,2688.000," jigging of"
2690.100,2694.400," the training's that I've been through of course the main one of those"
2695.100,2695.900," being Zen"
2696.700,2698.100," so I sort of"
2698.500,2702.000," I've also trained in in Janna practice which is a"
2702.400,2703.900," deep terabyte methodology"
2704.500,2706.100," and in various kind of mindfulness"
2707.400,2713.600," of course that's you know that's that's the main thing these days but I've but this original love program is an attempt to"
2715.800,2717.500," have no slightly different"
2719.300,2720.400," approach really to"
2721.900,2722.400," to the hole"
2725.500,2725.800," Project"
2727.000,2727.500," of"
2727.900,2728.700," meditation"
2729.400,2730.300," and it's"
2730.600,2731.300," place"
2732.800,2735.500," in the heart of the human spiritual life"
2736.300,2737.800," and by spiritual life meaning"
2738.700,2741.000," sort of not excluding psychology"
2741.700,2742.400," and therapy"
2743.000,2744.800," and work on that level"
2745.400,2747.200," but also including"
2748.200,2749.600," these sort of"
2750.900,2752.800," these dimensions of our experience that"
2753.300,2755.900," are very hard to find the right name for"
2756.700,2759.000," their I sometimes think of them as"
2759.400,2761.200," existential in the sense that there"
2761.800,2761.900," they're"
2763.400,2767.400," insights and and even you might say kind of Revelations"
2767.900,2770.500," on the level of what are actually experienced"
2771.000,2772.800," what are actually existence is"
2773.900,2776.500," and they you know they tend to be called Spiritual"
2777.400,2779.400," but that doesn't mean that to do with"
2780.000,2785.000," disembodied spirits that are some kind of being that's not a material because there's nothing like that"
2785.600,2785.700," it's"
2786.300,2788.800," we use the word spiritual because we don't have a we don't have a"
2789.300,2790.000," clearer one"
2792.300,2793.900," I suppose you might say that Buddhism"
2795.200,2797.000," was by the way as a Western word"
2797.400,2799.700," there was there was no such thing as Buddhism until"
2800.600,2802.400," about 1840 when"
2803.000,2803.800," some western"
2804.800,2809.500," ethnographers you could call them or you know explorers and and students of"
2809.900,2810.600," Eastern"
2811.000,2812.800," practices realise that there was a"
2813.400,2814.200," a body of"
2815.400,2817.100," there was a kind of network and body of"
2817.500,2819.900," a certain kinds of practice that we're all related to this"
2820.700,2824.600," this guy called shaquem money or soccer or Sakura Shakir"
2825.200,2825.400," meaning"
2825.900,2826.900," checking money Buddha"
2827.400,2831.500," and gradually sort of they they realise oh yeah there's this whole"
2832.600,2833.900," set of practice is and"
2834.800,2835.500," that fall under"
2838.300,2842.600," Buddhism we can so that word was coin I think it was basically by"
2845.100,2846.700," I don't want to get"
2847.300,2849.200," the same thing too definitive it's not my"
2849.900,2850.100," field"
2850.500,2853.200," really the history of Buddhism but there was a French"
2855.000,2855.400," Scholar"
2857.000,2859.600," who published a great book called someone over history and practices of"
2860.100,2860.700," Buddhism"
2861.500,2862.600," in the 1840s"
2863.300,2863.400," but"
2864.100,2864.700," the word"
2865.100,2866.800," Buddhism of course comes from the word"
2867.100,2867.500," Buddha"
2867.900,2869.000," which comes from the root"
2869.300,2870.600," bud or bored"
2870.900,2871.600," by odh"
2872.400,2872.900," which means"
2874.100,2875.300," to do things to do with"
2875.700,2876.300," waking up"
2876.800,2878.000," basically Awakening"
2878.700,2881.600," waking up can be in the perfectly ordinary sense of waking up"
2883.900,2884.800," in the case of"
2885.500,2887.800," this kind of practice is to do with"
2891.300,2894.000," breaking open into a different"
2894.800,2896.900," dimension of perspective"
2897.300,2898.000," on our"
2899.100,2900.400," ordinary experience"
2901.100,2903.700," that one key part of that is"
2904.300,2905.000," different perspective"
2905.800,2907.800," on what our sensors self"
2908.500,2909.900," has been normally"
2910.800,2914.600," we're so kind of wrapped up in our sense of self"
2915.200,2917.200," so I- identified with"
2918.600,2918.900," the"
2919.700,2921.000," cognitive pieces"
2922.600,2924.700," that we can consider to be proof of"
2925.100,2925.800," our self"
2926.400,2928.000," as an existing entity"
2928.900,2932.100," that we we can't get any perspective on it"
2932.700,2934.000," we're just caught up in it"
2934.600,2934.700," it and"
2935.400,2938.800," the one of the key senses of this kind of"
2940.600,2942.500,"good or waking up"
2942.800,2944.700," is to have some perspective"
2945.200,2946.300," on that sense of self"
2946.900,2948.600," the meaning that a perspective"
2949.500,2950.200," in which we're not"
2950.800,2952.000," already wrapped up in it"
2952.400,2953.700," so we can sort of see it"
2953.900,2954.900," as a phenomenon"
2955.500,2956.300," from a perspective"
2957.000,2958.500," that is free of that"
2959.100,2959.600," phenomenon"
2960.000,2960.900," if you see what I'm in"
2961.300,2962.300," so we can find the"
2963.000,2963.400," our"
2964.200,2964.400," our"
2965.300,2965.800," being kind of"
2966.200,2969.000," buried in this little nugget called me"
2970.900,2971.300," suddenly"
2972.300,2973.500," we're free to that"
2974.400,2974.600," and"
2975.200,2975.400," we"
2976.500,2976.800," then"
2977.500,2977.900," are"
2978.600,2979.800," drop back into"
2980.600,2981.900," a much wider picture"
2982.500,2986.900," and it can it could that wider pitch it can have different flavours different dimensions different"
2987.500,2988.400," aspects to it"
2988.900,2989.800," but in all of them"
2991.000,2994.300," we just know that we're we're we're we're we're getting a larger"
2995.000,2996.800," and actually more real view"
2997.600,2998.600," than the view we had"
2999.100,2999.600," when we're kind of"
3000.400,3003.000," you know Tangled Up in this little nugget called me"
3005.700,3009.000," so that's the kind of waiting up and and it's a beautiful thing"
3009.500,3012.300," and it is well a tested humans can go through"
3013.100,3016.700," it and in zen is often called seeing"
3017.000,3019.900," original nature or sometimes original face"
3020.600,3026.900," and I'm still by the way just around about way talking about the origin of this particular program called the original love"
3027.300,3028.200," and I want to tell you"
3028.800,3031.200," a little story from the Zen animals that"
3032.300,3033.000," help make"
3033.600,3035.800," I think will help make clear what we're talking about"
3036.200,3037.000," in this program"
3037.500,3038.600," and what this program"
3039.200,3041.000," is seeking to offer and help"
3041.400,3042.400," all of us with"
3043.000,3044.500," which in just tell you now is a"
3044.900,3045.500," fine"
3046.500,3048.700," welcoming gentle generous"
3049.400,3050.300," heartfelt"
3050.800,3052.900," nor an excluding approach"
3053.400,3055.100," to Meditation whereby"
3055.400,3056.500," that are not"
3057.100,3058.100," obstacles you got to get over"
3058.600,3059.600," hurdles you have to leave"
3060.300,3061.500," breakthroughs you have to have"
3061.900,3062.500," returned sort of"
3062.800,3063.100," basically"
3063.600,3065.400," approach meditation with none of the above"
3066.200,3066.200," so"
3067.300,3068.100," here's the little story"
3068.700,3069.300," he'll again"
3069.600,3071.000," was a ninth century"
3072.200,3072.500," Young"
3073.700,3075.200," Buddhists in China"
3075.800,3076.400," who was very"
3077.200,3077.600," bright"
3078.000,3080.000," apparently young man and he was a"
3080.300,3081.300," ego skal"
3082.000,3082.600," and he"
3083.600,3086.400," he had mastered the you know the scholarship of various"
3087.100,3087.900," topix and"
3088.400,3089.600," scriptures and things and"
3090.200,3092.100," designers to go and visit a great master"
3093.200,3093.600," and sort of"
3094.000,3096.300," hit himself against this master and"
3097.000,3099.400," a master was a guy called great shun"
3099.600,3102.600," or Eastern in the China in the Japanese pronunciation"
3103.300,3103.400," so"
3103.900,3104.700," kill gangers to"
3106.300,3106.600," and"
3107.800,3110.800," and starts to kind of present his understanding and"
3111.600,3112.400," and Grace and"
3113.200,3114.200," listens and then"
3115.600,3115.800," when"
3116.400,3117.800," you're going to sort of winds down"
3120.200,3121.300," and simply says"
3122.100,3122.900," it's very simple"
3123.900,3125.400," you just have to find your"
3126.400,3127.300," original face"
3128.500,3129.100," that you've had"
3129.700,3130.300," since before"
3130.900,3131.800," even your parents"
3132.600,3133.200," were born"
3136.100,3137.500," you just said to find"
3137.800,3138.300," or c"
3139.000,3140.200," your original face"
3140.900,3141.900," which you had"
3142.800,3144.800," since before even your parents"
3145.300,3145.700," were born"
3146.900,3148.400," the original face you've had since"
3148.900,3150.400," certainly before you were born"
3151.800,3155.400," the your own original face from before you were born"
3156.100,3156.500," in fact"
3156.900,3157.000," before"
3157.600,3157.900," even"
3158.700,3159.900," your parents were born"
3161.700,3162.200," okay so"
3163.200,3163.700," that's what"
3164.600,3165.900," we share and said to kill"
3166.900,3167.500," again"
3168.000,3169.500," having travelled far with all his"
3170.200,3172.100," little sort of a they had this little wooden"
3173.300,3174.700," sort of like a wooden backpack"
3175.100,3178.400," basically sort of wooden crate that they were on their back it brought that"
3178.900,3180.000," we've always scrolls in it"
3180.700,3181.900," and the story is that he sort of"
3182.800,3184.200," is that he sort of thought no problem"
3184.800,3185.300," and when"
3185.900,3186.200," to is"
3186.800,3190.400," wherever he was you know whether he had a little cell or a bunk or something"
3191.000,3191.800," in the Monastery"
3192.500,3195.100," you've got out all this scriptures does looking through them all for"
3195.400,3196.200," original face"
3197.100,3199.300," finally something on the original face that he can bring"
3200.100,3201.400," to the great master say I got it"
3201.800,3203.600," this is this is what there is no faces"
3204.500,3206.200," and he's so he's up and gradually"
3206.700,3208.600," realising he's not he can't find anything and"
3209.100,3212.500," apparently he's up all night getting more and more desperate trying to find something"
3213.000,3213.100," and"
3214.300,3216.400," nothing and then in the morning he goes"
3217.300,3217.800," back to"
3219.500,3221.000," gracious and having me an up all night"
3222.300,3222.900," master"
3223.600,3228.500," I I don't know I have I can't find anything on the original face what does it mean"
3229.900,3231.300," and the question says in"
3231.800,3232.800," I could tell you"
3233.700,3235.700," but you wouldn't thank me for it"
3236.000,3236.400," later"
3239.700,3239.700," so"
3241.100,3246.100," this is a important moment in gilgo life and suddenly he's actually"
3248.800,3250.200," he realises that"
3251.100,3254.400," all is scholarship and his in his parents sort of brilliance"
3255.400,3255.700," it's just"
3256.100,3257.200," it's not going to help him"
3258.200,3258.900," he's reached and"
3259.400,3260.000," pass"
3260.400,3263.300," as the French say a place you cannot go beyond"
3263.900,3265.400," with your current understanding"
3265.700,3267.100," I love this actually it's like I'm"
3267.900,3269.800," pleasure you know the Child Development"
3270.400,3273.000," great Swiss child development psychologist from the"
3273.400,3276.100," mid early mid what was it mid 20th century"
3276.600,3277.200," piaget"
3277.700,3277.900," he"
3279.400,3280.000," he said"
3281.200,3283.300," I'm sure there's an some"
3284.000,3287.500," deep psychologists here so forgive me if I don't understand exactly right"
3288.100,3290.600," but I believe ya as we said something like"
3291.000,3292.500," there's two kinds of learning"
3292.900,3294.000," that a child goes through"
3294.300,3295.700," I suppose all of us go through"
3296.000,3296.700," one is"
3297.100,3298.900," a simulation and the other is"
3299.200,3300.200," accommodation"
3300.500,3302.000," and a simulation means"
3303.300,3306.400," the we have a certain frame of understanding"
3306.800,3309.100," and we can assimilate new material into it"
3309.600,3310.300," find something new"
3310.700,3311.800," if it fits there"
3312.400,3313.500," something new if it's there"
3314.300,3317.000," then there's something else called accommodation which is when"
3317.600,3318.900," new information comes in"
3319.600,3321.200," that the existing frame"
3321.700,3322.800," simply can't hold"
3324.300,3324.700," and then"
3325.500,3325.700," the"
3327.000,3327.300," brain"
3328.500,3330.000," I suppose we either just"
3330.600,3333.400," decide we're going to close down and not know about that thing"
3334.000,3335.900," which probably happens quite a lot actually for us"
3337.000,3337.300," or"
3338.200,3339.300," it's going to have to break"
3340.600,3342.500," to allow to accommodate"
3343.400,3344.000," the new"
3344.400,3344.800," information"
3345.800,3348.500," and somehow kogan recognises"
3349.200,3350.200," that he's just reached"
3350.900,3352.700," one of those accommodation points"
3353.400,3355.200," but he does not know how to accommodate"
3356.400,3356.900," the new"
3358.600,3360.100," whatever it is that's being"
3362.700,3363.400," pressed upon it"
3364.000,3364.700," so he"
3365.500,3368.400," loses confidence in his existing way"
3369.000,3369.800," of understanding"
3370.500,3371.200," but doesn't yet"
3372.400,3374.200," have the new way of understanding"
3376.000,3377.300," so what does he do he he"
3378.400,3380.000," sort of renounces all his"
3380.400,3381.000," scholarship"
3381.400,3382.900," it's a bit of a dramatic story it's just"
3383.500,3384.500," more dramatic than I realised"
3384.900,3388.700," he he renounces all that and goes and becomes an itinerant labourer"
3389.100,3391.000," he just drifts from place to place"
3392.000,3396.000," having a little you know odd job or jobs he"
3396.800,3401.900," you know after a while I mean late years some years he wins up"
3402.600,3405.000," as a kind of janitor or groundsman"
3405.700,3408.000," for a little shrine with a little temple"
3409.800,3411.100," it actually happens to be"
3411.900,3412.800," a shrine"
3413.500,3414.100," to"
3414.800,3415.000," the"
3415.600,3416.500," kind of put six"
3416.900,3418.300," and sister of Buddhism"
3418.900,3420.600," in China called way noon"
3421.200,3422.100," and Wayne noon"
3422.500,3424.000," it just so happens"
3424.600,3425.200," was the first"
3425.700,3427.700," person in least in zen records"
3428.100,3429.100," that asked this question"
3429.600,3431.000," what is your original face"
3431.500,3432.900," from before your parents were born"
3433.800,3435.600," so it's just an old little nice little"
3436.000,3436.900," coincidence that"
3437.400,3438.200," some you know"
3438.800,3441.600," kind of development of the narrative was woven into the story"
3442.300,3444.700," anyway he's now working as a janitor"
3446.300,3448.300," or you grounds keeper you know there's little"
3448.900,3449.800," little little shrine"
3451.600,3452.500," sweeping every morning"
3453.400,3454.200," polishing things"
3455.000,3455.600," dusting"
3456.400,3456.500," you know"
3457.500,3458.800," whatever his chores were"
3459.900,3460.700," day by day"
3462.600,3465.900," I presumably maybe he's still doing a sitting but he's no longer"
3466.900,3469.200," meeting with teachers is no longer"
3470.100,3470.700," studying"
3471.200,3473.300," text with the Indian way he used to"
3474.200,3474.700," one morning"
3475.600,3477.200," he's sweeping out the yard"
3478.000,3479.800," and his broom catches a little"
3480.400,3482.200," piece of a little pebble"
3483.100,3485.600," or some say it was a little piece of a broken tile"
3486.300,3487.500," and and it flicks"
3488.400,3492.100," you know this this brum is sweeping sweeping and then it's little flick"
3492.800,3493.500," the Pebble"
3494.100,3495.200," lies up and hits"
3496.300,3501.600," one of those giant stalks of bamboo you know that could be sort of 670 feet tall"
3502.300,3502.500," and it"
3502.900,3504.200," hits with it knock"
3504.600,3505.100," a halo"
3505.800,3506.200," talk"
3506.700,3507.800," this little pebble"
3508.200,3509.200," or piece of tile"
3509.600,3510.700," flik cock"
3510.800,3512.000," it's the bamboo Tuck"
3512.200,3513.200," and it's a it's sort of"
3514.000,3514.400," somehow"
3516.100,3518.800," you know presumably using gross in his task of sweeping"
3519.500,3520.200," maybe he's in"
3521.100,3522.100," quite a settled"
3522.600,3524.300," sort of meditating kind of state"
3525.000,3528.200," and then there's suddenly there's this unexpected sound fuck"
3528.600,3528.600," and"
3529.400,3530.300," that instant"
3532.500,3533.400," yoghurt and"
3534.800,3535.400," here's that"
3535.800,3536.100," top"
3538.000,3540.800," in a way his never heard any sound before"
3543.000,3543.300," suddenly"
3544.200,3545.400," there is only"
3547.100,3547.800," that sound"
3550.400,3553.800," there's there's no engineering this there's no manufacturing it"
3554.700,3555.800," there's no making it"
3556.600,3558.000," is some"
3559.000,3559.800," Preparatory"
3561.600,3561.700," so"
3563.000,3564.700," work or whatever we can do"
3565.500,3566.700," which is our practice"
3567.800,3567.900," and"
3568.400,3569.000," if we're"
3569.700,3570.400," doing practice"
3572.200,3572.500," sometimes"
3573.400,3574.100," out of the blue"
3575.700,3576.200," somehow"
3577.700,3581.200," we're in some kind of open state or who knows what"
3581.500,3582.000," where suddenly"
3582.900,3584.800," something like this can happen there's just a"
3585.300,3585.600," little"
3586.200,3586.800," experience"
3588.000,3588.600," but in that"
3589.400,3590.900," instant of experience"
3591.500,3594.900," we discover something about the very nature of experience"
3595.400,3595.900," itself"
3596.300,3598.000," that applies to all experienced"
3598.600,3600.100," and our whole frame"
3600.800,3603.300," of how we've been understanding experience"
3604.100,3604.900," up until then"
3606.400,3606.900," chatters"
3607.300,3608.000," and Falls"
3608.600,3611.700," and that that's what happened to that moment he said"
3612.400,3613.900," afterwards he was kind of"
3614.400,3615.400," story as that he was sort of"
3615.800,3617.000," there's something just happened and"
3617.700,3618.900," this not just sort of"
3620.100,3622.200," you know he would he was completely blown away"
3622.700,3623.700," and what he knew"
3625.100,3625.700," of himself"
3626.600,3627.900," and of his understanding and life"
3628.300,3628.400," was"
3629.000,3630.700," blown away that little notch"
3631.100,3632.000," and it all just"
3633.100,3634.000," disappeared"
3634.400,3636.000," there was nothing but that not"
3637.000,3637.400," anyway"
3638.000,3642.800," and he said it afterwards you know he was he was trembling and sweating and weeping and"
3643.500,3646.900," and he changed his clothes he changed his two of his clothes and washed and"
3647.300,3648.400," put on new clothes"
3649.000,3650.600," and lit incense"
3651.200,3653.200," and then bowed in the direction of old"
3653.700,3654.200," wish"
3655.900,3656.600," and and said"
3657.400,3658.500," thank you so much"
3659.600,3661.600," for not answering my question"
3662.400,3665.400," it was you were kind of in my own parents"
3666.000,3667.600," in not telling me the answer"
3668.100,3668.700," back then"
3669.600,3671.700," because now he's actually discovered from himself"
3672.400,3673.600," his own original face"
3675.400,3676.400," and he writes of verse"
3677.000,3679.200," the first line of which is one notch"
3679.800,3680.900," and I have forgotten"
3681.600,3682.800," everything I ever"
3683.700,3683.900," knew"
3689.200,3689.400," so"
3690.400,3691.200," this is"
3691.900,3692.900," a real possibility"
3693.700,3694.400," for us humans"
3695.300,3695.400," to"
3696.500,3699.500," to to have our existing frame"
3700.000,3700.800," of experiencing"
3702.000,3704.700," you know which by and large is based on the sense that"
3705.400,3706.000," I am"
3706.800,3708.800," somewhere inside the skin bag"
3710.600,3713.200," and the whole world is outside the skin bag"
3713.500,3714.700," actually that's not quite enough"
3715.400,3716.900," I am some little nugget"
3717.400,3718.300," within this body"
3719.200,3719.500," and"
3720.400,3722.000," whatever kind of nugget I am"
3722.700,3724.500," all of my experience"
3724.800,3726.100," is just outside"
3727.100,3730.000," it so that includes body experience so if I feel my foot"
3730.800,3732.600," I am the subject"
3733.200,3734.200," that is experiencing"
3734.800,3736.000," an object called"
3736.500,3739.300," that happens to be my foot or if I have a stomach a"
3739.900,3742.000," I am the subject experiencing"
3742.500,3742.800," in"
3743.200,3744.500," the difficult feeling"
3745.100,3745.700," in the belly"
3746.200,3748.700," so that so as just as much as I might be hearing"
3749.200,3750.100," the sound of a car"
3750.700,3752.200," I am this recipient"
3752.800,3753.700," of all experience"
3754.600,3754.900," so"
3755.600,3757.600," that's one setup that's one"
3758.300,3760.200," arrangement of our understanding of experience"
3761.900,3764.800," in the experience of seeing the original face"
3765.400,3766.000," put on quote"
3766.800,3767.700," that kyogen just had"
3769.300,3769.600," that"
3770.300,3770.900," collapsed"
3771.400,3773.600," there was no separation between"
3774.500,3775.200," the sound"
3776.100,3777.200," and the person experiencing"
3778.100,3778.400," it"
3779.300,3780.100," that was just"
3780.900,3781.300," the sound"
3785.900,3786.100," okay"
3788.500,3789.000," so then"
3789.700,3792.300," values that kind of Awakening"
3792.600,3794.100," sudden Awakening"
3796.000,3796.600," on the whole"
3797.100,3797.700," is probably"
3798.200,3799.500," very much in line with"
3800.300,3801.400," the kind of a Awakening"
3802.100,3803.200," described in"
3803.800,3804.700," early Buddhist"
3805.200,3805.800," texts"
3806.300,3808.200," paravada texts that partly Canon"
3808.800,3808.900," but"
3809.500,3814.300," in the early stuff it tends to usually be a bit more gradual there's a sort of"
3814.900,3816.500," gradual progression and of"
3817.300,3818.800," insight of"
3820.400,3822.000," loosening of attachments"
3823.000,3823.500," and you kind of"
3823.900,3825.500," you may get to somewhere really"
3826.000,3826.700," pretty much the same"
3827.600,3830.300," but by a more kind of step by step approach"
3834.600,3834.900," and"
3836.600,3840.200," things in let me just let me just just let's just take a moment actually just"
3840.900,3841.500," absorb"
3842.200,3843.900," or be with just check where we are"
3845.000,3846.000," with a story of"
3847.600,3848.000," kyogre"
3850.100,3850.900," and the story of"
3852.000,3853.100," seeing the original"
3854.400,3854.700," face"
3857.300,3859.700," and you know it may be a little shocking even this sort of"
3860.100,3861.300," possibility of"
3861.800,3864.100," my man there's a really different way to experience things"
3865.800,3866.600," that's just"
3868.200,3870.900," I don't want to rush ahead too fast that's just"
3873.000,3874.700," ah just see how we're doing"
3896.900,3897.800," yeah okay so"
3898.600,3898.800," kind of"
3899.500,3900.400," all of that one"
3901.800,3906.200," kind of approach to practice whether it's actually in this is any way or whether it's in the more"
3906.900,3908.800," the earlier Buddhist terror kind of way"
3909.500,3909.900," that there's a"
3910.800,3913.200," there's a there's a acknowledged sort of goal"
3914.500,3915.500," or possibility"
3916.500,3919.500," and approaches might differ about how you get there"
3920.400,3922.400," but there's a there's kind of you know there's a"
3924.300,3925.100," there's a part"
3926.200,3927.500," there's a known path"
3928.400,3928.900," that has"
3929.900,3931.500," either certain known"
3932.600,3934.000," landmarks along the way"
3934.500,3935.700," plus a destination"
3936.600,3941.500," or it may be a little vager about the landmarks but still fairly clear about the destination"
3943.300,3943.400," okay"
3945.900,3946.900," well that's beautiful"
3947.800,3949.400," it's lovely that such a thing"
3950.000,3951.400," such things exist that"
3952.000,3953.800," know about and care about"
3954.300,3956.100," and value and want to share"
3957.100,3958.700," these human possibilities"
3959.400,3959.600," that"
3960.800,3962.300," we have actually not had such"
3963.200,3963.900," easy access to"
3964.900,3965.500," we I mean"
3965.800,3968.500," and mean in in the west over the millennia"
3969.500,3972.200," there really hasn't been such clear understanding"
3973.600,3974.100," past down"
3974.900,3976.100," but the last two and a half millennia"
3976.600,3977.400," the way there has"
3978.200,3979.000," in a Asia"
3980.000,3982.800," largely but by no means it schools will be through Buddhism"
3983.800,3985.700," other Asian practices that ride on it as well"
3986.700,3989.300," but maybe there's a little bit of a different thing with Buddhism"
3990.100,3993.100," that it had absolutely no preconceptions about"
3994.000,3996.900," a worldview they didn't really I mean Buddha didn't"
3997.600,3998.500," set out to say"
3999.300,4002.300," there's a god there's a soul and we're going to discover them"
4002.900,4004.300," he didn't do that he said"
4005.000,4007.200," I just want to understand human experience"
4008.000,4010.100," now I also want to understand why they're suffer"
4010.600,4012.600," my suffering is so endemic to humans"
4013.400,4014.500," that's all I want to understand"
4015.100,4017.900," and managed to come up with a system that doesn't need to"
4018.500,4021.200," have any kind of super nature in it at all"
4022.000,4023.500," it you know some"
4024.200,4024.400," might"
4024.900,4028.700," want to massive as well and definitely there are fours and Buddhism that are very"
4029.100,4030.400," like other religions but"
4030.800,4034.600," that is core I think it's fair to say that the contemplative path of Buddhism"
4035.200,4036.600," the study of the human experience"
4037.400,4037.600," doesn't"
4038.000,4039.200," need to have those things"
4040.400,4041.800," in it is really just"
4044.200,4044.900," studying"
4046.800,4047.900," finding out you know"
4048.100,4048.900," what it is to"
4049.900,4051.300," be experiencing"
4052.300,4052.800," at all"
4056.000,4056.200," okay"
4056.700,4056.800," so"
4058.000,4058.500," all that"
4058.900,4059.700," lovely great"
4060.200,4060.300," but"
4061.900,4062.800," it's not the only way"
4067.000,4067.600," what I found"
4068.800,4070.700," and forgive me those of you hoping this"
4071.300,4072.600," little story before what I've"
4074.000,4075.900," having done fabulous training"
4076.500,4076.700," in"
4077.600,4078.600," you know in in Buddhism"
4080.300,4084.600," and in you know more Hindu based meditation"
4085.500,4086.100," I found"
4087.500,4087.800," one"
4088.700,4092.500," time when I was staying for six weeks a little seaside"
4093.300,4096.500," village in Venezuela at the end of a writing assignment that was a"
4097.200,4101.400," I was a lucky young man I got I started my writing life really early"
4101.900,4102.400," and I had"
4103.500,4104.700," I had this this this"
4105.200,4106.900," sort of privileged really of being"
4107.500,4111.600," sent I mean having done two or three books as being sent around by"
4112.100,4113.300," magazines or writing"
4113.800,4114.400," assignments"
4115.100,4116.700," often in Latin America and in"
4118.000,4119.000," and in the Caribbean"
4119.600,4119.600," and"
4120.500,4122.700," you know I think I also had a"
4123.100,4125.800," little bit of a life as a musician in the Caribbean as well but"
4126.300,4128.400," anyway as a result of all about I was doing a"
4128.900,4130.200," story in Venezuela"
4131.200,4132.500," and at the end of it I"
4133.200,4135.800," had done the research and I was written it and I said you know I had"
4136.500,4139.600," six weeks when I just wanted to sit and write on a book I was working on"
4140.500,4142.600," and I was staying in this little village and"
4144.400,4147.100," it is beautiful little place and seaside"
4148.200,4150.400," you know tropical beach palm trees"
4150.900,4154.800," very simple little place Cup I think only one hotel actually and then"
4155.500,4156.600," another"
4157.400,4158.700," house that you can rent rooms in"
4159.800,4160.200," and I was"
4161.200,4163.300," probably two or three hundred people or something"
4164.000,4164.200," and"
4165.400,4166.800," fishermen and you know boats"
4167.200,4167.700," pulled up and"
4168.800,4172.000," tied to palm trees you have to be careful actually walking around at night"
4172.500,4173.900," these and trip over the ropes"
4174.500,4175.900," that were holding the boats up"
4176.400,4177.300," but I'm not"
4178.100,4180.500," I started sitting out on the beach every evening"
4181.200,4183.100," because there's such beautiful quiet spot"
4183.700,4184.000," just"
4184.500,4186.600," make myself a little mound of sand and sit"
4187.400,4187.500," and"
4188.200,4190.700," maybe on the third night I was sitting like that and"
4191.300,4193.300," and then I heard little voice in your senior"
4193.700,4195.400," and I looked up and two boys with that"
4196.000,4196.900," they asked me what I was doing"
4197.900,4198.800," and I said I'm meditating"
4199.600,4200.800," there's a well what's that"
4201.800,4205.800," and and I said traffic to explain them well can we do it too"
4206.300,4206.800," so I"
4207.500,4211.200," I will okay so I sort of got them"
4211.900,4214.700," set up with little Mounds of sand and to sit on and"
4215.400,4219.000," and I explained I explained about counting the breath and"
4219.100,4219.900," sitting up right"
4220.900,4225.200," it did five minutes and at the end of five minutes I said okay that's great you've done great that's five minutes"
4225.700,4226.200," let's do more"
4226.700,4227.800," so we did another five minutes"
4228.600,4228.900," and then"
4229.900,4231.400," basically they came"
4232.100,4236.300," they just kept showing up to join me so I would bring in friends and occasionally a parent or two and"
4237.500,4241.200," it just became a regular little thing a sitting out there in the evening"
4241.600,4242.500," little group of Us"
4243.200,4243.300," and"
4244.300,4247.800," I mean I'm there was one one evening I didn't show up and the next morning"
4248.800,4252.200," the two boys are at my door and a hotel say what where were you lost"
4252.800,4253.400," now so that's"
4253.800,4255.000," okay I've got to keep doing this"
4255.600,4255.700," and"
4257.000,4260.100," but the point was when we were just sitting there like"
4261.500,4261.900," that there was"
4263.900,4265.100," there was there was there was a"
4265.800,4266.200," something that I"
4266.700,4267.400," I kind of hadn't"
4267.900,4268.600," tasted before"
4269.400,4270.300," in the various"
4271.300,4277.200," context in which I had previously meditate to know that point I'd be meditating about 10 years"
4277.800,4279.300," I've been to a couple of monasteries"
4280.100,4281.100," several times and that"
4281.600,4281.600," you know"
4282.100,4282.700," whatever you"
4283.100,4283.900," pretty diligent"
4284.900,4286.200," practice in the student"
4288.200,4290.000," but when we were just sitting like that"
4290.500,4291.700," in the warm air"
4292.700,4296.300," with the sometimes the little shifting of the Wind In The Palm front"
4297.500,4298.600," and the gentle lapping"
4299.600,4301.000," of the sea nearby"
4302.100,4303.000," the warm air"
4303.800,4305.000," and the are doing that"
4305.700,4308.200," thing had becoming kind of powdered it dust"
4309.300,4310.700," for piskula it's a"
4311.200,4311.300," you know"
4312.200,4314.600," particulate if you know what I mean yeah I guess getting"
4315.600,4315.800," getting"
4317.200,4320.200," yeah that sort of particular quality and dust"
4320.700,4321.600," we're just sitting there"
4322.500,4323.000," it was really"
4324.500,4326.400," it was so much sweeter"
4327.600,4328.600," so not feel"
4329.500,4334.100," that we were trying to lose my experience that we were I was trying to do anything"
4336.100,4337.200," it was much more"
4338.200,4338.500," like"
4340.100,4341.100," trying to do nothing"
4342.400,4344.600," or not even trying to do"
4345.600,4346.500," anything at all"
4347.700,4348.700," but simply"
4349.900,4350.300," being"
4352.900,4354.300," and simply letting"
4356.600,4356.900," um"
4359.000,4359.600," letting"
4360.700,4362.200," my sense of being"
4363.800,4365.400," do whatever it needed to"
4367.700,4369.300," do which generally seem to be"
4371.000,4373.400," not necessarily that it needed to but kind of wanted to"
4373.900,4374.600," I sort of"
4374.900,4375.800," coming apart"
4377.500,4379.000," like a dissolving"
4381.900,4383.200," like all we're really doing"
4384.900,4385.200," when"
4386.100,4386.900," meditating"
4387.900,4388.800," is really"
4389.500,4391.300," as some actually have always said"
4391.900,4392.900," all we're really doing"
4393.800,4394.600," is letting go"
4398.300,4399.000," so yes"
4399.900,4400.200," there are"
4402.200,4405.100," there are there are very beautiful valid important"
4405.600,4407.200," meditative parts that are"
4408.600,4410.200," sort of Engineering"
4411.100,4411.600," that kind of"
4413.000,4415.100," developing generating"
4416.200,4418.800," new ways of analysing experience"
4419.500,4421.000," new ways of experiencing"
4422.500,4424.200," discovering things about our experience"
4424.700,4427.500," in strategically so sort of developed where it is"
4428.800,4429.800," but there's another way"
4430.100,4432.800," where you don't try you don't do any of"
4433.300,4433.800," that you just like"
4435.600,4436.100," you just like"
4437.200,4439.600," and what I find and I still to this day find"
4440.100,4440.700," is that then"
4441.900,4443.200," something very sweet"
4446.300,4446.400," just"
4448.600,4449.500," just comes forward"
4457.800,4459.000," it seems very natural"
4460.800,4462.000," I'm not going to make any attempt"
4462.700,4464.200," to justify this claim but"
4464.700,4466.300," it seems very natural to me"
4467.300,4469.500," but the process of really letting go"
4470.600,4471.400," of releasing"
4472.400,4473.200," of letting go"
4474.100,4474.800," takes us"
4476.000,4477.300," to some kind of"
4478.800,4479.400," sweetness"
4481.500,4482.100," and that can be"
4482.900,4484.300," even when our hearts have broken"
4485.000,4486.500," even when we're having a really hard time"
4487.600,4488.200," and we've been through"
4489.300,4491.400," their or are in the midst of very difficult"
4492.400,4495.600," scenarios in life or even our loved ones mainly"
4496.300,4497.400," very very difficult"
4498.100,4500.100," seemingly unresolvable difficult"
4502.300,4502.800," but there's a"
4503.300,4505.700," there's a way that just being"
4508.900,4511.200," Dylan quiet and trying to do nothing"
4512.700,4514.400," but being undone"
4515.300,4516.100," rather than doing"
4517.000,4520.200," a way of letting life and experience"
4520.700,4521.800," undo us"
4523.200,4526.900," it seems very natural somehow to me these days that it fan bring us"
4527.700,4529.300," to a great sweetness"
4530.100,4532.300," almost the kind of intrinsic benevolence"
4532.900,4533.400," you know some"
4534.200,4535.200," researchers talk about"
4535.900,4537.300," finding"
4537.900,4539.400," a fundamental well-being"
4540.700,4543.500," and I think that's a probably another way of expressing it"
4544.300,4547.600," what does it have to do the original face maybe quite a lot actually"
4548.600,4549.400," it could be that"
4550.000,4550.900," it is to do with"
4551.700,4553.100," doesn't have to be so dramatic"
4553.500,4554.300," buy enemies maybe"
4555.000,4555.200," maybe"
4556.400,4560.300," it could be sort of something like their original face but it can be less"
4561.800,4564.900," cataclysmic less catastrophic less vast"
4565.200,4566.900," less universal less cosmic"
4567.600,4569.300," it can just be an a- much smaller"
4570.100,4571.900," closer to home kind of level"
4572.700,4572.900," I just"
4573.800,4573.900," I'm"
4575.100,4576.700," somehow more at peace with myself"
4577.800,4578.200," somehow"
4578.600,4580.200," there's a benevolence about"
4580.800,4582.000," just being me"
4582.600,4583.200," I don't have to"
4583.900,4585.000," Pierce the Veil"
4585.400,4587.700," I don't have to see through my sense of me"
4588.100,4589.700," I can just have a kindness"
4590.300,4592.600," around my sense of being mean"
4593.600,4594.600," and that's sweet"
4596.400,4597.300," doesn't have to be"
4598.300,4598.900," this kind of"
4599.800,4601.300," got to get rid of yourself or something"
4601.800,4603.500," no you know that that's a"
4604.100,4605.700," unfortunately that's a"
4606.400,4610.300," I think it's true that our sense of self isn't exactly what we think it is"
4611.300,4611.400," but"
4612.400,4619.000," that and then it's also true that you know all the practice is that the broadly speaking non-dual"
4619.500,4620.400," meaning they"
4620.900,4623.200," seek to reveal to us that"
4623.900,4625.100," that are that are"
4626.300,4627.400," sense of being a subject"
4628.700,4632.400," with all experienced being it's object in other words duel"
4633.000,4634.400," the duality of subject"
4635.300,4635.600," me"
4636.200,4636.800," an object"
4637.500,4638.100," everything else"
4639.300,4641.100," the non-dual is to have that"
4641.900,4643.300," duality drop Away"
4644.100,4644.500," Great"
4645.300,4645.600," but"
4646.300,4647.200," it's not the only"
4648.200,4648.900," benevolence"
4650.700,4651.500," there's a sweet"
4652.400,4654.400," benevolence but practice can reveal"
4655.000,4656.000," that is not so"
4656.600,4658.100," exalted or dramatic"
4658.700,4660.000," but every bit of sweet"
4661.700,4662.500," so actually I'm going to just"
4663.100,4663.600," all right"
4666.000,4667.900," okay I'm just gonna I want to read you a poem"
4669.200,4669.500," okay"
4671.200,4673.300," so this little poem"
4673.700,4675.400," is called sweeping the yard"
4678.000,4680.000," and it's kind of like okay"
4681.200,4683.000," well maybe I don't need to say anything about it"
4683.900,4685.500," let me just have a quick chat"
4688.600,4690.400," yeah okay"
4690.900,4692.500," okay well we'll get we'll get to the chat later"
4693.700,4695.100," okay so let me see"
4695.400,4697.800," I think I can probably do it without looking but I'm not sure"
4699.400,4700.600," sweeping the yard"
4703.100,4705.800," no I can't do it I've got it here"
4706.400,4707.400," let's see how far I can get"
4708.000,4709.700," when I sweep the yard"
4710.200,4710.800," in the morning"
4711.700,4712.800," I don't do it"
4713.700,4714.400," for myself"
4715.000,4716.400," because I like it Tight"
4717.800,4718.800," I don't even do it"
4719.300,4720.200," with a yards"
4720.700,4720.800," say"
4721.600,4723.100," because it enjoys being"
4723.800,4724.100," clean"
4725.800,4726.400," I do it"
4727.200,4728.500," for the shy one"
4729.900,4731.400," I do it for the shy one"
4731.800,4733.200," who lives inside me"
4734.600,4736.100," who loves the world better"
4736.900,4738.000," than I ever will"
4739.200,4740.100," who's innocence"
4740.400,4741.000," is beyond"
4741.600,4742.200," understanding"
4743.200,4744.400," and who sweetness"
4745.200,4746.400," shines on the Earth"
4747.000,4749.100," so the Earth loves itself"
4749.700,4750.200," again"
4751.800,4754.400," who I only ever know in glimpses"
4755.800,4756.900," that leave me breathless"
4757.800,4758.600," with longing"
4759.300,4764.500," I do it when I'm sweeping the yard and doing it for the shy one who lives inside me"
4765.700,4765.900," whose"
4766.600,4768.000," who loves the world better"
4768.500,4770.300," and I ever will who's innocence"
4770.800,4771.800," is beyond understanding"
4772.500,4774.800," and who sweetness shines on the Earth"
4775.600,4777.600," so the Earth loves itself"
4778.000,4778.500," again"
4779.800,4781.300," and who I only never"
4781.800,4783.400," who I only ever know"
4783.800,4784.800," in glimpses"
4785.900,4788.200," that leave me breathless with longing"
4789.000,4791.600," with hope that goodness is still possible"
4792.100,4793.800," it's still somehow present"
4794.200,4794.700," in the world"
4796.900,4798.500," glimpses that knock away"
4799.600,4801.200," all my ideas that who"
4801.900,4802.400," or what"
4803.000,4803.500," I should be"
4805.900,4806.200," So"
4807.300,4808.900," we pick up the Brim again"
4809.600,4810.200," here and I"
4810.900,4812.600," and send the old leaves"
4813.200,4814.800," skittering across the patio"
4816.200,4817.000," and the dust"
4817.600,4819.100," smoking over the tile"
4819.900,4821.300," like ink from a brush"
4822.500,4823.200," as we make"
4823.900,4825.000," the little piles"
4825.600,4826.800," we'll gather in"
4827.700,4828.000," later"
4830.100,4830.400," this"
4830.900,4831.400," is how"
4831.900,4832.500," he wakes up"
4833.800,4834.400," this is how"
4835.300,4836.200," his wakefulness"
4837.200,4837.900," turns"
4838.300,4839.500," our little yard"
4840.300,4841.300," into the Bright"
4841.700,4842.000," base"
4843.000,4843.900," I call home"
4847.900,4850.300," so we pick up the Broom together again"
4850.900,4851.400," here and"
4852.600,4856.000," I we send the LEDs skittering across the patio"
4856.800,4859.300," and the dust smoking over the tiles"
4859.600,4860.800," like in from a brush"
4861.600,4862.300," as we make"
4862.700,4863.900," the little piles"
4864.200,4865.100," we'll gather in"
4865.900,4866.200," later"
4866.800,4867.100," this"
4867.500,4868.600," is how he waits up"
4869.700,4870.000," this"
4870.500,4871.900," is how his wakefulness"
4873.100,4873.600," turns"
4874.900,4876.300," our little yard"
4877.100,4877.400," into"
4878.300,4879.100," the bright face"
4879.600,4880.600," I call home"
4892.800,4893.700," we've been here"
4894.300,4894.600," okay"
4895.800,4896.200," so you see"
4898.300,4898.800," not as"
4899.900,4903.000," I'm afraid nowhere near as dramatic as kogan"
4904.000,4906.500," no great revelations there in that"
4907.100,4908.000," but sweetness"
4911.600,4913.800," contacting just contacting something"
4918.400,4919.500," I'm happy to contact"
4929.100,4929.300," now"
4930.300,4932.200," let me just see what I've got left"
4932.900,4935.400," to share before we open up for questions"
4936.200,4937.000," and discussion"
4939.200,4940.800," oh I think we've got it really"
4941.400,4941.800," I am"
4943.900,4944.300," I I think this"
4944.800,4947.900," probably doesn't need to be said but here it is anyway what if home"
4948.500,4949.600," is not actually a place"
4954.200,4955.900," perhaps home is really a function"
4957.000,4957.700," of the heart"
4960.300,4963.400," we've maybe lucky enough to have known places where the heart"
4963.900,4964.700," was able to function"
4965.500,4966.700," in whatever way that is"
4968.800,4969.600," but if home"
4970.100,4972.400," has certain properties of feeling"
4973.400,4976.000," if it's marked by certain kinds of them"
4977.200,4978.400," where the heart"
4979.000,4980.100," is allowed in able to"
4980.800,4982.800," feel those things to function in those ways"
4983.900,4984.400," then that's"
4984.900,4985.400," home"
4994.700,4996.200," what is the purpose of practice"
4997.300,4998.400," is simply the comfort"
5006.600,5008.900," see what I mean I mean I mean maybe maybe that's not"
5009.500,5011.500," not obvious we may not have"
5012.400,5013.000," framed it"
5014.800,5016.000," that but what happens if we do"
5016.700,5018.600," what if the purpose of this practice"
5019.400,5020.400," or these practices"
5021.700,5023.000," is simply to come home"
5028.100,5028.800," rather than"
5030.900,5032.200," the adventure to"
5034.400,5036.600," conquer new Territories of experience"
5038.400,5039.100," which may be"
5039.800,5041.000," I don't know I mean it could be"
5043.100,5046.200," full Hardy young men who get into practice it"
5046.900,5049.700," like myself might have tended to think of it"
5050.700,5051.300," I want to sort of"
5051.800,5054.000," I want to conquer this thing called enlightenment"
5054.600,5055.300," you know I want to set up"
5055.800,5060.400," I want to I want to you know expand the Horizons of experiences and adventure"
5060.600,5062.500," I mean it's okay there's that's all fine you know"
5063.100,5065.200," that whatever motivates us to do is actually good"
5065.800,5067.300," but what if really what it"
5068.500,5069.100," is in fact"
5070.000,5070.600," coming home"
5084.600,5086.000," and what if"
5086.700,5087.400," coming home"
5089.300,5090.400," memes"
5093.000,5093.300," really"
5094.400,5095.900," a certain kind of functioning"
5097.100,5097.600," of this"
5098.700,5100.000," strange organ"
5100.900,5104.200," but we're not really meaning in organ when we talk about the heart"
5105.200,5106.000," the meaning this"
5106.800,5108.500," like energy center this"
5110.800,5111.500," this place"
5112.100,5112.400," this"
5113.100,5113.400," part"
5116.600,5117.600," what if it's actually"
5118.400,5118.600," you know"
5119.500,5122.100," I mean some of you you know have"
5122.600,5124.000," been in this program for a one"
5124.500,5125.200," you know that I mean"
5125.800,5127.600," it's really important to include"
5129.200,5130.300," The Troubles of the heart"
5131.500,5132.200," in our practice"
5133.500,5135.900," and in a way this is another dimension of coming home"
5136.600,5138.200," and it's worth stating because"
5139.100,5142.100," it's an easy thing to get into like"
5142.900,5144.400," I've got all this heartache"
5145.100,5145.900," and I got all these"
5146.800,5147.700," you know hassles"
5148.600,5149.900," damn I need a break"
5150.200,5151.900," I'm going to go into my practice"
5152.500,5153.600," to find some peace"
5154.400,5155.200," away from that"
5157.300,5160.800," I mean it's actually fair enough we do need a break sometimes"
5161.700,5162.900," and it's good to be"
5163.700,5164.100," finding that"
5165.200,5165.200," but"
5166.100,5166.600," isn't the"
5167.400,5173.400," I mean the deeper invitation the deeper possibility the greater possibility the more valuable possibility really"
5174.100,5175.200," is what would it take"
5176.200,5176.400," to"
5177.500,5179.800," have a relationship with my heart"
5182.100,5182.400," where"
5183.200,5184.900," I sort of Let It"
5185.800,5186.400," come first"
5187.700,5189.200," that the real homecoming"
5190.400,5191.000," is not to"
5191.600,5192.800," some place of peace"
5194.000,5196.700," that I can sort of managed to get to the gives me some relief"
5197.000,5198.000," from what's going on here"
5199.000,5199.600," not that"
5200.600,5201.200," but instead"
5202.600,5204.000," offering a place of peace"
5204.600,5205.600," within my heart"
5206.100,5207.600," to my hearts troubles"
5208.600,5209.200," you see what I mean"
5210.300,5212.000," like letting this heart be"
5214.400,5215.300," a place of peace"
5216.700,5217.400," but does not"
5218.300,5218.700," vanish"
5219.600,5220.100," heartache"
5223.400,5225.700," I think it's important to talk about this because"
5226.400,5228.300," if we can accommodate"
5229.200,5229.800," arte"
5230.300,5231.400," and even heartbreak"
5232.500,5233.100," um"
5234.200,5234.900," then we're not"
5235.800,5237.500," sort of evicted from our home"
5237.800,5238.900," from our natural home"
5240.800,5242.000," we don't have to go on a"
5242.500,5243.700," lonely wondering"
5244.400,5245.800," because it's not comfortable back here"
5248.400,5249.800," do you see what I mean is this clear like"
5250.300,5251.100," the real home"
5251.500,5252.300," has gone to be here"
5253.600,5255.700," and that means being able to accommodate"
5256.400,5257.500," what's going on here"
5262.300,5262.900," it doesn't mean"
5263.700,5264.000," I'm going to"
5264.900,5267.700," Vanquish new new Territories"
5269.000,5270.600," I'm going to go in the mountains"
5272.000,5272.900," Slayer dragon or two"
5273.300,5276.500," and then be able to sit in bless it peace on the mountain top"
5276.800,5277.600," in a hermitage"
5278.800,5280.500," by nobody can reach me none of that"
5280.900,5283.400," messed down their can reach me because I'm up there"
5284.300,5285.400," it doesn't it I don't think that's"
5286.900,5287.200," I mean"
5288.000,5292.000," maybe that can be for a while if we're called like that I don't know"
5292.700,5293.900," but it does seem that the"
5294.900,5296.000," real homecoming"
5298.400,5299.100," I'm pretty sure"
5299.900,5301.700," that the real homecoming it could be the"
5302.100,5304.200," that is part of the path for some of us"
5305.000,5307.500," but I think the real homecoming that I'm talking about"
5309.400,5309.600," is"
5310.500,5311.500," the one that"
5313.700,5315.200," that is okay with heartbreak"
5317.300,5318.000," that in a sense"
5318.400,5319.000," perhaps"
5319.800,5321.500," can't really happen without heart rate"
5322.700,5324.200," which may sound a bit weird but"
5325.000,5325.900," there's something about"
5329.100,5330.900," the wisdom of our hearts really"
5331.400,5332.200," if they break"
5333.600,5334.400," if they're going through"
5335.800,5337.100," a phase of heart rate"
5346.300,5348.500," they that it's a great"
5349.100,5353.200," learning opportunity so great growth opportunity is the chance"
5354.000,5354.200," to"
5357.500,5358.900," it's a chance to shatter"
5359.900,5362.200," our restrictive"
5363.800,5367.300," intentions about ourselves and about this our approach to the world"
5367.900,5368.800," and our understanding"
5369.500,5370.800," to let go of understanding"
5371.600,5373.300," to assume that we might not know best"
5374.200,5375.500," to let go"
5375.900,5376.900," of understanding"
5377.400,5378.100," to release"
5378.800,5379.600," our knowing"
5380.300,5380.900," to go into"
5382.200,5384.400," the actually beautiful dark"
5385.000,5385.700," of not knowing"
5387.400,5387.600," the"
5388.400,5388.500," the"
5389.200,5389.800," find"
5390.400,5390.900," sweet"
5392.000,5392.500," Darkness"
5393.400,5394.100," of not knowing"
5396.200,5398.900," that brings us actually face to face with"
5399.900,5400.700," with mystery"
5404.700,5404.800," and"
5405.600,5407.500," then our Heartbreakers is"
5409.100,5410.100," is wisdom"
5411.000,5412.300," and becomes an open heart"
5417.100,5419.700," and then the Open Heart has a shot of being a hole"
5422.200,5423.600," I can't really ever hold harm"
5424.600,5425.600," without an open heart"
5426.700,5428.600," probably maybe can't really have a"
5429.000,5430.600," you can't have an open heart"
5431.100,5432.500," if it's not open to The Heartbreak"
5444.100,5444.900," so okay"
5446.800,5448.500," okay so let's let's um"
5450.400,5457.700," let me let and let what Henry please be quiet for a bit and let's hear some reflections and comments and questions"
5458.800,5458.900," so"
5460.700,5465.200," yeah let me I'll look at the chat but I think let's do raise a hand if you want to"
5466.000,5467.200," share or ask anything"
5468.700,5469.100," and we'll"
5470.000,5471.400," we'll proceed from there"
5472.400,5474.200," let me just have I just want one little"
5474.800,5476.800," moment to look at the chat just to absorb it"
5480.600,5481.900," okay let's see"
5488.200,5488.300," yeah"
5488.900,5492.400," it feels like the body Sat but within us all I love that that's right exactly"
5492.900,5494.900," letting me unwanted be one to"
5496.200,5497.400," lovely that actually"
5498.300,5500.000," that reminds me of the beautiful"
5501.500,5505.200," You Know The Stone the builders refused will be my cornerstone"
5507.300,5509.300," I think that's out of That's Jesus I think"
5509.800,5510.700," but it's also in"
5511.600,5512.400," Peter Tosh"
5513.000,5513.200," you know"
5513.600,5514.500," from the Wailers"
5515.300,5518.300," Peter Tosh and Bob Marley worked together in the Wailers"
5518.800,5521.500," that a great song The Stone the builders refused"
5522.100,5528.300," will always be my head cornerstone the stone at the Builder ref"
5529.100,5532.100," cornerstone"
5532.300,5535.300," but just taking in what is what is saying the stone"
5535.800,5537.400," the builders refused"
5538.100,5539.500," not good enough that's done"
5540.200,5540.900," that's the one"
5541.900,5542.600," that's the one"
5543.800,5545.300," so it's an invitation to us"
5545.700,5547.100," what am I refusing"
5550.400,5550.700," okay"
5551.500,5551.900," Dave"
5552.600,5554.400," hi Dave from Austin howdy"
5558.500,5559.000," hey Henry"
5559.800,5559.900," hey"
5560.900,5564.800," just got back from this amazing trip to Costa Rica and"
5566.400,5569.100," yeah there's some pretty cool dudes they're teaching"
5570.400,5576.100," so I you know it was interesting I got back to this morning after very long travel day"
5577.200,5577.500," yesterday"
5578.800,5581.100," and I woke up and I had this feeling"
5581.800,5582.800," that"
5584.200,5587.100," almost nothing had changed yet everything had changed"
5587.900,5589.400," and it was a feeling of"
5590.300,5593.200," what you're talking about coming home it's it's like"
5593.900,5595.200," I'm home now but"
5595.800,5597.300," I was always home"
5598.000,5599.300," when I was on that trip"
5600.000,5600.300," and"
5601.500,5604.200," yet there's this meaning of going on the trip that"
5605.500,5606.900," was worth the effort"
5607.500,5612.200," and I just wondering what your thoughts and you're your reflection to where on travel"
5612.900,5615.000," going somewhere coming back coming home"
5616.000,5620.100," baby in the context of some of us who might be travelling to your in person"
5620.800,5623.400," coming up here pretty soon so anyway"
5624.000,5625.000," thanks to the opportunity"
5626.400,5630.200," great to see you today was down in Costa Rica with us this past week"
5632.300,5635.200," quite a it's a great to be done today and"
5636.400,5642.200," yeah I mean I think there's we can't deny that there's some place for"
5645.000,5646.600," different different sort of"
5647.300,5649.600," settings for practice and the value of"
5650.500,5654.300," going somewhere I mean in a physical journey to a physical place"
5655.000,5656.100," has its"
5657.400,5661.800," you know has its place in human spiritual development for sure"
5662.500,5666.500," um there are you know there's sites of pilgrimage that have long been"
5667.600,5670.000," valuable but for people to decide"
5670.700,5672.600," I'm going to set aside this time"
5673.300,5674.800," and I'm going to prioritise"
5675.400,5677.300," journeying to a particular place"
5677.900,5680.300," and sometimes the journey there is a big part of it"
5680.700,5682.200," or just I'm going to go there"
5682.600,5684.600," and be in this sequestered place"
5685.300,5686.800," in order to prioritise"
5687.500,5688.400," some aspects of"
5689.000,5689.500," of my"
5690.200,5691.200," spiritual development"
5691.800,5692.200," that's"
5693.000,5693.100," that's"
5693.900,5695.500," you know that's got its value"
5701.300,5703.600," so I you know that's something for us all to explore"
5705.000,5705.900," at the same time"
5707.600,5711.000," I do really think that the home"
5712.100,5713.100," we're looking for"
5714.500,5716.200," and the home that we can"
5718.900,5720.500," subside into"
5721.100,5722.000," all into"
5722.500,5723.200," more and more"
5725.100,5726.600," is always right here"
5727.600,5728.400," wherever we are"
5730.600,5732.700," yeah you know there's a kind of a"
5733.000,5734.400," they're used to talk about the"
5735.000,5738.500," I can't remember exact phrasing we're sort of person in a box"
5739.200,5740.300," test or something like that"
5741.000,5742.300," like if you were"
5743.700,5744.500," if you were"
5745.500,5749.900," confined to a box with a few tubes going in and out"
5750.700,5751.600," to support your life"
5752.400,5753.400," for the rest of your life"
5754.100,5755.100," could you be at peace"
5755.700,5756.200," as a kind of"
5756.800,5758.300," benchmark of your practice"
5759.400,5761.100," and I'm not say I always sort of"
5762.100,5763.800," kind of thought no fucking way"
5766.300,5772.300," you did my language but actually there was a point in my practice when I really realised how possible that was"
5772.900,5774.700," that there was a point in my parents this one"
5775.600,5777.500," it was just that total"
5778.400,5780.200," Total fulfillment was just present"
5780.600,5782.400," the total fulfillment was just present"
5782.900,5783.400," and nothing"
5784.100,5785.300," really nothing more was needed"
5786.000,5787.300," and I write I think"
5788.300,5790.600," I don't know whether I'm always thinking that there's"
5791.200,5793.100," successive stages of practice that"
5793.900,5794.900," I mean there's a as a"
5795.500,5798.800," young Buck I also I'd seen it all I'd seen it all you know at some"
5799.300,5802.000," some sort of parts of Horizon suddenly store"
5802.400,5803.200," great New Vista"
5803.800,5804.700," now got"
5804.800,5805.700," it I've seen it"
5806.200,5806.600," all and then"
5807.200,5811.700," actually you know a few weeks or a few months or a few years on"
5812.300,5813.000," oh no"
5813.400,5815.100," there's another Whole New Vista"
5815.400,5817.000," an on and on like that and"
5817.500,5819.600," and then there's vistas within"
5819.900,5820.500," that have to be"
5821.000,5821.800," opened up as well"
5822.400,5822.500," and"
5823.400,5825.200," so I don't think there's any"
5825.800,5830.000," End to practice so I think that that little test is all very well"
5830.700,5834.200," but actually more important perhaps at some point maybe well how are we"
5834.800,5836.300," how are we manifesting it in the world"
5837.200,5838.600," you know yeah maybe you could be"
5839.500,5842.400," buying in a box but assuming you're not in a box what are you doing"
5843.300,5846.900," to help you know and and you know then has that you know the"
5847.400,5848.200," the end of the"
5848.800,5852.200," 10 Oxford and pictures or eight ox earning pictures in some versions"
5852.800,5853.500," in the Zen tradition"
5854.100,5854.600," is not"
5855.300,5857.300," at peace in the Hermitage on the mountain top"
5857.800,5859.200," is down in the marketplace"
5859.700,5860.500," bringing gifts"
5861.300,5861.500," you know"
5862.100,5864.700," back in normal normal normal normal normal normal normal life"
5865.800,5868.500," you know and that turns out the whole journey of exploration"
5870.400,5871.400," Waze Preparatory"
5872.000,5872.700," wasn't quite"
5873.500,5874.800," in and of itself the sink"
5878.100,5878.600," so"
5879.200,5879.900," aprop"
5880.800,5882.700," going Places it may well be"
5883.500,5884.500," yeah part of our"
5885.700,5887.200," part of our journey that's"
5887.600,5887.800," that's great"
5888.600,5892.500," there's something sweet and you know yeah I know some of you are coming to Santa Fe"
5893.200,5895.600," the later part of this week for our"
5896.100,5899.900," in-person of first ever reason love in Person of event"
5900.200,5901.900," so that's a change because"
5902.400,5903.800," the value I think of this program"
5904.200,5905.100," my point of view"
5905.400,5907.000," and the sounded like for many is like"
5907.400,5908.600," actually having practice"
5909.300,5909.800," sessions"
5910.300,5911.300," riding our homes"
5912.200,5913.800," that you know you just go to the living room"
5914.300,5915.000," go to the kitchen"
5915.700,5916.700," that's really in a sense"
5917.100,5918.500," where practice needs to happen"
5919.300,5922.000," and as how alive is our practice when we're making breakfast"
5923.000,5923.100," you know"
5925.000,5927.700," that's also another kind of litmus test"
5929.700,5929.900," so yeah"
5930.400,5931.700," thanks Nicole hi"
5942.000,5943.600," a nickel meet unmute"
5945.500,5946.300," can you hear me now"
5946.900,5947.200," yeah"
5947.800,5948.100," okay"
5949.000,5951.100," we'll first I'm so happy to see you Henry"
5951.700,5954.300," and I so deeply appreciate your teaching"
5955.600,5958.700," and I just want to share that since the last"
5959.200,5959.500," session"
5960.200,5961.200," of original love"
5961.900,5964.800," I've been meditating with one bright pearl"
5966.100,5966.400," and"
5968.400,5969.600," and I had an experience"
5971.900,5974.800," as I guess they happen that they just happened"
5976.000,5976.100," when"
5977.200,5977.700," everything"
5979.900,5980.400," became"
5981.800,5982.100," like"
5984.800,5986.700," and it was such an extraordinary feeling"
5987.300,5988.400," and it didn't last long"
5991.700,5996.000," but it was my first sort of experience and I just wanted to share that"
5996.800,5997.000," and"
5997.800,5998.200," thank you"
5999.500,6000.200," Nicole thank you"
6001.200,6002.400," thank you so much for sharing that"
6002.900,6004.400," let me just check out how did he say"
6004.900,6006.300," everything became light"
6007.600,6008.900," it's sort of like you know I was"
6009.500,6010.600," sitting with one but"
6012.300,6013.100," and then in"
6013.900,6014.500," everything"
6015.400,6019.000," it was no longer it was just everything just expanded"
6019.500,6020.700," into this light"
6021.100,6021.800," into this"
6022.600,6023.600," endless light"
6024.100,6024.300," yes"
6025.300,6025.500," like"
6026.000,6028.200," how sweet how beautiful wonderful and"
6030.200,6033.400," yeah and it cut right through between you and the world right there was no"
6034.200,6036.600," exams like that ya is that it's just one"
6037.500,6038.000," one"
6039.000,6045.600," light yeah I get it I think that's you know really he was expressing that don't you think one bright oh"
6048.000,6050.200," exactly that's the point is one"
6050.700,6052.400," I think the most emphatic thing"
6052.800,6055.200," in one bright pearl is actually the word one"
6056.300,6056.600," now"
6058.900,6059.600," and yeah it can"
6059.900,6064.900," I mean I'm with it can show up I'd say there are different faces will see of it actually like"
6065.600,6068.400," light absolutely just one"
6069.000,6069.400," brightness"
6070.100,6072.000," illumination 1 illumination"
6072.700,6074.400," and sometimes it's even one"
6075.600,6077.100," scintillating Darkness"
6077.700,6078.600," it can be that way too"
6079.200,6080.100," and sometimes it's just"
6080.600,6081.500," one awareness"
6082.800,6084.600," one and I think it's also it's really"
6085.700,6088.700," the heart at this do you know it's that feeling of"
6089.200,6091.300," it's just such an openness set"
6091.900,6092.200," yeah"
6093.500,6095.900," ah sweet so so everybody else"
6096.400,6097.600," just note"
6098.200,6102.800," you know these things happen and the reason they happen is that they're real"
6103.700,6105.700," you know that with they are a very"
6106.200,6108.300," own consciousness Right Here and Now"
6109.300,6110.600," it actually has"
6111.500,6114.500," kind of you could say different levels in it right now"
6115.800,6116.000," and"
6117.000,6118.500," and and and and and and and in this program"
6119.200,6120.100," that point is"
6120.900,6123.000," all we're doing is sinking more"
6124.200,6125.300," into who and what we are"
6126.300,6126.500," through"
6127.800,6129.700," it's like I think the image will be more like"
6130.200,6130.700," instead of"
6131.300,6132.800," clinging to keep up"
6133.700,6136.100," I don't know like we're pulling ourselves out so we can see"
6136.800,6137.900," where we're used to seeing"
6138.500,6139.400," we just let go"
6140.200,6140.500," hmm"
6140.900,6143.900," that's the that's the idea in this program we're just releasing that"
6144.500,6145.500," and coming home"
6146.200,6146.400," more"
6147.200,6147.500," than more"
6148.200,6149.500," and more and more and there may be"
6150.500,6152.600," levels of that homecoming where"
6153.900,6155.100," all that sense of"
6156.800,6158.200," separate me"
6159.400,6160.600," distinct from world"
6162.000,6164.600," they just blur or vanish"
6165.600,6166.500," so we discover"
6169.300,6171.100," a singularity"
6171.700,6172.900," a one mess"
6175.900,6178.000," okay thank you for saying that beautiful"
6179.000,6179.200," great"
6179.600,6180.500," hey Sean hi"
6185.200,6185.800," I Henry"
6187.600,6190.200," thank you very much for your talk today beautiful"
6190.900,6194.300," so great to be getting started again and another year how the original love"
6196.000,6201.400," I don't have to ask about an experience I had where I was walking up in the middle of the night"
6202.600,6206.500," and I was pushing myself up from my bed because something seemed to be coming"
6207.400,6208.200," up from underneath"
6208.700,6208.900," and"
6210.100,6211.400," I suddenly fell into"
6212.400,6213.400," this boundless"
6214.500,6217.500," face and and sometimes and feel like I'm still falling"
6219.700,6221.900," north south east west wherever I look"
6222.200,6224.700," I can't get to the end of it and it's"
6225.100,6225.900," at the luminous"
6227.200,6227.500," space"
6229.100,6230.300," and I've wondered now how do I"
6231.200,6233.700," work with this you know where is the space and"
6234.300,6236.400," is it right here right now is it"
6237.400,6242.400," it felt like the inside of my heart actually felt like ah yes yes yes"
6243.200,6249.000," she will not beautiful wow wow it's it's quite the day for c having time off you see how valuable it is"
6249.300,6250.100," we have a mess"
6250.600,6256.400," it's December or whatever the last one was and all this was Harvest of amazing experiences"
6257.000,6257.200," see"
6258.000,6264.200," but yeah Sean I mean you're on it that's it I mean well actually what you know just just just just just question"
6264.700,6269.000," I would question why need to work with it what does that even mean"
6270.400,6271.100," yeah there's nothing"
6271.800,6273.000," there to work with as they're"
6273.300,6273.400," not"
6274.200,6274.800," there's nobody"
6275.800,6276.800," to work with it"
6277.100,6280.100," there's see that the question how do I work with it comes from"
6282.100,6283.400," it doesn't ask that question"
6284.600,6284.900," mmm"
6285.500,6285.900," see what I mean"
6286.500,6286.800," comes from"
6288.000,6290.000," yeah exactly it's just a thought really"
6290.400,6291.800," we're just you can just release it"
6292.700,6293.600," it is always present"
6294.100,6295.300," it's always present"
6298.200,6299.900," and I liked the way you describe that"
6300.400,6302.600," that falling and I still be going on"
6303.800,6304.200," mmm"
6305.300,6306.000," I'm trying to find"
6307.500,6307.900," what's that"
6308.500,6309.600," trying to find the bottom but"
6310.100,6312.100," it can't can't find it can't see any"
6314.100,6314.600," no bottom"
6317.500,6318.000," there's uhm"
6318.900,6320.900," there's there's a there is a teaching"
6321.900,6326.400," especially strong and terravida that everything is constantly"
6328.200,6331.200," everything the whole of our experience is constantly"
6332.600,6334.100," a rising and"
6335.000,6335.700," collapsing"
6336.700,6337.400," at the same time"
6338.700,6340.500," both arising coming forth"
6341.400,6341.600," and"
6342.900,6343.600," collapsing"
6344.100,6345.300," Ali"
6345.900,6347.200," you could say endlessly"
6347.800,6349.900," endlessly arising endlessly"
6350.800,6351.200," falling"
6352.600,6353.300," and beautiful"
6353.900,6355.400," yeah and that means now"
6356.000,6356.600," means now"
6357.100,6357.800," it means now"
6358.700,6359.100," now"
6362.000,6363.500," so these are the understand"
6364.800,6365.500," you know it's a very"
6366.100,6367.700," very often we you know we have some"
6368.400,6370.600," opening and we discover boundless space"
6371.400,6372.200," or boundless"
6373.200,6374.100," or bound us"
6375.000,6377.900," emptiness or whatever it flavour in my opinion"
6378.600,6380.000," and then it's just so"
6380.600,6381.000," common"
6381.500,6382.800," that want to understand"
6383.800,6385.400," it well instead of get a handle"
6386.300,6386.900," on it but actually"
6387.600,6389.300," in the experience itself"
6389.500,6391.300," that is not getting the handle"
6392.200,6393.700," there is no understanding it"
6394.000,6394.700," no need"
6395.600,6396.100," no need"
6397.000,6399.600," that's a gradually but it's very natural that"
6400.300,6404.300," kind of sense of a need to do that comes back but actually we don't need to and our"
6404.600,6406.400," the ongoing path is to"
6407.400,6409.700," inhabit that more while doing our daily"
6410.400,6411.300," the daily round"
6411.700,6412.400," having a conversation"
6413.800,6416.000," sending on zoom right this you know it's not"
6416.600,6417.500," not present"
6417.900,6418.300," just because"
6419.000,6424.800," we're focusing I mean I'm you know I'm talking to you now and it's fully proud of this boundlessness"
6425.400,6427.400," holy but no there's no need for it not to be"
6428.200,6429.100," because it just is"
6429.600,6430.500," you know so practice"
6431.500,6434.400," yeah on it goes well lovely lovely thank you Sean"
6434.900,6435.900," so thank you Mark hi"
6437.300,6437.400," yeah"
6438.200,6438.800," hi Emma"
6443.000,6445.300," hello Henry thank you so much for your talk today"
6445.800,6446.600," it was wonderful"
6447.500,6448.300," this is my first year"
6448.900,6452.400," uh doing original love so I can't wait to to feel the light"
6453.500,6453.600," but"
6454.500,6455.800," my question is around"
6456.600,6457.200," I've been meditating"
6459.900,6462.500," diligently for the last three years or so"
6464.000,6466.100," and as I meditate I have found that"
6467.100,6468.300," more aware of"
6468.800,6469.200," suffering"
6471.100,6471.900," like in my life and"
6472.300,6472.600," around"
6473.600,6474.500," the lives of other people"
6476.100,6478.700," and most of the times that kind of feels like a"
6479.800,6481.400," soft melon collie"
6482.800,6484.400," but there-- are times where"
6485.400,6486.900," It Feels Like a deep sorrow"
6488.700,6488.900," and"
6490.500,6492.500," it's hard to create space around that"
6493.500,6494.700," I was wondering if you had any"
6495.600,6496.100," insight"
6496.400,6497.000," or guidance"
6498.900,6501.500," yes okay thank you for bringing that I'm on"
6502.000,6504.200," bringing that up I'm a I would say this like"
6504.700,6508.500," not knowing anything about the particularities of it like I don't know where the"
6508.900,6509.400," you have"
6510.100,6513.100," you know people you're close to who are going through hard things or"
6513.800,6517.200," you know whether you yourself are going through hard things or some combination thereof"
6518.900,6523.200," most of us I think do by the way it's you know it's very common that"
6523.900,6525.000," somehow in our"
6525.500,6527.900," immediate circle there will be suffering and"
6528.400,6532.000," sometimes it's more manifestly our own and some of this more manifest the others"
6532.700,6535.100," and certainly in our slightly wider circles there will be"
6535.600,6537.300," and then we look at the world and there's just"
6538.200,6541.400," pounding Wars going on you know they're just creating"
6542.100,6543.700," so much misery and suffering"
6544.100,6546.500," and often it seems so pointlessly like"
6547.100,6549.700," this surely this could be done differently you know it's"
6550.100,6551.800," it's it can be very disheartening"
6553.000,6553.100," so"
6554.000,6558.200," there's lots of different sort of levels and approaches and ways we can think about this and approached it but"
6558.800,6560.900," but one thing I would say is that"
6562.100,6565.300," you know I think somebody is sad in the chat something about the body fat"
6566.000,6567.000," and the bodega"
6568.000,6568.600," is someone"
6569.300,6574.200," who this is in mahayana Buddhism I said I don't want to get to technical but"
6574.600,6576.800," you know a bodies have let's just say in principle"
6577.300,6579.200," is somebody who lives with an open heart"
6579.800,6582.600," and in other words they're not closed to suffering"
6584.000,6586.600," but their response to it is compassion"
6588.000,6589.800," and compassion means that the wish"
6590.400,6591.200," that suffering"
6592.000,6592.700," be released"
6594.200,6596.400," it doesn't just mean empathising"
6596.900,6597.600," profoundly"
6598.400,6600.700," and feeling the same suffering that others are feeling"
6601.600,6604.800," the research especially interestingly on this there's quite a bit"
6605.200,6605.700," is that"
6605.800,6606.600," empathy"
6607.700,6608.000," is"
6611.400,6613.600," let me just say that the there's research into"
6614.000,6615.600," empathy vs"
6616.000,6616.600," compassion"
6617.300,6619.700," empathy is feeling the suffering about them"
6620.300,6621.200," but it does not"
6621.700,6625.100," seem to galvanise compassionate action"
6625.800,6628.100," the same way that compassion does"
6629.000,6631.700," but there's a in other words that there's a distinction between"
6632.200,6633.900," simply feeling the suffering of Brothers"
6634.400,6635.000," vs"
6635.900,6636.300," feeling"
6636.700,6638.200," the compassionate wish"
6638.800,6640.400," that others be relieved are suffering"
6640.800,6643.700," but also we must remember that that compassionate wish"
6644.300,6646.400," applies to us as well"
6647.500,6647.900," you know there's a"
6648.500,6652.100," I think there's something I was going to say that I didn't quite say my tool cash is that"
6652.800,6656.400," they're sort of the overall kind of project in non-duality of"
6657.000,6658.300," seeing through the cell"
6659.300,6661.600," can very easily be co-opted"
6662.500,6663.800," there's a there's a there's a self"
6664.700,6666.100," there's a self-acceptance"
6666.400,6667.000," issue"
6667.600,6669.600," in western culture"
6670.200,6672.400," like there's a thing in western culture"
6672.800,6676.400," and it probably comes out of the Judea Christian heritage may be"
6676.700,6679.600," maybe maybe it comes out of the Industrial Revolution or I don't know"
6680.100,6681.100," where we're not"
6681.500,6682.600," a lot of people"
6684.800,6685.100," don't"
6685.800,6687.100," believe in self-acceptance"
6688.100,6688.900," they think that somehow"
6689.500,6691.500," or it still less self-compassion"
6692.300,6692.900," that somehow"
6693.400,6695.300," it's wrong to be kind to oneself"
6695.800,6697.900," it's self-indulgent to be kind to myself"
6698.600,6699.800," and there's a real danger"
6700.600,6701.300," but us"
6702.000,6704.100," but anybody who's a Western practitioner"
6704.700,6706.100," of using their practice"
6707.600,6709.600," as part of that self self"
6710.100,6711.100," hey hate Project"
6711.800,6713.500," or self non-acceptance Project"
6714.200,6715.200," well here's this practice saying"
6715.600,6717.700," hey yourself not real and you can see through it"
6718.300,6719.800," alright let me do that because I hate myself"
6720.200,6720.300," you know"
6721.000,6722.800," actually that's that's not the point at all"
6723.600,6725.400," actually we we really must"
6726.100,6728.700," have love for us ourselves compassion for ourselves"
6729.100,6729.400," I believe"
6730.200,6730.700," that's so"
6731.400,6732.200," so compassion"
6733.100,6733.600," for self"
6734.000,6734.300," and"
6734.700,6735.200," others"
6736.200,6736.500," is"
6737.500,6742.600," is the response and I personally I don't know I seem to find that more"
6743.600,6746.700," by allowing myself to be heartbroken when I am heart"

6861.100,6862.600," online Gathering nice to meet you"
6863.100,6865.300," I'm going to sort of reminds me of you know when I was talking about the"
6866.100,6870.400," how this program started actually on that beach to in Venezuela you know was like"
6871.200,6875.400," you yeah there's this harmony is a good word actually I like that it's that's"
6876.000,6877.000," that's kind of what I was feeling"
6877.500,6880.000," in those circumstances and that's what I'm trying to share"
6880.900,6881.500," like this very"
6882.500,6883.700," simple comfortable"
6885.000,6887.400," loving approach to Meditation where we're not"
6887.900,6888.800," when not"
6891.700,6894.500," we're not saying it's going to be this way all that way actually"
6895.600,6899.000," you know I I think it's you know I haven't been through"
6900.800,6904.800," especially particular kind of training in zen but also other kinds of trainers"
6905.000,6906.700," I know there's different approaches"
6907.500,6907.600," and"
6908.300,6911.000," and somewhere in there there's this approach of just"
6914.000,6914.400," being"
6915.400,6915.900," just being"
6916.900,6917.400," just being"
6919.100,6921.200," so the practice doesn't become another thing we do"
6922.200,6923.500," is the dropping of doing"
6926.400,6927.400," very simple"
6929.300,6932.400," and you know I think it's what we're missing actually you know"
6933.000,6934.500," ordinary round of things so another"
6935.000,6938.600," great that we have projects and then we're busy with stuff no problem with that"
6939.200,6940.300," but we also"
6940.900,6941.600," need"
6942.600,6945.000," every day a little bit of space where"
6945.600,6947.800," we're actually not doing to just kind of"
6948.400,6951.800," honour the very fact that we exist is how I feel it"
6952.300,6955.400," it's so you know the most important thing of all is that you exist"
6956.300,6958.800," that's the most important thing you actually"
6959.300,6960.300," exist now"
6960.700,6962.200," what that existence is"
6962.600,6965.500," can indeed be studied and get pretty damn interesting"
6966.200,6969.200," but the but the basic fact that you exist"
6970.000,6970.300," you"
6971.200,6971.900," exist"
6973.100,6974.400," that's the most important thing"
6975.000,6975.500," of all"
6977.100,6978.600," and we so easily"
6979.200,6979.900," overlooked it"
6980.900,6982.400," but I see practice as"
6982.800,6983.800," the most"
6984.900,6985.800," cookie"
6986.400,6989.400," basic was sort of responsibility of a practice"
6989.900,6990.800," is to help us"
6991.500,6992.100," acknowledge"
6992.700,6995.600," and be aware of the fact that we exist"
6996.800,6997.100," that's the"
6998.200,6999.400," that's the basic thing"
7000.000,7001.100," okay so that's what I'm hoping"
7001.800,7002.000," this"
7002.600,7003.600," program this year"
7004.000,7005.200," will help us all do"
7005.600,7006.500," is recognise"
7007.000,7008.300," that we exist"
