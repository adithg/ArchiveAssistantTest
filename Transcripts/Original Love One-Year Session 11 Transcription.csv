170.600,171.100," some of these"
172.200,173.200," chats"
174.300,179.100," yeah crying in Santa Fe everybody everything is welcome here that's the whole principal of"
180.000,183.000," original Love Actually as the program and as the reality"
183.400,184.600," of our lives is that"
185.400,186.600," there is there is"
187.700,189.500," something that welcomes"
190.200,190.400," all"
191.200,194.800," of us that welcomes all of us that has an intrinsic"
195.800,201.400," you know capacity to have offer a welcome that we can actually feel as humans and that's"
202.500,204.500," I mean it's a good place to start actually because"
205.300,206.500," that's why"
207.500,211.500," this kind of practice is worth it"
212.100,213.500," it's not just sort of"
215.100,217.900," philosophical exploration as it work"
218.200,219.300," it has the most"
220.300,224.000," profound and intimate and a media impact on our"
224.700,225.300," on our"
225.500,227.200," on our lives on on our"
227.700,229.800," closest closest sense of self in a"
232.500,233.000," and"
233.600,237.100," I was okay let me I'm going to just"
237.700,240.900," having said that I'm actually one of just a little introductory"
242.900,245.200," thing I just wanted to to say as we're"
246.700,252.100," threading through these 3 sessions on the factors of Awakening doing and undoing"
253.000,255.700," factors of Awakening just a little bit of a"
256.300,260.400," recap and sort of scene setting very briefly before we go into our first sit"
261.600,261.800," um"
264.000,264.500," doing"
266.000,266.600," and undoing"
267.100,268.100," doing because"
268.600,269.600," we do"
270.600,273.400," in a for this process to unfold"
274.000,275.600," then we'll get to what that is"
276.100,276.600," in a moment"
277.200,277.200," but"
278.400,284.300," for that to happen we need to do something on our side which is basically creating a context"
285.200,287.300," in which a certain kind of unfolding"
288.200,289.600," that we don't normally"
292.500,293.800,"uh think about or"
294.200,296.400," include in our human possibilities"
297.200,298.300," or make time for"
299.100,299.900," or space for"
300.300,301.900," a certain kind of unfolding"
302.400,303.100," that that is"
304.100,305.900," with this term Awakening and we're going to"
306.800,307.800," be exploring that more"
308.900,309.600," it needs"
310.600,315.200," something and what it basically needs is a bit of context a bit of space a bit of a"
315.600,315.800," little"
317.800,318.600," set aside"
319.000,319.800," zone"
320.800,321.800," where it can unfold"
322.700,323.600," and that's why"
324.300,325.700," basically we meditate"
326.100,329.300," because so that's our doing part we have to do that much"
330.000,331.900," the undoing side of it"
333.700,334.100," is that"
335.200,336.400," well there are"
337.700,341.400," meditation approaches that involve quite a lot of doing like"
342.400,343.500," do this do this do this"
344.300,347.600," then do this and this and then when x happens to y and when"
348.300,353.700," they happens to be and so on and they all have tremendous value and I believe in them myself I've used them"
354.400,357.100," many different kinds of methodologies and very very helpful"
357.800,358.600," and I love them all"
359.500,360.300," but there's also"
361.200,361.600," um"
362.400,364.600," two- aspects there of UN"
364.900,367.000," rather than doing one is"
368.300,370.800," what those great practices do"
371.700,374.400," in a certain way is undo us"
375.600,377.000," they have ways of"
379.600,380.500," untying"
381.500,382.000," there will not"
382.800,384.400," inside us that had been"
385.600,389.800," we thought very necessary to holding us together"
390.800,391.800," but we can find that"
392.500,395.100," actually wow we didn't need that after all"
395.800,396.400," and it's okay"
397.200,398.800," things don't collapse of fall apart"
399.600,402.900," and a certain kind of tension we've been unconsciously holding"
404.300,404.800," can release"
405.900,406.600," and we're still okay"
407.300,408.800," so that's one kind of undoing"
410.900,412.800," and the practice is do that to us"
413.800,415.500," and another kind of undoing"
416.200,419.100," is actually in the practice itself"
420.200,420.900," we just"
421.500,421.500," do"
422.700,423.300," less"
424.300,428.100," we actually can I mean this is there's various schools that"
429.100,430.700," include this as part of their"
432.200,432.700," whether"
433.200,434.500," of possible practices"
435.100,435.300," is"
435.900,436.200," not"
436.800,436.900," doing"
438.200,438.300," but"
439.400,440.300," really not"
441.200,441.400," doing"
443.900,444.500," UN"
447.100,448.800," the practice itself"
449.700,452.200," rather than being some kind of method of do this do that"
453.200,453.700," is actually"
454.600,455.200," to not"
455.600,455.700," do"
456.900,457.300," anything"
459.300,459.500," and"
461.500,464.700," you know some of you who are working with the app the way will know that there's"
465.200,465.900," a fair bit of"
466.900,469.400," the former kind of practice being taught there"
470.500,475.700," but gradually gradually it's about doing less and less and in this programme particularly"
476.300,478.400," you know that if there's a central method"
479.400,479.500," is"
481.200,481.800," undo"
482.700,483.200," not do"
484.100,484.600," don't do"
486.100,487.300," or simply do"
488.500,488.900," less"
489.700,490.300," all ways"
491.500,491.800," less"
493.900,494.000," and"
495.000,498.900," you know that opens up yeah I can open up so kind of vulnerability"
501.700,502.900," but it invites"
503.600,504.500," unexpected"
506.100,506.600," release"
509.300,510.300," and that is"
513.200,513.900," I would think"
516.000,516.300," I'm just"
516.900,518.000," flipping through some mental"
519.200,523.400," mental instances but I suspect that there is no"
523.800,525.000," cronico Awakening"
526.300,526.600," without"
528.300,528.900," release"
530.300,533.600," that every Glimmer glimpse hint hit"
534.800,535.600," or great wallet"
536.900,537.600," over wakening"
538.900,540.200," that you know I've seen people"
540.700,541.200," undergo"
543.000,543.300," is"
544.700,545.100," actually"
546.200,548.300," in a way nothing more that"
550.400,550.900," a release"
554.400,557.100," okay now why it's all worth it"
557.700,558.000," um"
558.800,560.500," we will get to as we go"
562.200,565.400," I'm very keen to start talking about it now but I won't be able to stop"
567.000,568.500," like so we're going to do our sit first"
569.600,569.900," and"
574.300,574.500," yeah"
576.600,579.700," so it just actually just before we begin I just do want to say"
586.100,586.400," you know"
588.300,594.700," all this all this all this stuff we're doing this Henry sharing stuff talking and the Sitting we do together and"
595.200,598.600," the whole body of stuff called practice that we"
600.000,602.400," open up in our our life if we do you know"
603.300,603.600," is"
604.300,606.900," actually it's in service is something so good"
607.900,611.100," it's about something so good so helpful"
612.100,613.300," for us humans"
614.600,615.900," you know it's really about"
617.800,618.800," coming back"
619.300,619.400," to"
621.900,624.400," a kind of intrinsic goodness"
627.300,628.400," about being alive"
629.700,631.200," and of course life has"
632.300,633.400," many things in it"
634.200,635.400," that don't seem good at all"
637.400,639.400," as well as things that clearly do seem good"
639.800,640.000," you know"
642.700,642.800," but"
644.600,645.200," finding"
646.900,647.700," a deep"
648.600,649.200," goodness"
650.600,651.800," in this very moment"
652.300,653.900," just in I mean not in"
654.700,656.900," sort of wider circumstances of the world"
657.600,661.000," not even in wider circumstances of our lives but"
661.600,661.900," right"
663.000,663.300," here"
664.200,667.300," now in this moment of existing"
668.500,669.900," of experiencing"
670.400,671.200," of being"
672.600,673.300," alive"
674.900,677.200," and you know whatever that actually is but"
678.600,679.000," being"
680.200,680.600," here"
681.800,682.100," now"
683.500,684.400," having this"
685.600,686.200," experience"
688.900,690.700," just in the absolute"
693.600,694.100," presence"
695.200,695.700," of now"
698.900,699.600," there is"
700.000,700.600," a kind of"
701.400,701.900," goodness"
703.100,704.100," so let's let's just"
705.800,708.400," let's just see where we go so please um let's"
708.900,709.500," get comfortable"
710.700,711.400," number one"
712.100,712.600," comfortable"
714.000,717.000," number two comfortable number three comfortable"
717.500,718.800," three most important things"
719.700,720.500," in meditation"
721.300,722.000," so that's really"
722.500,723.800," you know get yourself set up"
724.300,725.000," as you want to be"
726.100,727.800," I'm going to make a little adjustment here myself"
730.500,730.800," okay"
734.100,736.000," so get get your ya yourself"
736.900,740.600," established in a position that that you like essentially"
741.200,742.400," you know the feels good to you"
747.500,748.300," you're probably I mean"
749.500,751.400," you're welcome to look at the screen if you want but it probably"
751.900,753.800," don't don't want to or need to you know"
754.400,754.800," during this"
756.100,756.500," portion"
758.800,760.000," your eyes might be closed"
761.400,762.600," ear eyes might be open"
765.500,769.900," if so probably best with the guys lowered that's traditional wisdom"
774.600,775.600," and let's get the body"
777.600,779.700," well arranged so we're comfortable"
781.800,784.700," we if you're lying down this great if you're"
785.200,785.700," sitting"
786.600,787.500," let your um"
790.700,795.400," let your spine recline into what's behind it if it's being supported and if you're sitting with"
795.900,797.200," a free spine"
799.200,801.700," let's do a little little bit of a"
802.000,803.100," movement thing"
804.300,807.300," just rock an inch forward and an inch back"
808.700,809.700," but your own pace"
811.800,812.300," feeling"
813.800,815.800," that movement in your seat"
818.400,819.900," and in the length of the spine"
822.900,825.400," and as you're doing it let your jaw relaxed"
828.600,830.800," that your shoulders relaxed and your arms"
833.100,834.400," and come to rest in the middle"
840.800,843.500," and let's do a little bit side to side now"
845.800,847.200," an inch or two each way"
848.400,848.900," in a few"
850.100,853.100," if you're lying or reclining do your own version of this"
856.100,857.500," side to side"
860.500,861.600," helping ourselves"
863.100,864.500," get centered"
867.400,868.200," balanced"
870.000,870.900," cumming arrest"
871.300,871.800," in the middle"
881.500,882.100," checking the"
882.700,885.500," you know you're feeling the right place the right"
887.500,889.000," alignment of the spine"
892.200,893.800," one that allows you to relax"
901.900,904.000," relax the tongue relax the jaw"
907.400,908.500," relax the throat"
910.100,910.800," the shoulders"
913.100,913.700," the"
915.900,916.500," answer let them go"
920.200,920.800," let them go"
925.100,928.400," although we're upright is like with dangling"
929.700,931.000," dangling like a puppet"
936.500,937.900," and let that dangle"
939.300,941.300," spread into the rib cage"
943.700,945.200," so the whole rib cage"
947.400,948.100," could be like a"
948.500,951.200," an inverted basket hanging on a wall"
951.900,952.500," hanging from a"
953.100,954.300," raft or an old"
955.400,955.900," farmhouse"
964.600,965.300," barely soft"
966.900,967.200," feet"
967.700,968.300," warm"
973.300,974.200," just a little bit of"
974.700,975.600," pleasant pressure"
976.100,976.700," in the seat"
981.300,982.200," and legs also"
982.700,983.300," dangling"
984.000,985.700," whatever position they may be in just"
986.900,988.200," let them be completely"
989.600,990.000," released"
1019.100,1021.900," and you know noticed that now that we're in a"
1023.000,1024.500," relaxed stillness"
1026.300,1027.100," till it's kind of"
1029.200,1031.400," easier to start noticing"
1036.500,1038.800," noticing the feel of the body"
1043.300,1046.100," noticing the Field of body sensations"
1057.400,1058.400," and noticing"
1060.400,1060.900," the space"
1062.700,1065.400," all around in which sounds arise"
1073.000,1074.600," notice how that space"
1076.300,1079.800," system and after intrinsic immediate capacity"
1081.200,1083.800," to just welcome whatever sounds do arise"
1086.300,1087.900," just let's it let's them"
1088.900,1089.100," be"
1089.700,1091.100," let's them arise"
1137.400,1139.300," now just spend a little time"
1140.200,1143.700," getting to know the soundscape as it is right now for you"
1152.400,1153.800," typically there's some"
1154.900,1157.800," sort of short-term sounds that come and go"
1159.200,1159.900," as well as"
1160.300,1161.300," continuous"
1161.900,1162.500," sounds"
1163.800,1165.100," background sounds"
1265.800,1268.300," let's start to send the breadth"
1274.700,1278.400," to Almost like within the space of the soundscape"
1279.700,1281.000," within that space"
1281.800,1283.300," in which sounds are"
1284.800,1286.300," the same space"
1287.100,1288.100," kind of in the middle"
1289.400,1290.900," as this gentle"
1292.800,1294.600," rhythmic rise and fall"
1294.800,1295.400," of the breadth"
1317.800,1318.500," Burning"
1320.800,1322.300," letting the mind rest"
1325.000,1326.800," on the waves of the breath"
1362.500,1364.700," can you let sounds be present"
1366.100,1367.000," and breathe"
1367.300,1368.200," be present"
1387.400,1390.200," is there a way that we can sort of switch Gear"
1391.200,1392.200," to an awareness"
1393.800,1396.000," that very easily frehley"
1397.800,1400.500," can be aware of both sounds and breath"
1405.800,1408.700," for my sometimes be more one or more the other"
1410.200,1411.300," that's just fine"
1456.900,1458.000," then sing breathe"
1460.400,1461.200," sensing"
1462.300,1463.500," soundscape"
1466.100,1469.300," and also sensing the the body field"
1471.400,1473.000," cloud of general"
1474.200,1475.400," body sensations"
1484.800,1487.600," is there a way of resting in that cloud"
1510.700,1512.800," can you kind of inhabit"
1514.400,1515.100," the cloud"
1515.700,1518.000," field of body sensations"
1535.600,1537.500," actually in that cloud we're"
1538.400,1540.900," we're also able to be aware of the breath"
1542.800,1544.200," which is a body Sensation"
1545.400,1547.300," and of the soundscape"
1568.000,1569.200," it's really the"
1569.700,1570.800," cloud of all"
1571.800,1575.200," our outward world facing sense experience"
1579.300,1580.100," as we see"
1590.400,1591.000," sometimes"
1591.500,1594.500," site is there also if your eyes are open"
1596.700,1599.700," let the screen of sight being included"
1601.800,1602.700," in that"
1604.100,1606.400," outward field cloud"
1607.900,1610.200," of sensation of sense experience"
1629.600,1631.300," alright yourself rest here"
1638.400,1639.100,"what if"
1640.400,1641.100," it's okay"
1642.700,1643.400," to do less"
1645.100,1645.500," not more"
1659.300,1662.100," or if it's okay to go into a mode"
1663.700,1665.300," that's really just receptive"
1666.900,1667.700," receiving"
1685.700,1687.300," just for a little bit you know not"
1688.300,1690.200," sending not transmitting"
1691.500,1692.300," turn that off"
1696.400,1697.500," just receive it"
1705.900,1707.100," whatever experience"
1708.100,1712.100," wants to just just let it show itself receive"
1726.400,1728.200," it does something"
1729.400,1732.200," going on that you're not particularly keen on just"
1733.100,1734.600," can you just let it be the"
1737.300,1738.500," can you even let"
1738.800,1738.900," the"
1740.200,1741.700," not liking it also"
1742.400,1743.500," be present just"
1744.600,1745.400," receive that"
1746.000,1746.300," too"
1762.900,1764.800," this receptive mode"
1766.000,1766.200," is"
1766.800,1768.500," kind of impartial"
1770.700,1771.200," meaning"
1773.100,1774.400," it's very welcoming"
1778.600,1779.000," whatever"
1779.500,1780.800," it is come on in"
1806.000,1808.500," of course sometimes thoughts bubble up"

1813.300,1813.300," welcome"
1819.300,1820.000," notice that"
1820.500,1821.700," you know sometimes we're going"
1822.600,1824.600," caught up in them and go off and a little"
1825.000,1826.200," journey with the thoughts"
1827.200,1828.100," and then we come back"
1829.600,1831.900," and it's really not any kind of problem at all"
1833.700,1834.600," we just come back"
1837.200,1839.700," into resting here and receiving"
1842.400,1843.000," welcoming"
1846.200,1846.800," allowing"
1882.300,1883.300,"sometimes we might"
1883.900,1886.900," track some kind of emotional tone"
1889.500,1890.400," that too"
1893.300,1895.700," just let it be present"
1897.600,1899.300," let welcoming mode"
1900.900,1902.400," receiving mode"
1905.900,1906.900," give it a home"
1923.200,1925.100," if there's an emotional tone"
1926.600,1928.200," can you find this"
1928.400,1929.500," sort of signature"
1930.000,1930.400," in the"
1931.400,1932.700," summer in the torso"
1935.600,1937.400," some little trace of"
1938.600,1939.600," a Sensation"
1941.300,1943.500," in the diaphragm or the chest maybe"
1948.900,1950.900," come back into receiving"
1951.400,1951.700," mode"
1954.700,1956.800," and let receiving mode"

2022.000,2023.300," in this moment"
2042.800,2046.000," what if right now in the heart of this moment"
2048.300,2050.200," there's an okayness"
2059.700,2062.200," even a kind of basic goodness"

2218.200,2220.400," aware of a kind of wholeness"
2223.100,2224.500," and experience right now"
2229.900,2232.500," as if all of this the hearing"
2235.400,2236.900," any sense of sight"
2239.100,2240.500," body sensations"
2243.800,2245.800," feelings emotions sensations"

2251.100,2251.900," all of it"
2254.000,2255.400," forms a kind of"
2256.800,2258.100," single ho"
2262.900,2264.200," whatever one this"
2268.200,2269.300," a whole mess"
2274.400,2277.600," even though they are single nest"

2300.200,2300.600," well"
2345.900,2348.500," seems like the less we do"
2352.300,2354.300," the more that sense of"
2355.400,2356.100," wholeness"
2357.600,2358.500," singleness"
2360.600,2363.100," just stars to emerge by itself"
2366.300,2369.100," to Don't don't try to get anything like that"
2372.400,2374.000," just notice of any"
2375.200,2377.400," since the you need to do something"
2378.200,2378.800," comes up"
2380.400,2382.400," notice that that too"

2432.200,2432.500," the body"
2434.100,2436.700," feel totally free of course to do so"
2437.200,2438.400," just do it slowly"
2440.300,2441.700," gently mindfully"
2445.700,2447.700," just go a little bit longer here"
2450.900,2451.300," but"
2453.500,2454.800," they're not carefully"
2455.800,2458.500," rearrange if you need to to be comfortable"
2464.300,2466.600," again checking your juris"
2467.000,2467.100," Slack"
2482.900,2484.700," coming back into your own"
2485.800,2487.500," receiver mode"
2489.900,2491.700," receiving experience"

2534.000,2536.000," wholeness"
2544.400,2546.300," and just seeing what that's"
2586.700,2586.700," like"
2664.700,2667.200,"like this receiving mode"
2668.500,2668.800," so what"
2669.300,2670.400," a receive you"
2675.100,2676.600," that you be"
2677.700,2678.700," received"

2698.100,2699.700," all of your exper"
2703.100,2703.700," just now"
2818.300,2821.300,"uh if it feels right for you by all means"
2822.000,2825.100," carry on just keep gliding on in this"
2826.200,2828.800," sit floating drifting gliding on if that feels"
2830.900,2831.800," the right thing for you"
2832.200,2833.700," otherwise you know"
2834.400,2835.600," gently bringing"
2837.300,2837.400," some"
2838.500,2840.000," nice feeling movement"
2840.600,2841.500," back into your body"
2842.900,2843.800," whatever that might be"
2846.400,2847.600," opening the eyes"
2848.200,2849.100," or raising them"
2851.400,2853.900," and perhaps taking a deeper breath in"
2855.900,2856.500," an hour"
2856.900,2858.200," maybe stretching a little bit"
2859.500,2861.800," and we'll will go into a little bit of a break"
2863.100,2865.200," I think we better give us ourselves just long enough to"
2866.500,2869.000," get the proverbial cup of tea or whatever"
2870.100,2871.000," and resume"
2871.600,2873.000," reconvene"
2873.400,2873.500," in"
2874.600,2875.900," seven minutes at"
2877.100,2878.200," 55"
2879.300,2880.100," minutes past"
2880.800,2881.200," the hour"
2882.800,2883.000," so"
2883.800,2885.000," see you in just a moment"
2885.400,2886.600," thank you everybody very much"
2887.800,2888.000," the"
2888.400,2889.500," sitting together like this"
2891.800,2892.400," even a little bit"
2980.800,2983.200,"you"
2986.100,2989.500," are"
3035.500,3037.200," lift your"
3108.200,3110.200," you"
3200.500,3201.900,"okay hi"
3203.000,3204.600," and welcome back to everybody"
3206.300,3206.500," you know"
3207.300,3207.400," yeah yeah"
3210.500,3211.500," good sit"
3212.000,3212.200," and"
3214.300,3215.400," and a nice little"
3216.500,3218.900," break if you broke off from sitting right then"
3220.000,3222.400," and let's see what I'm"
3224.600,3225.200," let's see what"
3226.200,3227.700," what we can do now what I can"
3228.700,3229.400," what could I can offer"
3230.300,3231.500," in this subject of"
3232.700,3233.000," doing"
3233.800,3234.500," and undoing"
3235.200,3235.400," and"
3236.200,3237.200," factors of"
3237.600,3238.200," Awakening"
3238.800,3240.800," so just a couple of points to begin with"
3241.200,3243.200," one was the last time"
3244.200,3247.000," we actually went through a traditional list of seven"
3247.600,3249.100," factors of Awakening"
3250.200,3250.800," which"
3250.900,3251.800," in a way there"
3252.900,3255.000," all pointing those particular 7"
3255.300,3256.000," that was a"
3256.400,3257.000," mindfulness"
3262.100,3263.200," curiosity"
3264.000,3264.700," in practice"
3265.900,3266.100," and"
3266.800,3267.900," energy and sort of"
3268.800,3272.600," kind of determination in practice the third one fourth one"
3274.600,3275.100," delight"
3275.800,3276.600," meaning"
3277.600,3279.200," very positive feelings that"
3279.900,3282.100," and sensations that can come on in practice"
3282.700,3284.100," fifthly calm"
3284.400,3284.700," 6"
3285.700,3289.300," concentration or absorption or known as samadhi"
3289.700,3291.200," and seventh equanimity"
3292.400,3294.300," really really really"
3295.100,3295.500," open"
3296.400,3298.800," to whatever comes that's kind of what we were"
3299.700,3301.800," exploring today actually with the welcoming"
3302.500,3304.100," the receiving the nan"
3304.900,3307.100," the non judging non-discriminating"
3310.600,3312.500," receive mode welcome mode"
3312.900,3313.500," that's really"
3314.600,3315.200," kind of another"
3315.700,3316.000," term"
3316.400,3317.100," almost for"
3317.400,3318.100," equanimity"
3318.700,3319.800," just whatever comes"
3321.700,3323.200," and if I like it"
3324.100,3325.100," I don't try to grab it"
3326.100,3328.400," if I don't like it I don't try to push it away"
3329.600,3331.000," there's just receiving"
3333.200,3336.500," so really all seven of those"
3337.800,3340.500," kind of in a sense that they're just one really practice"
3341.600,3343.500," doing practice is a factor"
3343.900,3344.500," and it's probably"
3346.800,3349.300," as powerful of fact tool as"
3350.000,3350.700," there is"
3351.500,3351.800," actually"
3353.900,3357.200," you know these zen teacher Robert Aiken Roshe"
3358.100,3359.100," he's credited with this"
3359.700,3362.000," line that's become quite widely"
3362.600,3363.000," voted"
3365.700,3367.400," enlightenment is an accident"
3368.400,3370.800," practice makes us accident prone"
3372.400,3373.200," which is really"
3374.100,3376.800," very well put now in lighting it's a grand word"
3378.500,3381.100," Awakening I think is a slightly less ground wort"
3381.700,3383.100," possibly you know"
3384.500,3384.900," but it's"
3386.200,3388.700," because it might has lots of connotations of I don't know"
3389.400,3390.900," something so glorious"
3391.800,3397.700," and what with maybe it really is but still Awakening I like it more personally because it's"
3398.300,3401.400," it's really conveys this idea sort of waking up"
3402.100,3402.300," from"
3403.600,3406.200," an enchantment or waking up from a dream"
3406.700,3408.400," or waking up from a slumber"
3409.500,3411.600," you know that actually we can kind of"
3412.500,3413.700," we can wake up to"
3415.800,3416.200," aspects of"
3417.100,3417.700," our experience"
3418.800,3422.200," and what the whole of our experience is that we had not been"
3423.000,3425.600," aware of and so it really Awakening is a"
3426.400,3428.300," quite a good term I think in that regard"
3429.000,3429.300," but anyway"
3430.600,3433.000," all of that is practiced but what else"
3433.700,3434.900," what other factors"
3435.800,3438.200," if you know if we're practicing regularly"
3439.100,3440.500," great we've got sort of got that"
3440.800,3441.400," covered right"
3442.600,3444.800," I mean if we are it's very good to practice every day"
3445.300,3447.800," you'll have heard that I'm sure from other people"
3448.500,3450.800," but really it is there's something about"
3453.700,3456.100," minimum effective dose"
3456.900,3460.300," and you know when you've got the minimum of effective dose"
3460.900,3464.100," if you start to get just Inklings"
3464.700,3467.300," have a kind of thread of continuity"
3468.600,3469.300," of"
3470.500,3473.400," a just that little taste of a different kind of awareness"
3474.300,3475.300," however subtle that"
3477.000,3478.200," resurfaces"
3479.000,3479.900," through your day"
3480.800,3482.200," you know because of the"
3482.600,3484.900," the Anchor of a daily sit"
3485.100,3485.600," that you're doing"
3486.300,3486.700," I remember"
3490.700,3491.400," somehow when"
3492.400,3493.900," I got my dose right"
3495.000,3495.700," way back when"
3496.700,3499.700," 30 odd years ago or something I remember feeling like"
3504.000,3505.800," I put a tea bag in a"
3506.300,3506.700," in a"
3506.900,3507.500," in a mug of"
3508.100,3508.600," hot water"
3509.600,3510.000," and that"
3510.800,3511.100," tea"
3511.500,3513.600," sort of suffused the hot water"
3514.900,3515.100," and"
3517.300,3517.800," like what"
3518.500,3519.500," by analogy the"
3519.900,3520.500," 30 minutes"
3521.200,3524.100," I was sitting at that time I was sitting 30 minutes in the morning"
3525.300,3530.000," and somehow at that time that was the right dose because I could feel"
3531.100,3532.500," that my whole day"
3533.500,3535.600," is in effect my whole life at that time"
3536.600,3537.600," had that"
3538.200,3539.200," tea flavour"
3539.600,3540.500," of the tea bag"
3541.200,3543.100," of a daily 30 minutes it"
3543.800,3544.300," brand through"
3545.000,3545.800," it was subtle"
3546.200,3548.500," but it was there it's spread through my life"
3549.500,3549.600," so"
3550.300,3551.000," find your"
3552.400,3552.800," correct"
3553.200,3556.500," dose and you know changes like actually at that time"
3557.300,3558.300," brighter that I've been doing"
3559.000,3559.500," 20 minutes"
3560.000,3562.900," twice a day which was the stated dose for practice"
3563.900,3564.700," of the TM"
3565.600,3567.700," methodology transcendental meditation"
3569.500,3573.600," and then I you know five years on I switched from that to doing Zen"
3574.300,3575.500," which was much simpler"
3576.300,3580.800," and you know they didn't really insist on you know what what the"
3581.300,3583.400," what you should do I mean in terms of how much"
3584.200,3586.100," unlike TM which was like TM"
3586.500,3587.800," 20 minutes twice a day"
3588.300,3590.300," or don't bother kind of thing was there"
3590.600,3591.100," recipe"
3591.800,3592.500," but then was"
3593.000,3594.200," vague about it but"
3595.000,3598.700," somehow I think from somebody I picked up like well why don't you try"
3599.200,3603.600," 30 minutes once a day and so I was doing that and it was alright it was"
3604.800,3606.800," because it was enough to suffuse"
3607.600,3608.900," all be a subtly"
3609.400,3611.200," suffused it's flavour"
3611.800,3612.400," into my life"
3613.200,3615.600," and it was lovely actually to"
3616.400,3617.200," feel that flavour"
3618.200,3618.900," and to find the"
3619.700,3621.300," it didn't take that much"
3622.200,3625.000," you know it's supposed to say you look at it but"
3626.100,3626.600," 30 minutes"
3627.000,3627.500," once a day"
3628.700,3630.200," I didn't think was that much you know"
3630.600,3630.700," to"
3631.200,3632.000," to get such a"
3632.700,3633.600," tweet effect"
3635.100,3637.000," and but you know you you find your own"
3637.600,3637.900," minimum"
3638.500,3639.300," effective dose"
3640.700,3641.600," and stick with it"
3642.000,3643.000," through thick and thin"
3644.600,3645.500," through thick and thin"
3645.900,3646.900," why well because"
3647.700,3649.600," practice is actually"
3650.600,3651.300," that time"
3652.200,3653.100," of meditating"
3653.800,3655.000," is a time of not doing"
3656.600,3657.100," you know we"
3657.700,3662.100," as I was saying earlier we do the meditation but what do we do in the meditation"
3662.800,3663.800," basically we don't do"
3665.400,3665.900," you know and"
3666.500,3671.500," and especially if you if you like this sort of receive emojis to try it for a while you know"
3672.200,3674.100," and or it just comes on by itself"
3674.800,3677.200," but the bear Factor being still"
3679.200,3680.100," and quiet"
3681.200,3683.700," and not being engaged in our"
3684.400,3685.500," outward activities"
3686.800,3688.200," while being fully awake"
3690.200,3692.700," and yes if we're exhausted and need a nap"
3693.000,3695.300," we have a nap and count that it's okay if you"
3695.900,3698.100," that's what your meditation times crying out for"
3698.800,3700.100," you better let it happen you know"
3701.000,3701.500," a nap"
3701.900,3702.100," doesn't"
3702.600,3705.300," but the fact that we're not engaging"
3706.700,3707.400," in the"
3709.100,3713.500," you know the activities but the activities themselves are sort of part of a whole world view"
3713.800,3714.700," that we bought into"
3715.600,3716.700," and so they sort of"
3717.900,3719.600," they reinforce our"
3720.500,3723.100," our sense of how this world works"
3724.500,3725.900," which is fine"
3726.500,3727.000," but it"
3727.600,3729.200," prevents until we have that"
3729.900,3733.100," time of stillness we we don't have a chance"
3734.100,3734.200," to"
3735.800,3736.700," recognise"
3738.000,3739.400," the Greatest Gift of all"
3740.400,3741.100," which is that"
3741.900,3742.200," we are"
3743.200,3743.600," existing"
3745.700,3746.000," you know and"
3746.500,3747.400," meditation"
3748.800,3751.400," uh in a period of 100"
3751.500,3756.200," hundred thousand eighty-four thousand eighty four million different interpretations of what it is of course"
3756.900,3758.000," but some level is"
3758.300,3758.900," basically"
3760.000,3760.700," coming back"
3761.600,3762.800," to a recognition"
3763.800,3764.100," of the"
3764.500,3766.000," of the fact of existing"
3766.600,3767.200," at all"
3768.700,3770.500," and that that is the"
3771.900,3772.400," fundamental"
3773.800,3774.000," good"
3775.800,3775.900," you know"
3776.800,3777.100," um"
3777.800,3777.900," now"
3780.600,3780.900," okay"
3783.400,3783.900," so we've got"
3784.600,3785.000," practice"
3785.600,3785.800," and"
3786.800,3787.800," details- within that"
3788.800,3789.100," as"
3790.100,3791.400," a cluster of factors"
3791.800,3792.400," for Awakening"
3793.700,3794.600," and what is Awakening"
3795.300,3795.400," just"
3796.400,3797.600," a visit that a little bit"
3798.300,3799.500," um I wanted to"
3800.800,3804.000," enter that this question actually with the comment that somebody"
3804.800,3806.200," put in the chat last time"
3806.900,3808.500," that I thought was very insightful"
3810.000,3811.100," just near the end of it was about"
3814.600,3815.700," it was about a kind of"
3816.500,3817.900," I haven't got in front of you right now"
3818.400,3820.100," but it was a long Eliza like"
3821.500,3822.200," I've got this"
3823.500,3825.500," neurological sort of loop"
3826.200,3827.300," in grained that"
3828.200,3829.100," I need to"
3829.700,3830.800," do what I do"
3831.300,3832.800," in order to be worthy"
3833.900,3835.300," and if I don't do what I do"
3836.400,3837.600," I won't be worthy"
3838.200,3839.200," and I thought that was"
3840.000,3840.400," actually"
3841.000,3841.300," really"
3842.000,3844.100," true probably for a lot of us that"
3844.900,3845.400," we have"
3847.100,3848.500," our self-worth"
3849.200,3850.200," hide to"
3851.000,3851.200," our"
3852.400,3853.500," what productivity"
3854.400,3861.100," in various arenas of life you know whether it's of course work or might be family or might be"
3861.800,3867.100," you know relationship or it might be Sport or it might be a cluster of activities but"
3867.800,3868.600," my my sort of"
3869.000,3869.600," output"
3870.400,3871.500," in those zones"
3872.100,3872.500," is what"
3873.300,3874.100," justifies me"
3874.800,3876.900," or something like that so I can feel okay"
3877.700,3878.800," about me being me"
3879.600,3880.200," provided"
3880.700,3882.200," check check check check these things"
3883.000,3883.200," are"
3883.800,3884.600," adequate in"
3885.200,3886.500," output or productivity"
3887.700,3888.200," something like that"
3888.800,3890.600," now of course the flip side of that"
3891.400,3891.600," is"
3892.000,3892.300," the"
3892.900,3894.300," the disease of"
3894.800,3898.300," modern times but not just modern times I suspect the disease of"
3899.900,3903.500," I don't know maybe it's ever since we started having cities or something I don't know but"
3904.200,3905.200," being around a long time"
3905.800,3909.200," and it seems to be particularly pernicious that I think in"
3910.300,3911.700," western globalised"
3912.200,3912.700," culture"
3913.600,3914.800," which is unworthiness"
3916.300,3917.200," that if I don't"
3917.700,3919.800," keep measuring up in these ways"
3920.700,3921.900," I'm not worthy"
3922.600,3923.600," and unworthy"
3926.200,3927.100," it's really a"
3928.400,3931.300," when if you if you think of it sort of from the perspective of"
3932.000,3933.900," you know what we just been doing with sitting"
3934.800,3936.900," with in this welcoming mode"
3938.100,3939.700," and you apply that welcoming mode"
3940.400,3941.300," to an idea"
3941.900,3942.900," that somebody has"
3943.400,3946.400," that intrinsic is so many millions of us do that"
3946.900,3949.700," we're sort of intrinsically unworthy"
3952.200,3952.500," wow"
3954.000,3954.600," I mean isn't that"
3955.200,3958.200," you know sort of I mean like from the perspective of welcoming mode"
3959.600,3960.500," which welcomes everything"
3962.200,3963.400," for somebody to have"
3963.700,3966.500," to be carrying around this sense that they're intrinsically"
3967.000,3967.700," not good"
3968.800,3970.800," and they got to keep rushing around to prove"
3971.500,3972.500," or to generate"
3973.300,3973.700," sense"
3974.400,3976.200," that they are good enough"
3977.000,3977.300," just"
3978.100,3981.200," and if they stopped doing it they go back down to this unworthiness"
3982.300,3982.900," that's kind of"
3984.200,3986.400," pretty harsh and sad"
3987.400,3988.600," state of affairs"
3990.100,3993.800," my first therapist actually back in London in my mid-20s this group"
3994.100,3996.100," very interesting man Harvey Common"
3996.500,3997.200," but I mentioned before"
3997.800,4002.000," you know he had I remember that was telling him once about early on actually about how"
4002.600,4005.300," how good I felt while I was writing my first book"
4006.100,4007.000," which I had written when I was"
4008.400,4008.900," rather Young"
4009.800,4011.500," and and and you know I've been kind of"
4012.500,4013.200," pretty miserable"
4013.700,4017.800," ever since doing that actually a few years on when I started seeing Harvey him"
4018.300,4019.700," I guess I was 25 or so"
4020.400,4020.600," and"
4021.400,4022.400," and he said"
4023.100,4023.600," yeah that's"
4024.200,4026.400," that's good there's finally felt good"
4027.200,4027.500," but it's"
4028.000,4028.900," it's got a problem"
4029.700,4032.000," it was tied to performance"
4033.100,4035.200," in other words he was just putting his finger on"
4035.900,4036.900," then I felt"
4037.800,4040.400," okay- because of what I was doing"
4041.500,4041.800," you know"
4042.400,4046.800," and I mean he it was perhaps a little more complex because actually it was very"
4047.600,4050.800," fulfilling and enjoyable to be writing the writing the way I was then"
4051.400,4052.700," regardless of"
4054.000,4059.500," I mean there was a side to it that was fulfilling in and of itself but certainly there was another side also which is my"
4060.100,4063.300," it allowed me to feel good about myself that I was producing this stuff"
4065.100,4065.500," I mean there's a"
4066.300,4068.000," lot of more to the story"
4068.700,4069.200," was in"
4069.600,4073.000," source of intense misery that I didn't do anything about it for years"
4074.400,4074.400," but"
4075.100,4075.900," that's another story butt"
4076.800,4077.100," he was"
4077.900,4081.000," pointing to exactly this point do we generate our sense"
4083.400,4085.400," do we only allow ourselves to feel"
4085.900,4086.900," put worthy"
4087.700,4088.700," by virtue of what with"
4089.200,4090.000," accomplishing"
4096.100,4097.300," and and can you send"
4098.300,4100.200," the intrinsic sadness of that"
4102.700,4105.500," you know and so this thing of undoing"
4107.800,4108.300," it would be"
4108.900,4110.300," both undoing"
4111.200,4112.100," the kind of cognitive"
4113.600,4114.500," superstructure"
4115.000,4115.500," that says"
4116.900,4119.800," I'm not okay I'm not deserving"
4120.400,4121.500," of my own existence"
4122.000,4122.600," and as I'm"
4123.400,4124.800," proving that I'm worthy of it"
4125.000,4126.300," by doing X and Y"
4127.500,4128.000," and Z"
4128.500,4129.000," or Z"
4134.300,4135.100," how sad"
4135.800,4138.600," and then therefore in the context of practice once again"
4139.700,4140.700," the being still"
4143.700,4145.400," in a sense where"
4146.600,4147.900," if we're still in body"
4149.400,4150.000," and we're not"
4150.900,4152.100," actively you know"
4153.700,4154.600," piping or something"
4156.600,4158.100," and so our minds are also"
4159.900,4160.200," kind of"
4161.300,4162.000," encourage"
4163.200,4164.400," to not be active"
4165.000,4168.100," not be so active to start coming and also into their own"
4169.700,4170.900," version of stillness"
4171.800,4172.500," then we're not"
4173.300,4173.500," doing"
4174.700,4175.400," then when we're not"
4176.300,4179.300," engaging in the activity of proving"
4179.700,4182.500," proving that we're worthy by virtue of what we're doing"
4184.600,4185.400," we're just being"
4186.300,4187.500," and gradually gradually"
4188.300,4188.400," we"
4189.500,4194.400," settle I mean gradually over time over days and weeks and months and years and decades"
4195.000,4195.700," we settle"
4196.300,4197.300," we can settle"
4197.800,4198.500," more and more"
4199.000,4200.000," into this mode"
4200.500,4201.300," of just being"
4202.000,4202.900," just allowing"
4203.300,4204.100," just receiving"
4204.800,4205.800," just welcoming"
4206.900,4210.900," and it's not just like we do welcoming"
4211.700,4214.000," it's more like we fall back into"
4215.000,4215.600," welcoming"
4215.900,4216.400," in other words"
4217.300,4219.600," this is another kind of undoing that actually"
4220.400,4222.100," a sort of real welcoming"
4223.500,4224.700," the receiver mode"
4225.700,4225.800," you know"
4226.800,4228.000," we're not doing it"
4228.900,4229.800," it's already here"
4231.100,4231.700," it's like where"
4232.400,4233.400," this engaging"
4234.500,4237.200," the the we they me that we know"
4238.600,4243.500," that is engaging and doing and active and all the rest of it and worrying and fretting and"
4244.000,4245.800," planning and enjoying as well you know"
4246.200,4246.900," all of"
4247.300,4247.500," that where"
4247.900,4249.200," disengage from that"
4250.700,4251.400," putting it down"
4252.500,4253.400," letting it rest"
4254.400,4255.300," first of all like a"
4256.300,4257.100," cup on a Shelf"
4258.200,4258.700," then like a"
4259.800,4261.200," piece of moist clay"
4262.500,4265.900," on a Shelf in a cup made out of clay but it's coming more moist"
4266.700,4268.300," and then gradually more and more the clay"
4269.300,4270.700," becomes more and more moist"
4271.300,4273.000," and it's sort of losing its shape"
4273.500,4274.400," and it spreads out"
4274.900,4277.000," and so that what that was gets"
4278.500,4280.200," dissolved more and more"
4281.600,4282.100," and actually"
4283.100,4284.500," lo and behold we can still function"
4285.100,4285.600," weirdly"
4286.100,4286.500," maybe"
4287.500,4288.100," function better"
4288.500,4288.700," actually"
4289.200,4291.900," but anyway leaving that aside we're coming back into"
4293.000,4293.100," this"
4293.700,4295.100," pre-existing state"
4296.000,4296.100," that"
4297.000,4297.600," prior to"
4298.200,4298.800," the formation"
4299.600,4302.000," of the active one that we think we are"
4303.600,4304.400," prior to that"
4305.600,4306.000," there's this"
4307.200,4308.000," data being"
4309.300,4310.700," that is intrinsically allowing"
4311.200,4311.700," receiving"
4313.200,4313.500," welcome"
4315.400,4316.900," so we're kind of it's like we"
4317.800,4320.600," we don't make that we fall back into"
4321.500,4323.300," it we dissolve back into"
4324.500,4329.600," it and actually in spite of my little metaphor about the cup and the clay and the booze or whatever it became"
4329.900,4330.600," don't worry about that"
4330.900,4331.700," we can pick up"
4332.800,4333.800," the tool of"
4334.400,4335.300," Strategic itself"
4336.200,4336.700," any time"
4337.200,4337.600," it's okay"
4338.300,4338.600," it's not"
4339.100,4339.900," it's never going to be"
4341.000,4342.000," unavailable to us"
4342.500,4344.000," now they might be a times actually but"
4344.400,4345.100," it's not a problem"
4346.100,4346.700," it's not a problem"
4347.200,4347.500," to have"
4348.100,4349.100," detachment from that"
4349.400,4350.500," disengagement from that"
4350.800,4351.800," because we can pick it up"
4352.700,4353.600," pretty much any time"
4355.700,4356.400," that we want to"
4357.300,4358.600," we may also find"
4359.200,4360.100," that remarkably"
4361.000,4361.800," we don't need it"
4362.400,4362.700," the way"
4363.100,4364.900," it wants us to think we need it"
4365.200,4365.400," so"
4366.100,4367.200," ding ding ding ding ding"
4367.900,4371.900," we're talking about what is Awakening is all to do with that sense of self"
4375.600,4379.200," now I actually just this next step in this little"
4380.200,4382.000," argument is this that"
4382.900,4383.100," what"
4383.900,4385.300," that therapist was talking about"
4386.000,4386.600," to me was"
4387.900,4389.200," could you be okay"
4390.100,4391.800," in your own self"
4392.600,4393.500," regardless"
4394.200,4395.000," of any performance"
4397.200,4398.400," regardless of"
4399.200,4403.800," what you're presenting to other people that you hope they will recognise in a firm"
4404.300,4405.400," and then groove of you"
4405.800,4407.000," so you can approve of yourself"
4407.900,4408.500," did you just"
4409.100,4410.800," let all that go and be"
4411.800,4413.500," sort of worthy unto yourself"
4414.800,4414.800," so"
4416.800,4418.100," this is actually a piece of"
4418.800,4420.800," CBT cognitive behaviour therapy"
4421.600,4422.000," to have"
4423.100,4426.200," universal self acceptance you essay"
4426.800,4428.400," universal self acceptance"
4429.200,4430.100," and they say"
4430.600,4430.700," that"
4431.300,4432.100," there are two"
4432.600,4434.300," forms of that one form is"
4435.100,4437.300," because I exist I have set myself"
4437.900,4439.200," just by virtue of the fact"
4439.700,4440.200," that in some"
4441.700,4444.700," sense the universe except me or I wouldn't be here at all"
4446.500,4447.000," I too"
4447.400,4448.200," can accept myself"
4449.000,4451.800," just by virtue of the fact that I exist because that's one"
4452.600,4454.200," form which is an improvement on"
4455.000,4455.400," I must"
4455.800,4456.600," earn my"
4457.400,4458.000," wordiness"
4459.200,4460.400," but the second form"
4460.900,4463.300," of self acceptance that they would talk about in"
4463.600,4466.000," CBT cognitive behaviour therapy"
4467.000,4467.800," was not that"
4468.100,4473.800," it was like they actually there was a one of the pioneers of CBT that I've talked about before Albert Ellis"
4474.700,4479.200," he started to think called rebt which was a kind of precursor to"
4480.100,4481.700," a lot of CBT"
4483.000,4483.700," he's to say"
4484.500,4484.800," and more"
4485.400,4486.500," elegant solution"
4487.400,4488.800," is to say that you know"
4489.400,4492.300," there is no single me anyway"
4493.100,4497.000," I'm far too complex there's loads a little eyes that pop up"
4497.600,4499.500," in lots of different ways and there isn't one"
4500.100,4500.700," Collective"
4501.600,4501.800," to the"
4502.300,4503.400," whole single"
4504.100,4504.700," me"
4505.600,4507.100," and even if there were"
4508.800,4511.300," who would there be that can actually"
4512.200,4513.100," appraise it"
4513.400,4515.200," and decide how much it's worth"
4516.700,4517.000," you know"
4517.400,4518.200," obviously that"
4518.700,4519.100," idea"
4519.500,4521.400," well I don't know about obviously but likely"
4522.700,4522.800," it"
4523.400,4523.600," has"
4524.100,4525.100," religious Origins"
4525.600,4527.900," that there is some ultimate judge who can say"
4528.700,4529.400," that's all"
4529.900,4534.600," is worth you know five and that one's worth 10 and that was minus five and that's"
4535.100,4536.100," minus 33"
4537.000,4538.500," you know with his scales or whatever"
4539.200,4539.300," and"
4540.300,4540.700," actually"
4541.200,4546.400," do we really believe that you know that and anyway well some of us might but"
4547.200,4547.600," some of us"
4549.800,4551.200," even those of us who might"
4551.700,4551.900," probably"
4552.900,4553.100," don't"
4553.600,4558.300," it really want to believe that it's quite a sort of punitive and it's one way or the other way you know"
4558.900,4560.100," utterly Damned or"
4560.500,4560.900," forever"
4561.400,4561.600," or"
4562.300,4564.300," utterly blessed forever based on"
4564.900,4568.400," one little hair's breadth of a difference if you hadn't done that you know"
4569.400,4572.200," it'd be good and if you haven't had done that you'd be bad or whatever"
4572.900,4574.900," but actually we are like that with ourselves"
4575.400,4575.800," but you know"
4577.400,4577.800," can we just"
4579.100,4581.100," the Albert Ellis as can you just"
4581.400,4582.300," drop the whole thing"
4582.800,4584.100," you know just don't have"
4586.500,4590.300," realising fact that you don't have this single core"
4590.900,4591.200," that is"
4591.700,4593.400," absolutely judge all"
4599.800,4601.300," well that's getting quite close"
4602.200,4604.500," actually to what we're talking about with The Awakening"
4605.800,4606.100," because"
4609.000,4610.500," the insight"
4612.400,4618.500," I think in all cases where this you know Awakening thing is sort of Taken seriously in a traditional School"
4619.300,4621.500," and and meaning bye"
4622.900,4623.100," it this"
4623.900,4624.200," particular"
4625.400,4627.600," meditative slash contemplative"
4627.900,4628.200," slash"
4628.900,4629.800," existential"
4631.200,4632.000," Discovery"
4632.900,4634.700," is it is the discovery"
4636.300,4636.500," that"
4637.500,4638.300," my sense"
4639.000,4639.800," of me"
4642.000,4642.600," hasn't"
4643.400,4643.700," been"
4644.100,4644.400," what"
4644.900,4645.000," it"
4645.500,4646.100," presented itself"
4647.100,4647.600," as being"
4650.600,4651.900," it's actually been"
4652.900,4653.900," no more than"
4655.700,4657.200," a set of stories"
4658.000,4659.800," a set of thoughts in the mind"
4660.700,4661.400," and perhaps"
4662.000,4662.200," some"
4662.700,4663.500," accompanying"
4664.600,4665.500," body sensations"
4666.700,4666.800," but"
4667.700,4669.000," the heart of it really"
4669.600,4670.700," is the thinking"
4671.900,4673.700," that says I am me"
4674.700,4675.100," with this"
4676.600,4678.900," thread of time that I'm Strong on"
4680.200,4681.600," um that my whole life"
4682.700,4683.100," has been"
4684.400,4686.400," going looking backward and looking forward"
4687.400,4689.200," that there's the single Strand"
4690.100,4691.300," that is called My Life"
4693.400,4695.300," that stretches Through Time across time"
4696.600,4696.800," and"
4698.400,4701.100," it's who I've always been and always will be until I die"
4702.400,4702.600," and"
4703.600,4704.400," that there is"
4704.900,4705.100," you know"
4705.700,4706.200," a person"
4706.700,4710.100," a single fixed solid nugget called me"
4712.400,4714.600," that like a bead travels along that thread"
4715.700,4716.100," of time"
4717.500,4717.900," actually"
4718.700,4719.300," all of that"
4720.000,4720.400," is just"
4721.500,4721.900," thinking"
4722.700,4723.600," it's just thinking"
4724.600,4725.900," and if thinking"
4726.800,4727.300," stops"
4730.600,4730.900," that"
4733.900,4734.400," whole"
4736.200,4737.900," little cluster of ideas"
4738.600,4738.900," also"
4739.900,4740.200," stops"
4742.500,4744.700," now one Theory is that quite often"
4745.400,4748.400," it that's the case actually we're not thinking about self"
4749.400,4752.200," we're in grossed in an activity we're absorbed in activity"
4752.700,4754.400," there may not be a lot of thinking going on"
4755.500,4756.700," but every time"
4758.200,4760.100," we come back into sort of awareness"
4760.600,4761.400," of being here and now"
4762.400,4762.500," we"
4763.000,4766.600," quickly bring up this sense of self again this thought of self"
4767.200,4769.300," and when it comes up it brings with it"
4770.100,4770.300," the"
4770.800,4772.800," projection forward and back with Through Time"
4773.400,4774.700," instead of intrinsically"
4775.800,4777.600," part of the thinking around self that it"
4778.500,4778.900," it"
4780.200,4781.100," the whole little"
4782.200,4783.700," cluster of what self is"
4784.100,4784.800," hops back up"
4785.400,4786.900," we just quickly check in with it yes"
4787.500,4789.400," I'm still not I'm still that as I thought"
4790.000,4790.400," and you know"
4791.000,4793.000," and it's just continually"
4794.200,4797.700," episodically but very frequently reinforces itself"
4798.600,4799.100," but actually"
4800.400,4801.800," there are gaps in it"
4802.100,4803.400," but we paper the move"
4804.800,4805.800," we don't notice them"
4806.200,4807.600," and when we start meditating"
4809.300,4813.400," and get more tuned in to our actual experience in any moment"
4814.200,4814.700," we start"
4816.500,4816.900," perhaps"
4817.800,4818.400," noticing"
4819.400,4819.900," gaps"
4820.200,4820.800," in the sense"
4821.600,4822.100," of self"
4822.800,4825.300," and it may not seem to be very significant"
4825.600,4826.400," major seem like"
4826.800,4828.300," ah that's lovely and quiet"
4829.700,4829.900," but"
4831.200,4835.700," and that's great of course but there will probably be sooner or later at some point"
4836.500,4836.900," so I"
4837.300,4838.200," what wait a minute"
4839.500,4839.900," wait a minute"
4840.800,4841.800," I I suddenly"
4842.400,4843.100," had this gap"
4844.000,4845.200," when there was a gap in me"
4846.300,4848.300," there was a gap when I wasn't"
4850.900,4852.800," and actually that is"
4853.700,4854.800," an insight"
4856.400,4856.900," that is"
4858.000,4860.700," it may be strong or weak or glimpse or Glimmer or"
4861.400,4862.100," powerful you know"
4862.700,4865.300," but it's a glimpse that I am not"
4866.100,4867.800," what I had imputed"
4869.000,4869.500," there isn't"
4870.700,4871.300," a thing"
4872.200,4873.200," that these thoughts"
4874.600,4877.900," refer to this the thoughts of self seem to be referring"
4878.500,4879.500," to an actual"
4880.100,4880.300," thing"
4880.900,4882.400," but actually that only"
4882.900,4883.500," the thoughts"
4885.500,4886.200," to a minute like"
4886.700,4887.700," we assume"
4888.400,4889.900," we think herself and we assume"
4890.800,4894.900," there is a self and that's why I'm thinking of it because it's really there"
4895.400,4896.900," but it's actually only"
4897.600,4897.900," thinking"
4903.500,4903.800," okay"
4904.300,4904.700," um"
4905.800,4906.400," now why does this"
4908.000,4908.900," why should this be"
4912.500,4914.200," why should it matter actually so what"
4914.700,4916.700," think of yourself turning yourself why does it matter"
4917.700,4919.100," well here's why"
4919.500,4921.900," here's why I'm going to invoke this um"
4924.000,4928.300," computer scientists slash philosopher's first slash bit of a kind of a"
4929.800,4931.300," pretty cool to physicists I'm not sure"
4931.900,4934.900," Bernardo castrop I don't know some of you will know of him"
4935.700,4937.000," some of you might might well not"
4937.700,4940.500," but he's quite an interesting guy you can you can Google him"
4941.200,4945.900," because he's a you know he's a double PhD actually he's a clever guy he's been"
4946.600,4947.900," studying he did"
4949.300,4953.100," philosophy and ontology first his first PhD then his second PhD was all"
4953.600,4953.900," actually"
4955.200,4957.300," computer engineering you know it's a"
4959.000,4960.000," I think it's quite significant"
4962.600,4962.800," yeah"
4963.600,4964.600," cyber"
4965.000,4966.600," cyber dude cyber Guy"
4967.200,4967.500," and"
4968.300,4968.900," and he"
4970.400,4972.900," his his view is that I'm"
4979.300,4980.600," I'm just trying to think of the"
4980.900,4983.300," best way to just bring this in that basically"
4984.400,4985.100," the world"
4985.800,4987.100," as We experience it"
4988.100,4989.600," is a kind of mental model"
4991.100,4995.100," so now just to back up a moment when I say mental model"
4996.200,4997.900," it could mean two things it could mean"
4998.700,5000.800," that I have a kind of model in my mind"
5002.100,5002.400," and"
5003.600,5006.200," it's my own mental version"
5007.100,5008.700," of the world that I experienced out there"
5009.500,5010.100," so I could have a"
5011.100,5014.300," mental model of the actual world"
5015.100,5015.400," so in other words"
5016.000,5018.700," you know I walked through a street there's trees this cars"
5019.400,5020.000," neighbourhood"
5021.300,5021.700," fine"
5022.400,5023.700," and then I create"
5024.300,5025.000," in my mind"
5026.500,5029.500," my own mental model of the street with the cars the trees"
5030.000,5030.200," you know"
5030.800,5031.300," our house"
5032.300,5033.500," that's fine in it's still like"
5034.100,5035.300," essentially I can imagine"
5036.000,5036.600," that street"
5037.400,5038.500," so that will be one"
5039.400,5041.700," way of understanding this idea of a mental model"
5042.700,5044.100," but there's a much more radical"
5044.500,5046.000," way of understanding it"
5046.200,5046.700," which is this"
5047.600,5047.700," the"
5048.200,5051.100," actual world that I experienced"
5052.200,5054.500," you know the room I'm in with the walls and the window"
5055.200,5057.500," you know and and all the street outside"
5058.300,5059.500," with the trees and the cars"
5060.600,5061.000," that"
5061.500,5064.200," actual experience of the street"
5064.700,5066.400," is a mental model"
5067.700,5068.600," you see what I mean rather than"
5071.000,5071.400," rather than"
5072.600,5075.000," having a mental model of the actual Street"
5075.600,5077.100," the actual Street"
5078.100,5079.000," is a mental model"
5080.300,5082.400," now this is what Bernardo Castro is saying I think"
5083.600,5086.100," I hope I've got that right and I hope it's sort of clear"
5086.600,5086.700," that"
5087.300,5090.000," you know you you sit down at the dining table"
5091.200,5091.600," actually"
5092.400,5094.400," the experience of sitting down at the time"
5094.900,5095.500," dining table"
5096.100,5097.300," is a mental model"
5099.100,5103.700," it's a kind of there's another guy and I'll set who wrote this great book called being you"
5104.200,5106.800," he says something rather similar he's a neuroscientist he said"
5107.700,5112.100," you know the world we experience the actual experience of the world"
5112.600,5114.100," is it kind of hallucination"
5115.000,5117.600," and we construct it in our minds"
5118.400,5120.100," and sense experience"
5121.000,5122.700," hearing seeing touching"
5123.300,5124.200," corrects"
5125.000,5125.400," the model"
5126.100,5127.600," that we've already constructed"
5128.400,5131.900," so I don't know if I'm conveying this is quite radical it means that"
5134.100,5135.400," instead of"
5138.400,5139.000," because we"
5139.600,5142.800," we assumed don't we that we we are a self"
5144.300,5145.000," moving through"
5145.900,5146.500," the world"
5148.000,5150.500," but actually this view is saying"
5151.800,5155.500," the world that we appear to be moving through is"
5156.400,5157.500," a simulation"
5157.900,5158.700," of the mind"
5159.700,5161.100," and Bernardo Castro says that"
5161.800,5162.100," basically"
5163.400,5165.800," this helps I mean that the point of this"
5167.900,5170.100," experience of the world is to kind of give us"
5171.200,5174.200," levers to sort of control it to navigate it"
5174.900,5175.500," there is like"
5176.200,5177.600," you know you it's like"
5178.800,5182.100," you know you feel the floor as you walk across it you see it"
5183.200,5183.800," you feel it"
5184.300,5185.500," hear your footsteps"
5186.200,5187.000," all of that"
5187.800,5188.100," is"
5188.400,5190.400," sort of the navigation equipment"
5191.200,5192.500," for navigating"
5193.500,5195.100," the experience we call life"
5195.900,5197.800," but we kind of don't know"
5198.500,5201.600," what it's actually what the actual stuff is"
5202.300,5204.000," and his view is that it's all"
5204.700,5205.100," consciousness"
5206.400,5211.600," so let's I mean maybe yes maybe no who knows it maybe it doesn't matter"
5212.200,5213.000," from the point of view"
5213.600,5214.500," of Awakening"
5218.100,5220.200," it it is to awaken"
5222.600,5223.200," it it"
5225.600,5229.800," so it just give me a moment let's just sit for a second I want to make sure I say this right"
5232.700,5234.400," actually I probably can't say it right"
5235.900,5237.200," not going to worry about that so much"
5237.900,5239.600," and let's just sit anyway just for a moment"
5249.800,5251.200," yeah I just want to add one thing"
5252.700,5253.400," in this"
5255.000,5263.100," simulation this mental construction of what the world is that we're making all the time without realising it everything but just sort of in the world"
5264.000,5265.200," we're also"
5266.400,5267.200," adding to that"
5267.600,5269.000," mental model is also"
5270.400,5270.900," the sensei"
5271.200,5271.900," of their being"
5272.200,5272.700," and me"
5273.400,5275.000," that is part of that one"
5276.200,5276.900," but actually"
5277.500,5278.400," that sense of me"
5279.000,5280.000," is simply"
5280.600,5281.100," a part of"
5282.400,5282.500," the"
5284.500,5286.300," hallucination the simulation"
5286.600,5287.600," the mental construction"
5288.300,5288.900," of the world"
5291.000,5292.700," and it's critical"
5294.600,5296.900," when we see through the sense"
5297.800,5299.400," of self when we see through"
5300.600,5301.300," the sensei"
5302.100,5303.400," that there's a real self"
5304.200,5305.300," that all the thinking about self"
5306.000,5307.600," is referencing when we suddenly realise"
5308.400,5309.500," know there's only thinking"
5310.500,5311.000," of self"
5312.500,5313.000," and actually"
5314.600,5315.300," what if they're just"
5316.000,5316.600," isn't one"
5317.000,5319.100," it's suddenly hits us you know what if"
5320.000,5323.000," they're really isn't a me that way I'd always thought there was"
5324.300,5324.600," it"
5325.000,5325.400," um"
5326.500,5330.300," it's a it's what it's it's such an important Turning Point because"
5332.000,5332.200," it"
5334.800,5335.000," it"
5335.400,5335.900," does"
5336.200,5338.800," something amazing to our"
5339.500,5340.400," relationship"
5341.900,5342.100," with"
5343.000,5343.700," everything else"
5346.500,5348.000," it's like it's as if"
5348.500,5352.000," we suddenly discover with out that sense of self"
5353.200,5353.400," being"
5354.000,5355.900," the agent and filter and"
5357.200,5358.900," Noah of all of this with that"
5360.600,5361.200," dropped away"
5364.300,5365.500," we become"
5368.200,5368.600," the world"
5371.200,5371.300," I mean"
5372.200,5373.200," I don't know if I'm putting this"
5373.800,5375.300," clearly it's as if"
5375.900,5377.100," there is no longer"
5377.600,5378.500," any distinction"
5379.700,5379.900," between"
5382.600,5387.300," well it's hard to put the worst if I say there's no longer in this distinction between me and the world"
5387.900,5392.200," it suggests there's still a me but it's not like that with me god"
5393.200,5393.800," I am"
5394.500,5394.800," the world"
5395.500,5397.100," but that I is not"
5399.500,5399.900," the me"
5400.400,5402.300," but I'm accustomed to thinking I am"
5404.600,5405.400," it's as if that"
5405.900,5407.700," me drops away and all there is"
5409.500,5410.400," is all of this"
5410.700,5410.800," and"
5411.600,5414.400," somehow we just completely intimate with all of it"
5415.800,5417.700," and that's where this sense of one"
5418.300,5418.700," nest"
5419.100,5419.500," comes from"
5421.600,5424.300," because there's just no separation left"
5426.300,5426.500," the"
5427.500,5428.500," the mental model"
5429.400,5430.000," has lost"
5430.700,5431.700," critical peace"
5432.900,5433.100," and"
5435.500,5439.500," or with a critical piece of it that helped to generate"
5440.100,5440.900," this idea that"
5441.400,5444.400," you know I am me and the world's out there and"
5444.900,5447.800," and everybody else is out there all other things are out there and"
5448.600,5451.500," and even the experiences within the body I kind of out there"
5452.600,5454.100," with reference to the me"
5454.800,5456.800," you know I can experience a pain in the knee"
5457.400,5458.400," but when that me"
5459.500,5462.400," has been seen through when it's dropped away"
5463.400,5464.500," it's just one"
5466.800,5469.600," blowing Flux of phenomena and"
5470.300,5472.800," they know and sometimes of course we can see through that as well"
5473.800,5474.000," and"
5475.100,5476.400," we are just"
5477.000,5478.800," what there is no"
5479.100,5479.800," separation"
5480.900,5481.700," and it's"
5482.400,5482.600," it's"
5483.500,5484.200," incredibly"
5485.700,5486.600," beautiful and"
5487.500,5488.200," very"
5491.800,5492.300," talk about"
5495.200,5495.900," a feeling"
5496.300,5496.600," for that"
5497.500,5499.500," condition of habituated"
5500.000,5501.000," unworthiness"
5502.500,5505.800," because I well oh my Are My Oh My academic that could that could"
5506.300,5508.800," be impossible to be unworthy"
5509.500,5509.900," in this"
5510.700,5511.800," new view"
5517.100,5518.900," so now I'm about to stop"
5519.800,5524.700," but in terms of factors what's the factor we're talking about him well we've been talking about"
5525.200,5527.600," you know of course the practice the stillness the quiet"
5528.300,5534.400," but actually on some level I can't help feeling and I'd like to pursue this further than the next session is not"
5535.200,5536.500," the real Factor"
5537.300,5537.400," here"
5538.200,5540.400," is actually reality itself"
5541.300,5541.700," it sort of"
5542.300,5544.700," the way things really are"
5545.400,5546.200," is the real"
5546.600,5547.200," Factor"
5548.200,5549.300," because actually"
5550.900,5552.600," I think it's fair to say I mean"
5554.700,5557.500," anytime somebody has a glimpse of this kind of thing"
5560.300,5561.100," it comes with"
5561.700,5565.100," this so-called no ethic quality a quality of knowing"
5566.100,5567.900," that kind of know yet just"
5568.300,5568.800," no"
5569.800,5571.600," that this is more"
5572.900,5573.200," true"
5574.300,5574.600," than"
5575.000,5576.200," the prior version"
5577.000,5577.200," that"
5578.200,5579.300," it just is"
5580.100,5581.000," unmistakable"
5581.700,5582.600," this is more real"
5583.500,5584.200," I have just"
5584.600,5585.100," peeled off"
5585.800,5586.900," and lair of the UN"
5591.100,5592.600," you know half the shallot"
5592.900,5593.900," just came off you know"
5594.600,5595.300," I see"
5596.000,5599.700," you know and then you keep peeling off and and and and there's nothing left"
5600.300,5601.800," it's not like you get to the heart of"
5603.000,5608.500," thing the heart as a there's a core nugget down here which is what we were waiting for no you just keep peeling off"
5609.100,5609.700," and there's nothing"
5610.400,5611.300," that's that's actually"
5611.900,5614.100," how we can get to this taste of the"
5614.600,5615.100," absolute"
5615.700,5616.800," gone nest"
5617.300,5619.000," just nothing and everything"
5619.800,5620.300," somehow"
5621.000,5622.000," generating itself"
5622.500,5623.400," into experience"
5625.100,5626.100," okay I'm gonna"
5628.000,5628.700," hit pause"
5629.400,5630.500," take a quick look at the chat"
5631.200,5631.800," and invite"
5632.500,5635.000," questions and comments and discussion"
5635.700,5637.500," so pleased either in chat or"
5637.900,5638.000," with"
5640.200,5640.700," with the"
5641.400,5642.100," hand raise"
5643.100,5645.100," okay let me just see wow okay there's a lot"
5645.900,5647.200," let me have a quick quick look"
5648.800,5654.400," at some of the most therapists have been helping me focus on that word in it's attached to okay- great great great great great great"
5655.100,5657.900," so have time to speak directly I was searching condition to do perform"
5659.300,5665.800," okay thank you the conditions alliance system were born into that there's not authentic being I kind of agree"
5666.700,5671.900," very comforting and I agree it's nice to be reminded there's nobody deciding judging whether he was a person's worthy or deserving"
5672.500,5679.600," or even statically the same person exactly exactly and not statically the same person you've been up to this point is that Nick"
5681.400,5688.700," yeah I think what's weird is that those of us who have never even been religious still have an online that they access to some grandpoint"
5689.200,5690.900," system exactly point system"
5691.500,5692.700," I think it is probably from"
5693.100,5697.900," Judea Christian ideologic I mean folks you know I've got this new book actually about to come out"
5698.600,5699.800," all the original love"
5700.200,5701.700," which is kind of about this is saying"
5702.800,5703.400," hey we've got it"
5704.000,5708.800," you know we can't kind of like I want to say I hope it's not rude to me because sort of grow up"
5709.300,5709.400," from this"
5710.100,5712.000," entrenched idea of original sin"
5712.400,5715.400," and find reality in which there is"
5715.900,5716.800," original love"
5717.300,5718.000," automatically"
5718.800,5720.500," and then I argue that"
5721.200,5724.300," I mean you'll know this those of you have been doing original love for a while but"
5725.100,5725.900," the same"
5726.600,5728.000," sort of blessedness and"
5728.600,5729.600," belovedness and"
5730.100,5732.000," that is in Awakening"
5732.700,5733.400," shows up"
5734.100,5734.300," in"
5735.400,5737.300," other areas of practice so we don't"
5738.800,5741.800," you know we can get it in our mindfulness we can get it in our"
5742.500,5745.500," sense of connectedness that we develop and we can get in and"
5745.900,5746.700," low states and"
5747.300,5749.200," we don't have to wait for some"
5749.800,5751.000," you know radical"
5752.400,5755.900," discovery of Awakening in order to taste the"
5756.500,5760.400," the the the what it gives us the the self"
5763.400,5763.400,"um"
5765.200,5765.900," the self"
5766.800,5771.100," acceptance the self love that USA universal self acceptance"
5771.300,5772.200," we can get that"
5773.500,5775.800," prior to having a mind-blowing Awakening"
5776.200,5779.300," okay so let me just see setting to ding ding"
5780.700,5784.800," do you think most people can actually live in exist in that place of Awakened mind no self"
5785.100,5786.600," seeing it all construction for me"
5787.200,5791.000," it was so overwhelmingly profound I couldn't imagine stabilizing into day-to-day life"
5791.600,5792.700," that's a good point"
5794.500,5794.600," I mean"
5797.400,5798.800," then has a view on this"
5799.300,5804.500," I you know one of the reasons I think I was drawn to zen and kind of like Zen"
5804.900,5805.500," was it it was very"
5806.300,5810.200," articulate and kind of explicit about this process of Awakening"
5812.000,5812.100," and"
5812.800,5813.500," and it had"
5814.000,5817.900," I mean among it you know many aspects of course of it but one was this"
5819.300,5821.400," the circle ox herding pictures which"
5822.400,5823.100," map out"
5824.000,5824.800," process of"
5825.400,5826.500," you know practicing"
5828.300,5829.600," kind of settling in"
5830.800,5832.600," getting a flash of a glimpse of this"
5833.500,5834.800," no selfness"
5835.400,5835.700," and then"
5837.400,5838.100," precisely"
5838.600,5839.800," a process then of kind of"
5841.200,5845.100," stabilizing that which might also mean getting it more deeply actually"
5845.900,5850.000," and then I've just coming back to Ordinary life they say"
5850.500,5852.300," in the Zen view you actually"
5853.700,5856.800," I mean it seems so counterintuitive but they kind of want"
5857.300,5859.500," the practice to to get it"
5860.300,5862.200," and then get it really thoroughly"
5862.400,5865.400," so it goes all through your experience all the way through"
5866.600,5867.900," and then forget about it"
5868.800,5869.100," actually"
5869.700,5872.600," they actually want us to reach a point where we don't have to be"
5873.100,5876.900," trying to stay aware of no self or all one or whatever or"
5877.300,5878.200," it's all a construction"
5878.900,5880.600," when we don't need to be aware of that"
5880.800,5881.800," but just living normally"
5883.100,5883.700," that we've kind of"
5884.700,5886.400," you know there's a famous little Zen"
5887.000,5889.000," I don't know if it's really a poem but it says you know"
5890.400,5891.200," before then"
5891.800,5894.200," a mountain is a mountain a river is a river"
5894.900,5896.000," during Zen"
5896.500,5898.200," a mountain is not a mountain"
5898.500,5899.400," a river is not"
5899.800,5900.200," a river"
5901.000,5901.900," after then"
5902.700,5904.500," a mountain is again amount in"
5905.000,5906.100," the river is again"
5906.600,5907.100," a river"
5909.200,5910.300," that somehow the"
5911.000,5912.200," the end point"
5912.700,5914.100," can't be just"
5915.000,5916.100," in a vast"
5917.500,5918.000," bliss"
5919.100,5921.700," of nothingness you know no self no world"
5922.300,5924.100," I've seen through the entire thing"
5928.500,5929.600," bound this freedom"
5931.600,5932.400," nothing to be done"
5934.300,5938.700," which is the reality at the heart of each and every moment by the way I believe"
5939.500,5940.700," based on own experience you know"
5941.700,5942.500," but that's not"
5943.200,5943.900," an Endpoint"
5944.500,5947.900," because you know we are in this life we are in this world we are"
5948.300,5953.000," what it may be like you know what a Cohen rosier 20th century master he's to say"
5953.700,5956.700," yeah this world may all be a dream"
5958.100,5961.300," but we must still work to make it a happy dream"
5963.100,5966.000," and I think in the end you know Russia"
5966.700,5967.900," what do I know that ends no"
5968.400,5969.100," at some point"
5970.200,5971.800," I think it becomes clear that"
5972.800,5974.400," you don't need to make a distinction"
5975.000,5975.300," between"
5976.400,5978.900," the the construction of world and self"
5979.400,5979.600," and"
5980.300,5980.500," the"
5981.000,5981.200," sort of"
5982.300,5984.800," what we've glimpse to the the deeper reality"
5985.700,5986.200," that actually"
5987.000,5987.800," they're not two things"
5988.900,5989.400," and then we just"
5991.400,5992.200," make a cup of tea"
5993.300,5994.400," you know hop on the zoom"
5996.000,5996.500," go to work"
5997.200,5998.100," etc"
5998.500,6000.900," let's see but then Awakened how can you live in operate in the world"
6001.600,6002.000," yeah well"
6005.500,6007.600," first of all you know you're fine actually"
6008.300,6009.300," can put weighted for God"
6011.700,6013.200," actually you'll find that"
6014.000,6015.500," it's a weird thing I mean I remember"
6016.600,6018.600," when I had one particular blow"
6019.600,6020.700," over Awakening when I was"
6022.400,6025.700," this would have been about 20 years ago actually not it wasn't it wasn't"
6026.000,6026.400," really the"
6026.800,6028.400," the most profound most"
6030.600,6031.500," impactful but"
6032.200,6032.900," still kind of"
6033.300,6034.600," powerful and marvelous"
6035.000,6035.500," and I thought"
6037.000,6038.800," how am I going to function I was"
6039.500,6040.600," busy as a writer and a"
6041.800,6043.700," poetry fellow at that time and"
6044.400,6046.800," a college in Oxford Oxford Brookes University actually"
6047.700,6048.200," like"
6048.500,6051.300," I I can't go and sort of talk to someone"
6052.400,6052.500," but"
6053.000,6056.700," I can't I can't speak really that I words are"
6057.100,6059.600," pointless you know and thinking is pointless is"
6060.200,6061.500," I was just freed and"
6062.600,6063.100," but you know I"
6063.700,6065.700," went up to the college or my bike and"
6067.100,6069.300," it all went fine it's just sort of"
6069.700,6072.200," it does it happens it just happens this"
6072.700,6073.600," you know because in a way"
6074.300,6076.700," the world is doing it all anyway trees are"
6077.300,6078.200," being trees and"
6079.000,6080.300," cars are being cars and"
6081.100,6081.300," you know"
6082.000,6082.900," people are being people"
6085.100,6086.900," it's happening that's happening anyway"
6088.300,6089.500," alright and it's actually"
6090.100,6090.500," all"
6091.100,6093.800," empty and we can examine that word and more deeply"
6094.200,6094.700," anyway"
6095.100,6096.100," but it's all still happening"
6096.500,6096.900," anyway"
6097.800,6098.300," so actually"
6099.700,6101.300," it's already doing it all anyway"
6103.500,6103.700," okay"
6105.200,6105.900," Joel hi"
6106.900,6107.600," can you unmute"
6109.600,6113.600," fit feel free to raise a hand by the way anybody wants to speak and ask something"
6114.500,6114.800," can you hear me"
6117.300,6117.900," all right so"
6119.200,6120.000," thanks Henry"
6120.500,6120.900," my"
6122.200,6126.500," little backstory for this question is that basically like I found you through the waking up app"
6127.000,6128.300," and then I read your book"
6128.800,6132.200," and I was like oh this is it this is what I want like Awakening and enlightenment"
6132.800,6133.500," and it sounds like"
6136.200,6139.100," in this in tradition they have a way like you joined this like"
6139.600,6140.500," you joined the same guy"
6141.400,6141.700," and you"
6142.700,6145.900," eventually get the CEO owns and then like you have your teacher"
6146.600,6150.000," and so I was kind of like ready to sign up until I realised that there wasn't"
6150.400,6150.700," like"
6151.600,6153.200," a samples and lineage"
6154.000,6155.500," sangre in My City right"
6157.200,6157.700," and so"
6158.600,6160.700," I guess where this has gotten me too is"
6161.600,6163.200," a little bit of a question of like"
6163.900,6165.700," am I doing what I'm supposed to be doing like"
6166.900,6167.400," I have"
6167.800,6170.100," your app and I joined these classes and"
6170.600,6172.500," I still listen to stuff in the waking up app"
6173.200,6178.100," but I'm trying to figure out like do I need to find a local community or do I need to find a teacher"
6179.000,6180.100," for one-on-one teaching"
6181.800,6182.500," to get there"
6183.300,6184.400," or is this going to be"
6185.500,6188.600," or maybe what I'm doing well at work but will it take 30 years or something"
6189.700,6195.000," and you know I I know all the stuff of like you shouldn't be striving and don't obsess over the pursuit of"
6195.800,6197.400," Awakening or enlightenment but"
6198.500,6202.000," maybe this is like a question everyone has or maybe they have their answer but"
6202.400,6203.700," it's just kind of my open-ended"
6204.200,6205.900," am I doing it right Henry should I just"
6207.100,6211.800," keep doing what I'm doing or should I keep weighing options of like do I need to change something about my practice"
6212.900,6213.600," okay great"
6214.000,6215.100," so yeah very"
6215.700,6220.200," fine question Joe thank you I would say we'll football by the way which city you in"
6221.000,6221.600," I'm an Austin"
6222.400,6224.200," okay Austin Texas yeah"
6224.700,6227.000," yeah that's not so far actually from Santa Fe"
6230.900,6231.100," you know"
6232.300,6234.000," the the Bassline"
6234.600,6235.900," is to be sitting every day"
6236.300,6236.800," that's the"
6241.900,6243.200," that's the non-negotiable"
6244.300,6244.500," part"
6245.200,6247.900," sit every day for your chosen length of time"
6248.600,6249.700," and by the way the app is"
6250.200,6250.900," I'm not sure of the"
6251.200,6256.100," brought it out yet maybe they have this got 20 10 or 20 or 30 minit options now"
6256.900,6258.600," that's it as well as the time as you can"
6259.800,6260.400," you know just"
6261.200,6263.100," sit silent it the only length of time as well"
6263.800,6263.800," but"
6265.000,6267.200," make sure you do that daily sit"
6267.800,6269.900," that's that's just the non-negotiable"
6270.700,6271.600," part then yeah"
6272.500,6273.200," you reference"
6273.400,6276.000," two other of the so-called traditional three"
6276.600,6277.200," treasures"
6277.400,6277.800," one is"
6278.400,6282.900," basically the daily sitting this is an interpreting a bit I called Buddha dharma Sanger"
6283.400,6283.900," Buddha"
6285.100,6285.400," you can"
6286.200,6289.900," you know I take it I mean doing what the Buddha did I meditating"
6290.700,6293.400," alright that was the key path for him meditating"
6294.000,6295.400," so Buddha meditate"
6296.000,6296.400," every day"
6296.900,6297.400," secondly"
6298.200,6300.400," dharma that means receiving some guidance"
6300.900,6304.400," now that's the one that has man is has it changed in the last"
6306.400,6308.600," 340 years I mean you know that it"
6309.100,6310.900," used to be if you want to guidance"
6311.500,6312.300," you had to travel"
6312.900,6313.000," to"
6313.800,6315.100," perhaps somewhere really remote"
6315.600,6318.700," you know some temple on a mountain you know monastery or something you know"
6319.400,6320.700," and so you had to sort of"
6321.200,6323.100," have a profound up he will in your life"
6323.500,6323.700," you know"
6324.500,6324.900," then"
6325.600,6327.300," actually I'm sorry it's not in the last few decades"
6328.700,6329.900," in zen's history"
6331.000,6334.100," it began as basically monastic practice"
6335.000,6335.200," but"
6336.100,6336.400," some"
6336.700,6338.200," early teachers I mean we're talking"
6338.900,6340.700," 121300 years ago"
6341.500,6342.100," started having"
6346.100,6347.900," non monastic students"
6348.600,6350.300," to merge them farmer"
6350.700,6351.500," course he can do this"
6352.200,6352.700," you know so"
6354.000,6355.700," the idea that it could be brought into"
6356.400,6357.800," an ordinary life in the world"
6360.200,6360.700," is ancient"
6361.900,6362.600," totally can"
6363.500,6364.400," and then get hits"
6364.800,6365.500," of guidance"
6366.100,6366.600," you might be"
6367.800,6368.300," a letter"
6369.500,6370.400," it might be some"
6372.000,6375.300," text that have been vinted because they you know printing started"
6375.800,6378.400," insanely early in China you know way back in"
6379.300,6382.300," thousand years ago and more than thousand years ago they started having printing"
6383.700,6384.900," printing and pastor you know"
6386.000,6387.600," it came from China I guess you know"
6391.000,6391.200," but"
6392.100,6396.100," and then for community sang the 3rd of these so-called three treasures"
6396.700,6396.900," that's"
6399.500,6400.900," that's again also"
6401.700,6407.400," being kind of revolutionized at the moment different lamb in this this Gathering here"
6408.100,6409.200," is it's Sanger"
6410.000,6412.700," the guy that had a practice together is the heart of Sanger"
6413.300,6413.900," you know and"
6415.400,6417.600," you you could definitely find"
6418.300,6419.900," supplemental stuff"
6420.500,6425.100," you know you could find a group of Austin will for sure have groups I think I even know of"
6426.700,6428.400," trying to remember now"
6428.900,6432.600," I think kind of isang group in Austin you know but you don't need zen you could"
6432.900,6435.100," find an insight Center or you know you just whatever"
6435.900,6438.000," place you can go and meditate the feels congenial"
6438.400,6440.200," with others physically in the room with you"
6441.000,6444.700," or you know you you could come now and then we're starting to have"
6445.200,6445.800," retreats"
6446.300,6447.300," you could you know you could"
6448.000,6451.200," if you can win the away to one of them you could you can do that you know"
6452.600,6453.000," but you know"
6454.400,6455.800," there is a path where"
6456.100,6458.400," you know you you you you have"
6460.200,6461.200," you listen to guidance"
6461.900,6462.500," when you want it"
6463.500,6466.200," you on your on your phone you know your app"
6466.900,6467.100," you"
6468.000,6470.400," you come to a live Gathering when you want to"
6472.000,6474.700," you you construct you can you know you can make it"
6475.000,6475.700," your own way"
6476.200,6477.500," and at some point you might think"
6478.500,6486.100," wow I really want to connect with a teacher you know may only be a one-off but I would just want I want one session with a teacher just to go over some points"
6487.100,6488.700," and you can do that online that's"
6489.400,6491.500," I still meet now and then with my"
6492.200,6493.200," Japanese master"
6493.500,6495.000," you know occasion it's in person but"
6495.700,6498.600," more more often it's a little zoom gathering"
6499.100,6500.400," or zoom meeting one on one"
6501.200,6501.700," you know um"
6502.600,6505.300," so it's it's very workable in"
6507.300,6510.000," in many different forms and you just you just find"
6511.000,6514.700," what if feel is the right next step and you try it"
6515.200,6515.300," you know"
6517.100,6519.700," maybe yeah no I don't want that whatever that was"
6520.500,6522.200," so keep but still you keep sitting"
6522.800,6524.400," still your key you know hearing"
6524.800,6528.200," they're so much material on on the internet you know that you can"
6529.000,6530.800," buy and that's very helpful and"
6531.800,6535.200," no longer is it all have to be sort of cloaked in"
6537.100,6540.800," the higher attic mysteries of one particular lineage you know"
6542.000,6542.100," there's"
6543.300,6547.400," multiple approaches you know from the totally secular"
6549.200,6550.200," science-based"
6550.800,6552.900," and"
6554.500,6556.600," still acknowledging the value of practice though"
6556.900,6557.800," you know two"
6558.500,6560.200," very entrenched"
6560.500,6564.000," lineages with their own metaphysics and their own world views you know"
6564.600,6565.600," across the board you know"
6567.700,6568.300," it's healthy"
6568.900,6571.100," actually they have lots of different approaches that are"
6571.400,6571.900," available"
6572.300,6572.400," because"
6574.600,6576.600," we all might need something a little bit different you know"
6578.800,6579.000," and"
6582.400,6583.000," either way"
6583.700,6587.000," the reality that we're talking about is getting better known"
6587.200,6589.300," which from my point of is the most valuable thing"
6590.400,6591.200," as somebody who was"
6591.700,6592.600," clobbered by it"
6592.900,6597.400," early in life with absolutely no idea what it was and no idea where to turn"
6598.800,6601.600," to find any kind of guidance or support or anything in it"
6602.800,6605.000," okay anybody else want to raise a hand"
6606.400,6608.000," but I'm still going to look at the"
6608.700,6609.300," chat well"
6612.400,6612.700," this is"
6614.800,6615.300," okay yeah"
6615.800,6617.400," Francisco please go ahead"
6620.000,6622.000," and re thank you for your class"
6622.900,6623.900," I wanted to ask you"
6625.500,6626.700," you are a writer"
6627.800,6628.900," um do you feel"
6629.600,6631.700," like this glimpse of Awakening"
6632.100,6633.200," our similar"
6633.700,6635.900," of the glimpse you feel when you are maybe"
6637.100,6638.400," in some kind of art"
6639.000,6639.400," you"
6640.200,6640.800," writing or"
6641.400,6643.400," maybe to another artist could be"
6644.000,6644.800," another field"
6647.800,6648.700," I believe when we"
6649.400,6649.700," we are"
6650.500,6653.800," maybe developing in some kind of art maybe writing"
6654.400,6655.300," in my case"
6657.200,6658.300," something is we feel like"
6659.200,6660.500," something similar"
6661.000,6662.000," of what you're saying"
6662.600,6663.900," in the glimpse of Awakening"
6664.700,6667.300," and I don't know if I personally I personally"
6667.900,6669.500," felt that with my meditation"
6670.400,6670.900," but I do"
6671.600,6672.900," feel like I have been"
6673.800,6676.500," dancing that since I was a child when I write"
6677.100,6677.400," sometimes"
6678.200,6678.400," it's like"
6680.000,6680.000," so"
6680.700,6682.800," I'm really curious about if"
6683.800,6685.000," there is the same thing"
6685.600,6685.900," I don't know"
6686.300,6688.300," I don't know if I'm asking this right that"
6689.400,6689.900," that's it"
6690.900,6695.100," thank you for this good that's a great question and I'm really happy to hear that you you get glimmers and"
6696.000,6697.400," tastes of something similar"
6697.700,6700.200," when you're in your writing practice that's lovely to hear"
6700.800,6705.000," here's here's my take on it and actually again I write about this in the in the new book"
6706.800,6709.200," there's a thing called Flo States"
6709.700,6712.700," that are well known in psychology and when we get"
6714.100,6719.500," engaged deeply engaged in an activity and it could be writing it could be running it could be"
6720.600,6722.900," surfing it could be painting it could be"
6723.400,6724.600," playing music it could be"
6725.800,6730.500," writing a report it could be all manner of things it could be work meetings it can be"
6731.400,6739.400," a football team can collectively get into a kind of flow state where they buy each other out without using words they just know what the other"
6740.100,6741.200," person's about to do and"
6741.500,6741.600," you know"
6742.100,6744.600," there's there's lots of ways of getting into flow States"
6745.200,6745.400," and"
6745.800,6746.400," according to"
6747.000,6748.200," some of the literature"
6748.700,6749.500," they have"
6750.100,6754.900," certain characteristics that are rather light Awakening like they can be really effortless"
6756.000,6759.100," some of the performing very well but it's effortless"
6759.700,6760.300," no effort"
6760.800,6762.100," time can disappear"
6763.200,6763.500," we're just"
6764.000,6766.400," just no no no sense of time"
6767.300,6771.200," they can be deeply fulfilling we feel very sort of"
6772.400,6778.500," richly fulfilled and connected you know and they can also be selfless that we have"
6779.200,6780.100," a censor self"
6781.000,6782.000," isn't present"
6782.600,6783.700," and so all of that"
6783.900,6785.800," is quite like Awakening now"
6786.400,6788.500," I argue in my book that"
6790.300,6793.000," the new book I'm talking about the original love but is that"
6794.000,6795.600," all of that is fantastic"
6796.800,6798.000," the difference between"
6799.300,6800.400," being in a flow state"
6800.900,6801.000," and"
6804.200,6804.600," by the way"
6806.100,6807.500," it can be very blurry"
6808.000,6809.500," this distinction I'm making so"
6810.200,6811.500," and sometimes it's definitely"
6812.600,6813.600," a flow state can be"
6814.700,6817.800," on one side of this line of Awakening or it could be in the other side"
6818.200,6819.500," not necessarily Awakening"
6820.100,6823.000," but the the thing is in Awakening"
6823.800,6825.200," is we we don't"
6825.900,6829.300," it's not just that the self is quiet"
6830.300,6831.400," we see it"
6831.700,6833.000," and we see right through it"
6834.600,6835.300," we see"
6836.100,6837.900," that the census of has never been"
6839.000,6839.800," what we thought it was"
6840.700,6844.400," so it's not just that the self is quiet which is lovely"
6844.900,6846.700," is lovely for it to be part because we're much more"
6848.200,6850.100," present you know richly present"
6851.400,6853.200," but sometimes we can actually"
6853.900,6855.200," see the census self"
6855.500,6855.600," and"
6856.100,6856.600," see"
6858.400,6859.000," it's not"
6859.300,6860.800," what it appeared to be"
6861.400,6862.300," it's never"
6863.200,6863.500," actually"
6864.500,6864.900," been here"
6866.300,6867.300," and that is this"
6868.400,6869.400," enormous"
6869.800,6870.300," relief"
6871.400,6873.800," and it's sort of applies to the whole of our life"
6875.000,6875.100," so"
6876.100,6876.700," I would say"
6879.100,6879.700," and by the way"
6880.200,6883.400," this is not like absolute you know they could of course be"
6883.800,6885.600," you can be writing and suddenly"
6886.400,6887.200," sense of self"
6887.500,6892.700," you just see it was never what it seemed to be you could just see that while writing or you can see"
6894.600,6895.400," this hand"
6896.300,6899.700," moving across a page or maybe a typing these fingers on a keyboard"
6903.400,6904.800," that part of a vast"
6905.700,6906.300," reality"
6906.900,6908.100," one vast reality"
6909.600,6911.500," their appearing"
6912.200,6913.800," in a vast reality"
6914.500,6915.800," and this vast reality"
6916.900,6917.200," is"
6918.400,6920.200," what I really be"
6920.500,6921.700," what this life"
6922.100,6923.300," has really been"
6923.700,6924.400," all along"
6924.600,6928.000," I mean that could you know awaken it can happen in any context"
6929.000,6929.500," you know I"
6930.200,6933.800," I've written about it in my other book and I in this new book I write about as well like"
6934.300,6935.500," you know somebody might be just"
6936.200,6937.000," getting into bed"
6937.800,6938.100," boom"
6938.500,6940.000," it hits or there might be"
6941.400,6942.700," bringing the shopping in"
6943.200,6943.800," from the car"
6944.500,6944.800," boom"
6945.400,6946.400," nobody's walking here"
6947.000,6948.200," no bags are shopping you know"
6949.300,6949.600," or this"
6950.300,6952.500," carrots sticking out of the top of the motor shopping"
6953.100,6954.200," is the whole universe"
6955.900,6956.800," you know so it's it"
6958.800,6961.600," Awakening is unconditional it shows up"
6962.300,6964.200," any way time it wants to"
6964.600,6964.700," you know"
6967.400,6973.400," so anyway that's a little bit thank you for lovely question no let me just see to get it"
6974.300,6974.600," um"
6977.200,6979.700," yes we've got Mary Frances hi"
6987.400,6987.700," dude"
6988.600,6989.800," yes I'm hearing you"
6990.700,6993.000," well oh this is this is"
6993.900,6998.200," great what what we're talking about today is absolutely great"
6998.900,7003.400," you know also like probably 70% of Us"
7004.200,7005.700," I found you on"
7006.400,7008.400," Sam Harris's waking up a.m."
7008.900,7009.200," and"
7010.400,7011.200," you woke me up"
7012.400,7016.500," totally I mean I listened to everything on that app during the pandemic"
7017.200,7020.300," and there were about three of you that just made me"
7021.700,7022.500," a say"
7022.900,7024.500," this is a spiritual journey"

7027.000,7028.400," and want to do it"
7029.500,7031.700," and want to do it with a kind of"
7032.300,7034.900," it seemed to me now I might be making this up"
7035.500,7038.800," but it seemed to me that you had the insight"
7039.400,7042.000," about those of us who live in the marketplace"
7042.600,7045.300," and that you're insight was we"

7052.900,7053.600," for years"
7054.300,7056.800," in order to become enlighten"

7070.100,7070.700," and that"
7071.700,7073.700," and that yes if you're a seeker"

7095.500,7098.800," and and that I I guess what I'm saying is"
7100.100,7101.100," your work"
7102.100,7103.000," has given me"
7103.600,7106.600," permission to have my own spiritual life"
7107.300,7109.600," it have my questions"
