3.700,4.100,"great"
5.000,5.300," well"
6.900,9.700," I'm actually a little bit sort of flabbergasted"
10.100,11.800," when we thought of doing"
13.200,14.300," I say we"
14.900,15.500," Jeremy"
15.700,15.800," Who"
16.600,18.500," the program manager back in Santa Fe"
19.000,20.200," and I thought of"
20.900,22.900," doing you know some kind of live"
23.300,24.200," in person"
25.000,26.400," I think they call it IRL"
28.100,28.700," in real life"
29.100,30.400," I didn't know that until the other day"
30.900,31.500," but events"
32.000,32.600," here in London"
33.600,34.600," you know it's just a sort of"
35.100,36.400," will of a whisper of an idea"
37.400,39.500," and then we thought we had okay let's try it and maybe"
40.500,43.500," you know it doesn't people or two doesn't people might come"
44.100,46.800," and instead it's it's so many people all of you"
47.400,47.800," have made"
48.600,49.600," the gap in your"
50.000,51.500," in your in your Diaries and calendars"
52.300,53.300," some of you have travels"
54.600,57.100," you know well at least I think you have from"
57.500,58.700," it looks like it only lists"
59.800,60.200," parts"
60.900,61.100," like"
62.100,67.600," the Norway and Amsterdam and even a few from the US who assume I hope we're over here anyway"
68.100,68.400," and"
69.300,74.100," but welcome welcome all of you what an extraordinary and wonderful thing that we get to gather"
74.800,76.000," in a place like this"
79.700,84.200," I mean the moment I walked in I was I was really I really felt it this is"
84.900,87.900," and I think this is a slice out of a church by the looks of"
88.500,90.500," it anyway it's part of my"
91.700,95.200," choose if not physically literally just the cut a bit out of"
95.500,97.400," it given us this based on meditation"
98.200,99.200," but it's a lovely place"
100.100,101.000," and it's a lovely day"
101.500,103.400," and it's one of the most beautiful squares in London"
104.500,105.400," and here we are"
107.400,108.200," to do"
110.000,112.100," to do as little as"
114.400,114.700," literally"
115.200,116.100," that's the objective"
117.000,117.700," it's the stock"
118.200,118.400," doing"
119.600,119.900," anything"
122.900,124.000," that's what we gather"
124.900,125.000," to do"
126.000,126.100," it's"
126.500,127.200," that simple"
127.900,128.600," but not always"
129.200,129.600," so easy"
130.600,131.400," but before we"
132.500,134.700," before we get into that too much I want to say"
135.600,137.500," various thanks right off the back now"
138.400,140.300," here now your chino has been a"
140.800,143.300," an absolutely incredible help to make it happen"
145.800,146.800," and many many ways"

160.800,162.500," half dozen years or so of"
163.300,163.400," the"
164.600,166.100," so-called oxford's end group"
166.500,167.700," operating in London"
168.300,169.700," which it does as well as Oxford"
171.600,171.700," and"
172.100,177.900," which I haven't but I never had a chance to come here because I used to sit back in the day when I was sitting more regularly with it"
178.200,179.900," the same group that here"
182.100,182.700," meet in the"
185.500,186.500," agonal chamber"
187.200,188.400," right at the top of the tower"
189.000,189.500," instantly"
191.600,193.500," that was a that was a thing"
193.900,194.500," that's exactly"

230.500,231.600," Christian"
232.500,233.400," meditation"
233.800,234.000," group"
234.600,235.200," so that bringing"
237.200,237.600," their"
238.900,240.600," like it's the reigniting"
241.800,241.900," that"
242.400,244.600," part of the Christian tradition but"
247.000,247.100," is"
247.800,248.400," is that okay"
249.200,249.800," we're good yeah"
250.100,250.400," but"
251.500,253.500," you know we're very quiet for long"
253.700,254.500," time the contemplative"
255.600,256.300," side of me"
257.200,257.600," and"
258.500,259.300," there's a nice"
260.200,261.000," comfortable fit"
261.900,262.400," that we bringing"
264.300,265.800," not exactly sure what this is but"
266.400,268.000," is it's a good place for me"
268.600,271.200," it's a mix of then and some of the Passenger"
273.100,273.800," the bit of everything"
274.500,275.000," poetry"
276.200,277.200," general dark"
278.800,280.100," dharma meaning teaching"
281.000,281.400," but also"
283.700,283.800," the"
286.600,288.300," well what I want to say it reality"
288.800,289.600," the reality"
290.100,291.000," of truth of the things"
291.500,292.000," the truth"
293.300,294.900," but all things are exactly as they are"
295.800,298.900," and also the truth that just under the surface"
299.400,300.100," that Appearances"
301.500,302.200," but is also in"
304.000,304.700," and that truth"
305.200,305.400," with the"
307.200,308.500," maybe a small team"
309.000,309.600," a bit safer"
310.300,310.400," that"
312.200,312.400," truth"
313.900,314.100," is"
315.300,315.400," the"
316.300,317.200," best thing"
319.000,319.200," we could"
320.600,321.800," it's the best thing there is"
322.500,322.500," what"
324.400,325.300," and it's all ways"
326.100,326.300," here"
329.000,331.100," I think there's human being personally I"
332.000,333.200," this is to come back"
335.200,335.700," it's not a"
336.700,337.100," it's here"
337.900,340.700," and it is a part because we don't wreck"
342.700,343.700," as often as we might"
344.400,345.800," and it's so easy"
347.100,347.700," that's a simple"
348.600,349.300," but somehow"
349.700,350.900," we still need"
351.300,351.600," to do it"
352.300,356.800," we don't automatically do we have a kind of evolutionary wiring"
357.700,358.800," that pushes us in"
359.300,361.800," by the directions mostly away from"
362.400,364.100," the way we're gazing in the world"
365.200,365.900," around us"
366.600,367.000," in a way"
367.600,369.900," that we think will bring us the piece we must"
370.400,371.100," most Young"
371.800,372.200," Thing"
373.900,378.000," because we think if we can just get the world to behave the way we want it to"
378.800,379.600," we'll be ok"
380.600,381.400," I mean I'd say"
382.500,384.000," they'll still it's a very Common"
384.500,384.700," human"
385.800,386.400," habit"
387.000,388.500," and we can get vary"
389.900,391.900," convinced that quite upset about"
393.100,395.600," we can be quite harmful in the process of trying to"
396.400,396.700," sometimes"
397.400,401.900," we don't recognise it but sometimes we do but we can get off with all of us have the best"
402.900,404.400," to get quite harmful in a way"
404.900,407.000," to make the world Co"
408.900,409.900," world meaning"
410.700,412.400," everything in the world including other people"
413.800,413.900," but"
414.300,414.700," actually"
416.600,417.500," there's a really"
417.900,418.300," different"
418.800,418.900," what"
423.800,425.200," really difficult thing"
426.600,426.800," and"
429.400,430.000," I'm not going to"
432.600,433.900," much about it right now"
434.700,436.300," because we all know it"
436.600,439.300," it if some degree we've all tasted it at times"
439.800,440.400," but somehow"
441.100,441.500," everything"
442.400,443.300," it's spittle"
443.600,447.200," for the many things that manifestly not"
448.700,449.000," some"
449.900,450.500," will take"
451.200,452.000," times"
456.000,456.300," just"
457.000,457.100," well"
458.100,458.400," okay"
460.500,463.300," and we might think we would receive our supplement those times"
463.800,466.300," but I think not I think we weren't"
466.800,467.500," seeing this"
468.900,470.400," we were doing that opposite"
470.900,471.500," that's when"
472.000,472.800," we're close"
473.700,475.400," to the actual reality"
475.700,477.400," of this state"
478.500,479.100," called lion"
480.200,480.800," which we don't"
482.000,483.600," go on except in heaven"
484.000,484.900," I'm going to pause"
485.600,486.000," and read"
486.200,486.900," all of"
487.500,487.700," okay"
488.300,488.600," pause"
492.600,493.000," actually"
493.900,494.300," my thanks"
494.800,495.700," so let me know"
498.200,499.200," see what else would on that"
502.800,503.300," yes"
503.700,504.800," yes yes yes yes yes yes"
505.300,506.500," I mean the amazing thing"
507.000,507.300," so"
508.600,508.900," actually"
509.800,510.000," well"
510.600,512.100," I only started doing"
514.500,514.900," time"
516.200,516.400," since"
516.900,517.600," 20"
518.300,520.700," 20 March the 15th 2020 this is the third"
521.900,523.400," but I've been involved in a"
524.300,525.500," you know an IRL"
526.400,530.600," code teaching I don't know if that's the right word but sharing or would have to do gather"
531.900,534.500," so it's amazing actually to be able to"
536.400,536.800," and I think"
538.000,540.200," safely don't really have to worry too much like that"
545.300,546.100," so it's worth just"
547.200,547.500," taking"
548.100,548.400," note"
548.800,549.200," of that"
550.700,551.300," a little Thang"
553.200,554.000," you know hearts"
555.500,555.800," To Be"
556.400,557.700," amongst others"
558.700,559.300," lie"
559.500,560.200," warm body"
561.700,562.100," also"
564.100,568.500," engaged in the Marvelous see nothing at all"
576.000,577.800," yeah we'll get into some"
578.000,579.000," meditation now"
582.300,585.600," got a feeling there's a little bit of housekeeping that just want to say actually yeah"
586.000,586.100," we"
588.200,588.500," brings"
589.100,590.100," I think best to just"
591.200,591.600," quietly"
593.200,593.900," up if you need"
595.100,597.500," fluid adjustment of any kind of drinks as well"
598.000,598.400," rather than"
599.400,601.600," having a dedicated break when everybody"
602.600,603.500," just go when you need to"
604.300,604.400," and"
605.800,606.000," I mean"
607.400,607.700," coffee"
611.100,611.400," cookies"
613.200,614.600," and but go"
615.400,617.300," all you have to do is go mind"
618.200,619.300," if you work at me"
620.600,621.100," in other words"
622.000,622.400," go"
625.100,625.900," sense slower"
627.300,627.400," than"
628.100,629.200," you might naturally"
630.100,630.300," but"
631.300,632.000," you'll be my"
632.900,633.400," move"
634.400,635.700," that you won't be serve anyone"
636.500,638.100," if you do it doesn't"
639.300,639.900," we're all just"
640.600,641.500," basking in"
642.200,643.400," nothing so it's all time"
645.800,647.200," pizza housekeeping is"
649.600,651.000," I've really liked"
651.400,653.200," the I really like it"
654.200,655.800," it's like if I really like people"
656.800,658.400," to be people things might sound"
658.900,660.600," strange but I like people to be able"
662.100,662.600," and that"
664.700,665.500," and that's basic"
667.100,669.900," and this basic at the back and there's a little bit of space at the side"
671.000,672.600," and I think that's about it but"
673.700,673.800," it's a"
674.700,675.100," thing to do"
676.400,676.700," often"
677.200,678.100," we've been-- rushing"
678.900,680.100," without knowing we've been-- rushing"
680.800,681.300," for days"
681.700,682.500," weeks per month"
683.200,683.700," possibly"
684.500,684.800," a year"
687.900,690.000," and we come to a Day Like This"
691.100,691.300," which"
693.100,693.600," declared"
694.100,694.700," app time"
695.500,696.900," but actually"
697.400,698.400," when we stop"
700.100,701.500," when the body becomes still"
703.000,703.800," the mind"
705.600,709.400," will in time follow it but it may not be immediately but when the body becomes still"
711.000,712.700," and when our whole system"
713.900,715.200," is given a chance"
717.400,719.100," to be itself"
720.100,721.300," without having approach"
721.700,722.000," or"
723.300,724.100," external"
725.000,725.800," generate"
726.400,727.000," output"
728.100,728.400," when"
729.800,730.400," a ruption"
731.300,732.300," in the momentum"
732.900,733.700," of that kind of"
734.800,736.300," gobbling our way to likely"
737.000,737.800," churning along"
738.400,739.300," with consuming and"
739.600,741.900," producing without put"
743.000,743.500," up"
745.400,748.500," that just for a day and actually for some of you a day might be quite long time"
749.600,750.300," but when that"
751.900,752.100," happens the"
753.800,755.000," services"
757.100,757.500," great"
758.700,759.400," as a chance"
773.000,773.500," thank you you might"
778.000,778.100," see so"
780.300,781.400," they're the best you can"
782.200,782.800," you cannot"
786.200,787.400," anybody fall off"
787.800,790.300," chair or fall over in meditation session"
790.900,792.300," but you could also"
794.000,794.900," define for me"
795.700,797.700," get up and come to the front of the back"
798.200,798.500," side"
799.500,800.100," and lie down"
801.100,802.000," I've actually I think"
805.200,805.900," that's the cushion"
806.400,807.100," for the monitor"
808.300,808.600," you can"
810.800,812.100," get yourself a little caution"
813.900,815.000," and lay it gently down"
816.300,817.100," arrow stick I think you"

850.700,851.100," I hope"
851.500,853.000," that you could hear"
853.500,854.300," most of the above"
855.000,855.800," we're not going to do some"
856.300,856.900," some sitting"
857.700,857.700," so"
858.900,859.400," well"
865.000,867.100," so okay there's a cool shot"
867.700,868.000," I was"
868.300,875.000," when I when I saw the the number of people coming at this we had a weightless believe it or not and cut it off but um"
875.600,876.400," the max that"
876.800,878.300," the room they thought that run could help"
878.700,880.400," I was a bit worried about ventilation but"
881.500,883.300," you know that we might as well get stuffy but"
883.900,884.300," it's high"
885.200,885.900," it's high scene"
886.800,887.500," so I think we'll be okay"
888.300,889.800," but if we feel we need it we can bring a"
891.900,892.500," okay close"
894.000,895.300," is there anybody here"
896.300,898.900," who thinks that they've never meditated before"
902.200,902.400," okay"
905.600,907.900," so that's that's that's telling me into a comfortable"
908.700,909.300," seated position"
935.200,937.800," so that's spend just a little bit of time"
939.100,944.200," getting balanced if you're if you're if you're back is against the back of the chair that's fine just"
944.700,945.700," just stay like that but"
946.400,948.100," looking around I can see quite a number"
948.700,952.400," I think have that back away from the back of the chair that's that's good to"
953.700,957.000," and if that's the situation you have your back is"
957.700,959.900," unsupported then we want to be balanced"
961.300,962.400," so have a little bit of"
964.300,966.300," lumbar Arms that's to say"
966.600,968.200," let your belly come forward a bit"
969.100,969.600," if you're"
970.600,971.200," sitting me"

1216.600,1217.400," a Sensation"
1227.900,1229.400," from the souls of the feet"

1303.900,1304.900," just rest"
1316.400,1317.000," feeling"
1320.100,1320.900," sensing"
1322.200,1322.600," the body"
1351.300,1352.400," let's start to"
1354.300,1357.000," open up also to the soundscape"
1359.300,1361.700," the great field of sounds"
1363.800,1364.400," the space"
1364.900,1365.700," of sounds"
1372.200,1374.300," just let it do what it does"
1427.800,1429.500," let's bring in a little label"
1430.700,1430.900," here"
1433.800,1436.400," every few seconds say in your mind"
1437.900,1438.300," kind"
1439.000,1441.300," of plainly matter of fact gently"
1442.300,1443.100," say to yourself"
1449.100,1449.600," hearing hear"
1453.300,1455.200," as a means to point your"
1455.800,1457.900," attention that open your awareness"
1460.000,1460.500," to the"
1461.500,1462.400," tapestry"
1463.700,1464.300," of sound"
1468.200,1468.700," hearing"
1535.000,1535.600,"here"
1541.300,1541.400," again"
1599.300,1600.600,"so your eyes"
1600.900,1602.000," may be closed"
1604.200,1606.800," some of you may have your eyes open"
1608.200,1609.700," as some of you may have them"
1610.700,1614.500," a tiny bit open allowing allowing in"
1615.500,1616.700," a little blurry"
1618.500,1619.600," light but whichever it is"
1621.200,1623.300," the operation of seeing"
1624.400,1625.100," is happening"
1627.400,1629.500," so if they're closed you'll be"
1630.500,1631.300," seeing"
1632.500,1634.000," a screen"
1635.100,1635.400," of"
1636.900,1638.300," a kind of Grey scale"
1640.500,1642.300," which will have variations"
1644.000,1645.000," of light and dark"
1645.800,1646.000," in"
1647.800,1649.200," it it may have some"
1650.900,1651.700," colouration"
1654.900,1656.400," if there are open"
1658.300,1659.000," and lowered"
1660.200,1661.400," which is what we recommend"
1662.400,1663.300," if they're"
1663.700,1664.900," open to lower the gates"
1666.700,1667.300," you'll be seeing"
1668.900,1670.100," best screen also"
1671.800,1672.000," with"
1672.800,1673.900," colours and shapes"
1678.200,1678.900," either way"
1681.800,1682.400," we rest"
1683.000,1683.600," with it"
1683.900,1684.200," as"
1685.700,1686.300," simply"
1687.600,1687.800," the"
1688.900,1690.300," actual fabric"
1690.900,1691.500," that we're seeing"
1692.600,1693.700," whether it's colours"
1694.500,1695.100," and shapes"
1696.900,1698.600," or basically light and dark"
1701.400,1703.100," you want to just be aware of"
1705.000,1705.800," this screen"
1707.400,1708.500," aside as well"
1710.800,1711.800," so we'll move"
1713.100,1714.100," to the label"
1720.000,1720.700," dude seeing"
1726.000,1726.600," see"
1730.400,1733.700," the guide our attention to awareness"
1735.000,1735.900," of the screen"
1736.700,1737.400," of sight"
1739.700,1740.300," see you"
1745.700,1746.400," see seeing"
1831.000,1831.700," see"
1866.800,1867.700," this is the"
1868.600,1870.000," sensorium"
1872.000,1872.600," the box"
1873.400,1874.600," of sensations"
1876.400,1876.600," that"
1876.900,1878.300," are experienced is"
1879.700,1881.100," basically made of"
1883.300,1884.000," seeing"
1885.200,1885.600," hearing"
1887.700,1888.800," body sensations"
1897.300,1900.000," of course sometimes this"
1900.800,1902.600," smell and taste as well"
1908.200,1908.800," this is it"
1916.300,1917.200," let me rest"
1918.500,1919.700," in the sensorium"
1921.700,1922.100," just"
1923.000,1923.300," be"
1924.500,1924.800," with"
1926.900,1927.200," this"
1928.200,1929.500," basic Primary"
1931.000,1932.300," sense channels"
1932.700,1933.100," since"
1933.800,1934.900," experiences"
1936.200,1936.600," rest"
1939.100,1940.200," in the sensorium"
1946.000,1946.300," I stay"
1961.200,1962.000," home"
1962.600,1963.100," basically"
1978.300,1979.600," now"
2038.400,2043.700," so the"
2045.600,2047.200," the question really is what"
2048.500,2051.300," what keeps us away from home"
2052.600,2054.400," what takes us away from"
2054.800,2055.100," this"
2057.400,2058.500," and the answer is"
2059.000,2060.100," usually thoughts"
2061.000,2061.900," and feelings"
2062.900,2064.400," that commonly arise"
2066.000,2068.500," so we want to include them"
2069.600,2070.600," they are welcome"
2071.000,2071.400," also"
2073.500,2074.000," we're not"
2074.700,2075.500," trying to banish"
2076.400,2076.800," thoughts"
2077.700,2078.500," and feelings"
2080.100,2081.100," quite the reverse"
2082.700,2083.800," I want to throw open"
2084.200,2084.700," the doors"
2086.000,2086.700," and welcome the"
2091.800,2093.200," so we'll have a simple"
2095.000,2095.500," method"
2096.400,2098.000," through the day any time"
2099.100,2101.100," you recognise that you've been"
2101.800,2102.900," sort of elsewhere"
2104.200,2104.900," just check"
2106.300,2107.100," what was it"
2108.300,2108.800," memories"
2110.200,2110.500," was it"
2111.000,2111.400," planning"
2113.400,2113.800," was it"
2114.600,2115.200," imagining"
2118.200,2118.900," memories"
2120.000,2120.900," plans"
2122.500,2123.500," imaginings"
2125.600,2126.800," so when we've been"
2128.000,2128.400," away"
2130.000,2130.300," from here"
2132.100,2132.900," and home base"
2134.300,2135.400," which we all will"
2136.100,2136.800," wonder from"
2137.800,2139.300," quite often in fact"
2141.600,2144.300," our practice is simply to notice"
2145.800,2146.700," that we've been away"
2148.400,2149.800," and then just check"
2151.500,2152.500," was in memories"
2153.400,2154.300," was it planning"
2155.500,2155.800," was it"
2156.400,2157.100," imagining"
2158.500,2159.800," and just pop"
2161.000,2161.500," the thinking"
2162.400,2164.100," into the appropriate folder"
2167.100,2167.800," and come back"
2170.000,2170.500," to here"
2173.800,2174.400," but hearing"
2177.300,2177.900," to seeing"
2180.300,2181.300," or sensing the body"
2185.500,2187.000," just a few more minutes in this"
2189.400,2189.900," hearing"
2193.000,2194.400,"oh see or"
2196.100,2197.200," sense in body"
2199.400,2200.600," but noticing"
2201.700,2202.300," where we went"
2205.100,2205.800," times we've been"
2206.300,2206.600," away"
2343.900,2345.100," urban art"
2348.400,2349.400," open to"
2350.600,2351.100," how"
2351.300,2352.700," the heart is doing"
2362.800,2363.800," literally"
2365.600,2368.400," check in with any sensation in the chest"
2372.400,2374.500," and warmly welcome"
2378.100,2379.400," it become warm"
2380.700,2382.400," and soft in the chest"
2416.000,2417.400," I give thank yourself"
2420.000,2421.400,"for giving yourself this time"
2423.500,2423.700," to"
2424.000,2425.600," to come back to yourself"
2510.400,2511.100,"so well"
2511.200,2513.500," we'll have a soft exit so"
2514.500,2514.700," don't"
2516.000,2517.100," do a hard line"
2517.900,2519.500," called end of meditation"
2520.400,2520.600," just"
2521.200,2521.900," gradually"
2524.100,2524.600," in your own"
2525.100,2526.400," sweet way sort of"
2532.400,2536.600," I don't know come kind of come out of it kind of don't come out of it the same time"
2587.300,2588.000,"I will have"
2590.200,2591.900," well we'll have the plan"
2592.300,2598.200," but maybe I should have said this earlier the plan is that we've got these two main kind of blocks in our day"
2599.500,2601.100," approximately 9:30 to 12"
2602.000,2603.200," then a couple of hours"
2604.000,2605.200," and then two to four thirty"
2606.000,2608.700," and I'm thinking that we'll have some kind of"
2609.700,2611.300," break in the middle of each of them"
2612.100,2613.500," I don't want to be too long"
2614.500,2617.900," because you know there's stuff I'd love to share with you"
2618.900,2620.100," but perhaps it'll be"
2621.000,2622.600," 10 to 15 minutes or something like that"
2623.300,2625.700," and so that's not immediately now but soon"
2626.600,2626.800," and"
2628.200,2629.300," that's a chance to"
2630.700,2633.200," that break is going to be a chance to wonder around a square"
2634.400,2634.800," safely"
2635.500,2638.800," you know however blissed out and meditation maybe there's still traffic"
2639.500,2639.600," you know"
2640.200,2640.300," and"
2641.500,2643.300," to get coffee tea"
2643.700,2643.800," and"
2644.700,2645.100," snacks"
2646.400,2646.600," and"
2650.100,2651.300," also chat"
2651.700,2654.200," you know of course but there will be some"
2654.600,2656.400," times to chat within the"
2657.300,2660.100," the portions that we're all gathered as well"
2660.900,2663.300," so if if you want to walk"
2664.000,2665.300," for example if you want to walk"
2665.800,2668.500," quietly if you in fact want to do some walking meditation"
2669.400,2672.200," and of course do that and if you see somebody"
2673.400,2674.300," you know"
2675.400,2676.000," carefully"
2676.800,2678.300," placing their steps"
2678.900,2680.900," on the ground it perhaps means they're doing and"
2681.700,2682.400," let them do it"
2683.200,2683.500," rather than"
2684.100,2685.100," open up for a chat"
2691.900,2695.200," so I'm at little bit curious about how"
2696.300,2698.000," you come to be here"
2698.500,2699.000," all of you"
2701.500,2706.000," so I want to ask Ashley for just a Show of Hands who's here"
2707.100,2708.700," because they've done"
2709.900,2712.700," one or more of Sunday"
2713.800,2715.300," original love sessions"
2716.000,2717.400," could you put up your hands if that's"
2718.000,2719.100," the case okay"
2719.600,2720.500," okay thank you"
2721.500,2722.300," who's here"
2723.000,2727.300," because they have encountered the new meditation app the way"
2728.200,2728.900," but has for that"
2729.700,2731.900," okay that's a goodly number thank you"
2732.600,2734.700," who's here because of"
2737.000,2741.400," knowing either the Oxford Oxford / London's end group or the"
2742.900,2743.900," mounting clouds and"
2744.400,2744.700," group"
2746.000,2747.500," okay that's a fair few thank you"
2748.700,2750.200," but I know I see the rest of you got here"
2752.800,2757.500," I suppose did any of you have any of you come across big through my book one blade of grass"
2758.700,2759.800," okay okay"
2760.200,2761.800," well maybe that more or less"
2762.800,2765.900," covers everybody oh who's come through meditate you"
2768.100,2769.000," okay- okay"
2769.300,2769.600," thanks"
2770.100,2770.400," great"
2771.800,2772.400," so"
2773.100,2778.000," I'm going to tell you a little bit about the way I've been teaching the last four years or so"
2778.400,2780.800," which is reflected both in the app the way"
2782.200,2783.900," and in"
2784.600,2785.800," the original love"
2786.200,2786.600," programme"
2787.100,2787.300," and"
2788.200,2790.700," what that what happened basically was when"
2791.700,2792.000," when"
2793.300,2794.000," lockdown"
2794.700,2796.100," began in early"
2796.600,2797.600," 2020"
2798.400,2799.000," with the pandemic"
2801.300,2801.800," we started"
2802.900,2803.600," mounting cloud"
2804.300,2805.700," shifted over to online"
2806.600,2807.000," world"
2807.900,2808.100," and"
2810.900,2812.000," I started teaching"
2812.900,2816.000," I realized I had to I felt I had to teach in a different way"
2816.800,2816.900," and"
2817.500,2819.500," a prepared to that it had been"
2820.300,2823.200," pretty intensive kind of hard core Zen"
2823.700,2825.300," which involves a lot of one to one"
2825.900,2828.000," brief one to one encounters with the teacher"
2828.500,2832.900," and it also involved in my case or the case of the lineage that I'm part of sambo Zen"
2833.300,2834.600," a lot of Cohen work"
2835.300,2838.500," I don't know whether any of you well I'm sure some of you are familiar with the coins"
2839.200,2840.300," there's weird little"
2841.600,2844.200," paradoxes or enigmas or riddles or"
2845.700,2846.600," nonsense really"
2847.200,2851.700," but nonsense where the power to radically transform how we experience the world"
2852.500,2854.100," in the experience known as Awakening"
2854.800,2859.500," or some call it non-duality some call it ground of being some call it"
2859.900,2862.300," original nature some call it is then calls it"
2862.700,2864.000," the original face"
2864.900,2866.900," seeing your original face seeing"
2867.500,2869.900," the face you've had since before you were born"
2870.200,2873.000," in fact before even your parents were born in fact before"
2873.700,2876.900," even your multiply great grandparents were born"
2878.000,2878.900," the face you had"
2879.400,2879.700," before"
2881.100,2884.500," the time that your four bears"
2885.100,2887.000," we're primordial fish"
2887.800,2889.100," swimming about in slime"
2889.800,2892.400," before even then that's the way they think of it"
2892.900,2895.300," and what is that original face well basically"
2896.000,2898.400," it's a fan is a poetic way of expressing"
2899.700,2902.900," the experience that all of us humans can have"
2904.000,2908.200," whereby or wherein are ordinary sense of self"
2909.700,2910.600," as a separate"
2911.200,2911.700," entity"
2912.200,2913.600," living inside this"
2914.400,2915.300," skin bag"
2916.000,2917.900," as Buddhism eloquently calls it"
2918.800,2921.000," inside this skin bag there is"
2921.400,2921.800," me"
2922.600,2924.600," and this is my skin back"
2926.100,2927.200," and everything"
2928.200,2930.600," outside the skin bag is not me"
2931.400,2933.100," and basically everything inside"
2933.700,2935.600," is the skin bag is me"
2936.200,2937.800," although it's not exactly like that"
2938.300,2939.700," because if I have a pain"
2940.800,2943.600," that's not really me it's something I'm suffering from"
2944.900,2946.500," and if I have an itch"
2947.300,2950.500," it's not really me it's something I am suffering from"
2951.800,2955.200," so it's a little unclear where the hard boundary of me"
2956.000,2956.400," actually"
2957.000,2959.200," is but it's but we know it"
2960.300,2960.900," I'm in here"
2962.600,2964.300," and I've got a little wall around me"
2965.300,2968.100," and what's within the wall is me and what's outside the water is not me"
2968.700,2972.300," so the experience of the quote unquote original face"
2973.700,2975.200," is a well a tested"
2975.900,2976.200," shift"
2977.200,2977.800," that can happen"
2978.300,2980.800," to us human beings as well as tested"
2981.300,2983.300," historically it's well a tested"
2985.000,2986.100," contemporaneously and"
2986.500,2987.400," practitioners today"
2988.500,2990.900," are various sorts including meditative"
2991.400,2992.300," and it's even now"
2992.900,2995.500," kind of well a tested or at least evidence"
2996.200,3000.100," in science the great leaps and bounds in neuroscience"
3000.800,3002.000," over the last 2030 years"
3002.600,3004.100," have made it fairly clear"
3004.900,3005.700," that actually"
3006.400,3008.600," the ordinary sense of self"
3009.100,3011.400," we're seems kind of absolute"
3011.700,3013.200," to us and definitely"
3014.000,3014.200," this"
3014.800,3017.200," person at always felt might be myself to be"
3017.600,3018.500," as long as I can remember"
3020.000,3029.200," actually all all it sort of is is certain activations of midline networks and the Brain which are concerned with narrative with story when those"
3029.900,3031.700," centres are active"
3032.800,3033.900," sense of self is active"
3034.400,3035.700," when they're not active"
3036.300,3036.900," sense of self"
3037.500,3038.000," is actually"
3039.900,3040.800," in a bands"
3041.600,3043.100," but we don't know notice it"
3044.300,3046.000," typically because the moment"
3046.900,3049.300," we're sort of engaged with the next thing"
3050.300,3051.500," sent herself is there to do it"
3051.900,3052.200," as well"
3052.700,3052.800," so"
3053.700,3056.500," we actually probably a frequently"
3059.400,3060.200," punctuating"
3060.800,3061.700," the sense of self"
3063.400,3064.900," or it may even be the other way around we"
3065.500,3068.000," we're having this seamless experience"
3069.400,3071.500," of all the sense experience"
3072.400,3073.900," now now now now now"
3074.900,3075.200," now now"
3077.600,3078.900," but we commonly"
3079.700,3087.000," ping in the sense of self this is my life this is me this is my hand this is my this this is my voice"
3088.200,3090.200," etc this is my experience"
3091.300,3092.200," but it may be the"
3093.000,3093.800," it's clever"
3094.100,3097.400," because when that little sense of me switches on"
3098.200,3100.000," it brings it appears"
3100.500,3101.500," to bring with it"
3101.900,3103.100," the entire thread"
3104.600,3105.400," see what I mean it's like"
3105.900,3107.400," it's actually only a ping"
3107.800,3108.000," but it"
3108.600,3110.600," Carrie's it seems to carry with it"
3111.100,3112.900," the whole thread of my life"
3114.000,3115.000," and in that"
3115.400,3116.000," view"
3116.800,3119.600," you know my life is a kind of thread"
3120.200,3122.000," with all these beads of experience"
3123.000,3124.900," to us strong along here"
3126.100,3126.500," in"
3127.100,3127.900," the experience"
3128.400,3128.700," of"
3129.900,3131.200," the non-dual"
3131.600,3133.300," is called non-dual"
3133.900,3134.500," because"
3136.200,3136.500," that"
3137.700,3138.100," set up"
3138.800,3139.800," me in here"
3141.000,3142.200," everything else out there"
3143.100,3144.800," that is considered to be"
3145.300,3145.500," a"
3146.100,3146.800," dual"
3147.500,3149.300," is the fundamental duality"
3151.100,3151.800," of self"
3152.800,3153.300," and other"
3154.400,3155.200," me"
3156.100,3156.400," and"
3157.300,3157.800," everything else"
3158.700,3159.800," that's that's why it's called"
3161.400,3162.100," dualistic"
3163.200,3164.300," I mean you I know you might think"
3164.700,3166.800," well it's not doing this is it it's me and a"
3166.900,3168.000," 10 trillion other thing"
3168.800,3170.700," but it's deer realistic in the sense that"
3171.700,3173.400," there's somehow a me"
3174.400,3175.400," and there's somehow and"
3175.800,3176.300," all else"
3177.800,3180.000," see you get that it's sort of kind of is dual"
3180.900,3182.200," is it me and not me"
3183.500,3184.600," basic duality of it"
3185.400,3187.700," so in the experience of the non-dual"
3191.600,3192.200," essentially"
3193.500,3196.000," it's it's there's a little bit more to it than we might think"
3196.400,3196.900," first of all"
3198.400,3199.300," the wall"
3200.000,3201.000," the separates me"
3201.800,3202.900," from all that's not me"
3203.800,3204.400," collapses"
3208.400,3210.700," but also in doing so"
3211.400,3212.100," the thread"
3213.800,3214.100," snaps"
3215.500,3216.700," in fact the thread"
3217.900,3218.700," show"
3219.200,3220.100," is revealed"
3220.600,3222.400," shows itself to have been"
3223.300,3223.500," only"
3224.300,3224.800," an idea"
3227.100,3228.900," and when we see that it was only an idea"
3231.400,3232.800," it changes it"
3234.600,3237.300," because we see that it wasn't what we thought it was"
3237.800,3239.000," we thought it was real"
3240.600,3241.900," when we see that the self"
3242.800,3243.200," also"
3244.400,3245.300," is actually just"
3246.600,3247.100," the thoughts"
3247.900,3248.700," it's just kind of"
3250.500,3252.400," cognitive activations"
3254.800,3256.500," that also undercuts it"
3257.200,3257.500," because we"
3258.200,3259.300," then realise"
3260.400,3261.400," those thoughts"
3262.100,3263.900," weren't referring to something else"
3264.900,3267.100," we think they're referring to a real thing"
3267.800,3268.300," but in fact"
3268.900,3269.300," there only"
3270.000,3270.300," thoughts"
3271.200,3274.500," okay now where I'm just slightly glazed looks is this"
3277.100,3278.400," is this landing at all"
3278.900,3279.400," yeah yeah"
3279.900,3281.500," because it's important because"
3283.000,3285.500," it's important because it's one side"
3286.700,3286.900," of"
3287.900,3291.900,"the meditative project it's one side of what meditation is for"
3292.600,3294.900," and it's not the one that you mostly hear about"
3297.000,3298.800," the ones the one who mostly hear about"
3299.500,3299.700," is"
3300.500,3301.100," mindfulness"
3302.100,3302.400," for"
3304.300,3305.700," nervous system help"
3306.700,3307.000," basically"
3307.600,3309.800," right that's that's been a stress reduction and"
3311.100,3311.300," and"
3313.600,3314.000," ah"
3315.600,3316.800," handling stress"
3318.500,3321.500," being okay in this in this frantic world we live in"
3323.200,3323.400," that's"
3324.100,3325.100," absolutely essential"
3325.900,3326.500," and it's one"
3327.300,3329.800," if that's all we want from meditation fantastic"
3331.000,3331.600," fantastic"
3332.600,3332.700," and"
3333.800,3335.700," and yet also there is a another site"
3336.300,3337.700," which is the which is kind of"
3338.900,3340.700," I mean in the old old school"
3341.300,3343.100," you know old traditions"
3343.800,3345.900," that have come down to us like Zen"
3346.600,3347.600," is the other thing"
3348.300,3349.800," that they felt ever really for"
3350.000,3351.200," because it's a bigger deal"
3352.000,3353.100," it is a bigger deal to"
3353.800,3353.900," to"
3355.300,3357.700," comfort and assuage and help"
3358.500,3360.100," and bring compassionate"
3360.600,3362.800," support to ourselves"
3363.300,3365.200," is fantastic and actually"
3365.800,3369.100," I believe in it as a as an essential thing for all of us to do"
3371.300,3372.100," and on the other hand"
3372.600,3377.300," to see that what I thought I was is not the case"
3378.000,3381.200," and instead it's something so much better"
3382.500,3383.800," it's so much better"
3385.200,3387.100," because when the wall Falls"
3387.900,3389.300," we're part of everything"
3390.200,3391.500," and that is just"
3392.400,3393.100," mind-blowing"
3394.100,3395.700," and the healing it brings"
3396.500,3396.700," is"
3397.400,3398.300," incomparable"
3399.000,3400.000," because we find"
3400.900,3401.600," We Belong"
3402.600,3403.200," utterly"
3403.800,3404.900," to to the whole world"
3406.200,3407.400," we haven't been this"
3408.200,3410.600," loan agent stalking the Earth"
3411.800,3412.900," lonely and China"
3413.500,3415.100," figure out how to not hurt"
3415.800,3416.700," and get what"
3417.400,3418.100," we want and"
3418.800,3420.700," avoid all the terrible things"
3421.300,3422.700," that actually will happen"
3423.100,3423.900," they will happen"
3424.500,3426.600," we will have catastrophic losses"
3427.500,3428.000," I'm sorry to"
3428.600,3429.700," say but we will"
3430.800,3432.500," they happen sooner or later"
3432.900,3433.600," the people we love"
3434.100,3434.700," most dearly"
3436.600,3437.200," they go"
3438.100,3440.000," or they get into all kinds of trouble"
3440.800,3443.200," that it's not so easy to get out of or they get"
3444.500,3447.100," the very difficult long-term"
3447.800,3448.800," health challenges"
3449.800,3450.400," and and"
3451.200,3452.100," we ourselves"
3452.700,3452.900," will"
3454.700,3459.000," alas it's going to happen to us you know some some manner or form"
3460.000,3461.300," and then we'll be gone"
3462.200,3462.500," so the"
3467.000,3467.900," so to find"
3468.500,3468.800," that"
3471.400,3473.100," the core of who I thought I was"
3474.900,3475.500," it's kind of"
3477.200,3480.400," it is something absolutely treasurable"
3481.600,3482.200," but it's not"
3483.500,3485.300," it's not exactly what I thought"
3486.300,3486.500," it's"
3487.400,3488.700," it's it's it's as if the"
3489.400,3491.200," self that I thought I was"
3492.500,3494.100," is a kind of portal"
3494.800,3497.700," I I always think of this way these days is like a gateway"
3498.900,3501.300," so we need to love it get to know it"
3502.400,3504.200," but it opens us up"
3505.200,3505.300," to"
3507.100,3508.200," to being part of everything"
3515.200,3515.400," and"
3519.300,3521.500," so just a little light little love"
3521.900,3525.200," Like fair or a Saturday morning nothing too serious"
3527.300,3528.700," but anyway"
3529.400,3532.400," what happened the last few years in Henry's world with"
3532.900,3534.000," covid and everything"
3534.300,3535.000," was I started"
3536.000,3536.800," no longer"
3537.500,3538.100," hammering"
3538.400,3539.300," thumping the tub"
3539.800,3540.500," of Awakening"
3540.900,3541.500," which might"
3541.900,3544.600," there's an end line I have been reared in really sort of"
3545.400,3546.000," encourage that"
3546.400,3547.300," so all about"
3547.800,3549.200," seeing who you really are"
3549.800,3551.300," discovering who you're really not"
3552.400,3556.300," kill yourself you know say well actually that I say that but anyway"
3556.800,3559.400," my way of teaching really changed when I"
3560.000,3562.000," couldn't berate people one to one you know"
3563.300,3564.700," in the little interviews with it"
3565.900,3569.900," and and actually also I had some blobs of my own in life"
3570.500,3571.200," all of which"
3571.900,3573.000," just combined"
3573.300,3575.900," to make me need to teach differently and"
3576.500,3578.600," actually my heart was broken again"
3579.400,3580.300," not for the first time"
3581.000,3583.100," but it was broken again in a new way"
3583.600,3585.600," somehow and there had a brain in"
3586.100,3586.500," my"
3588.100,3588.700," my never"
3589.300,3592.400," strong cognitive capacity was further diminished"
3593.300,3594.600," and it was the best thing"
3595.400,3596.800," it was the best thing actually"
3597.400,3598.500," a blow to the head"
3599.100,3604.000," I mean I'm sorry I shouldn't make light of it was very difficult and lots of people suffered terribly from TBI"
3604.600,3605.900," I had hard time too but"
3606.200,3606.900," it was the best thing"
3607.600,3612.100," it really was the best possible thing because I don't live in my head anymore I live in my heart"
3612.700,3615.100," and that's what I really want to share because"
3615.600,3616.500," if we get this"
3617.300,3618.300," if we know how to"
3618.900,3620.900," have a broken heart and be okay with it"
3621.600,3622.700," because a broken heart"
3623.600,3625.800," actually of course we don't wish it on anyone"
3626.100,3628.900," but it is a good thing because when the heart breaks"
3629.700,3630.400," it opens"
3632.400,3634.200," I think it's the only way to have an open heart"
3637.100,3638.900," I saw you I don't mean surgery"
3641.100,3646.600," I think it is the only way to really have the heart be open and if the heart is open then the heart can be whole"
3647.500,3648.200," and we can"
3649.100,3650.100," we live in a different way"
3650.600,3652.600," and actually then the best thing"
3653.100,3654.400," is it doesn't matter so much"
3655.700,3658.100," whether you think you have a self or don't think you have yourself"
3658.900,3661.400," whether you live walk around feeling yourself"
3662.100,3665.400," or whether you've opened up in that spectacular way there's possible"
3666.000,3668.900," and know that you're everything and actually doesn't matter as much"
3669.600,3670.200," if your heart"
3671.100,3672.700," is if you're living in your heart"
3674.200,3675.800," that really doesn't matter quite as much"
3677.000,3677.400," in other words"
3678.000,3680.000," the two great projects of meditation"
3680.800,3681.400," chill out"
3682.100,3682.700," and wake up"
3684.600,3685.800," if you're living in your heart"
3688.100,3688.600," you're okay"
3690.500,3696.100," and both of those are fine they might help with that it's fine but they're not as important"
3698.900,3700.000," so I called the program"
3700.500,3702.000," not original face"
3703.500,3704.700," which was the Zen term"
3705.400,3707.400," for having the great non-dual Awakening"
3708.000,3709.600," seeing your original face"
3710.200,3711.200," from way back before you"
3711.900,3713.200," yeah that prehistoric fish"
3715.300,3716.200," and you could be that"
3716.600,3719.700," you could be some of the predates that by the way because in"
3720.200,3721.200," the non-dual"
3721.500,3722.000," there is"
3722.600,3724.700," the thread is snapped"
3725.100,3726.100," there's no time"
3727.100,3728.400," there's simply isn't time"
3729.200,3730.500," and they're simply isn't"
3730.900,3732.000," actually also"
3732.800,3733.100," space"
3734.000,3735.200," space and time"
3735.900,3737.200," are revealed"
3738.600,3738.700," to be"
3740.200,3741.300," a conceptual"
3741.700,3742.500," construct"
3742.900,3743.600," that obviously"
3744.700,3745.100," no way"
3746.200,3746.700," you're there"
3747.100,3747.600," I'm here"
3748.100,3748.700," their space"
3749.700,3752.800," you said something a moment ago and you're saying something different now"
3753.300,3753.900," there's time"
3755.500,3757.200," I actually honestly I disagree"
3758.700,3759.700," there's just this"
3761.100,3762.100," there is really just"
3762.700,3762.900," this"
3768.400,3775.400," but and then we'll say we'll see William maybe we'll see that it doesn't matter so much as long as our heart is open it doesn't matter so much"
3776.500,3779.100," because this is what matters so I called it original love"
3780.200,3781.000," not original face"
3781.900,3784.100," meaning really have a warm heart"
3784.600,3785.400," have an open heart"
3785.800,3787.900," be able to feel the pain of your heart in your heart"
3789.000,3789.300," grief"
3790.100,3791.200," is okay well"
3794.300,3797.300," do you know what I mean it's not I mean it's not it's painful"
3797.900,3798.500," but it's not"
3800.700,3802.000," it's not without it's"
3808.100,3809.200," it's blessings"
3811.000,3811.200," yeah"
3812.400,3814.300," so just about to end"
3815.100,3816.300," and spring us all"
3816.700,3822.000," but I wanted to just say one last thing which was that the the way"
3824.300,3825.100," that I"
3825.600,3826.900," that I sort of came to"
3827.500,3828.300," how to kind of"
3829.200,3831.100," how to be trying to share all the above"
3831.600,3833.100," this is the most important bit actually was"
3833.800,3836.000," it was based on an experience I had"
3837.000,3837.800," many years ago"
3842.200,3845.400," when I'd been training for some years in"
3846.500,3849.100," at first in transcendental meditation and then in"
3849.500,3850.100," in Zen"
3850.900,3853.300," and then I was on the writing assignment in Venezuela"
3854.200,3855.800," and I I was"
3856.700,3859.400," I'd finished the article that I had to write"
3860.100,3862.900," and I was also under a contractor writer book"
3863.500,3864.700," that I hadn't started and"
3865.900,3869.600," kind of couldn't figure out how to start so I decided to spend a few weeks"
3870.500,3871.300," in this little"
3872.800,3873.300," fishing"
3873.600,3874.000," town"
3874.300,3876.900," or village really on the North coast of Venezuela"
3877.600,3878.700," called Santa Fe"
3879.400,3881.600," which is a town that I also had me to live in"
3881.900,3885.200," in New Mexico so I kind of the last course go the same name I go there"
3885.800,3890.000," and and I went there and got a room and and and spent about six weeks"
3890.900,3891.900," starting to write that book"
3893.300,3895.100," which actually happened to be about Santa Fe"
3895.800,3900.100," the other one and while there every evening I went out onto the beach"
3900.700,3901.600," to do my sit"
3902.400,3903.400," my evening sit"
3903.800,3905.000," and that just kind of"
3906.000,3907.800," heaped up a little bit of sand and"
3908.700,3912.600," in the warmly are you know as the as the day was ending just sat there"
3913.400,3913.600," and"
3915.400,3916.000," basked"
3916.500,3918.300," in the crop skiller"
3919.000,3919.400," are"
3919.900,3921.100," in a just very"
3923.000,3923.400," simple"
3924.200,3927.500," and the second night I was doing it"
3928.700,3931.000," I heard a couple of voices in your senior"
3931.600,3931.900," and I"
3933.300,3936.900," thought nothing of it and then they persisted and I looked up and too boys with that"
3937.500,3938.400," in their short"
3939.100,3941.000," saying what are you doing and I said well"
3941.500,3942.900," estoy meditando"
3944.700,3946.200," I want to quite sure is a real word"
3946.500,3952.200," but it's and they said what is that and I I kind of the best I could explain what it was and they said"
3952.900,3954.000," can we do it too"
3954.800,3955.900," and I said well of course yeah"
3956.300,3957.800," why not I suppose you know and"
3958.400,3958.500," so"
3959.300,3960.000," I helped them"
3960.700,3961.700," make their little sort of"
3962.300,3963.500," stool and a sand"
3964.300,3970.000," and they sat and I told them how to cross their legs because all I knew then was zen style you know"
3970.700,3973.600," and how to follow the breath account the breath"
3974.500,3980.600," and say well let's just do five minutes great so after five minutes a great you've done great that's five minutes say can we do a bit more"
3981.400,3983.800," sure so we did another five minutes and so that's enough"
3984.800,3987.300," fine and then you know we chatted a bit and off they went"
3987.800,3992.200," the next night when I came out I'm not night it was late afternoon when I came out to do it again"
3993.000,3993.900," four boys with that"
3994.300,3995.500," and they wanted to do it again"
3995.900,3997.700," and then and it became a thing"
3998.400,4000.900," they brought their friends occasionally they brought a parent"
4001.600,4001.800," and"
4003.200,4004.400," one night I didn't go"
4005.200,4008.500," and there were knocking on my door in the morning where were you last night"
4009.000,4013.500," so I did it every night but what happened when we sat there under the"
4014.300,4015.000," the growing"
4015.600,4017.100," Twilight at the end of day"
4017.900,4018.800," was really"
4019.300,4019.700," different"
4020.300,4021.700," to what I was used to"
4022.700,4023.600," sitting in"
4024.000,4025.100," the Monastery"
4025.900,4030.200," the centers the retreat centers whatever that I've been to before"
4031.500,4032.000," it was"
4034.100,4034.700," deeply"
4036.300,4037.100," relaxed"
4038.200,4040.700," we heard the wind in the palm trees"
4041.600,4042.400," the lapping"
4043.300,4045.800," of the vast ocean right now on the beach"
4047.800,4049.300," the warm sand beneath us"
4051.500,4053.900," that are pixelating"
4054.500,4055.300," at dusk"
4056.500,4057.000," everything"
4058.000,4059.200," relaxing the world"
4060.300,4060.600," happy"
4061.400,4062.400," Close of day"
4063.000,4063.800," sounds of cooking"
4064.500,4065.100," in the village"
4066.100,4068.200," laughter chit chat in the distance"
4069.100,4070.300," and us just sitting that"
4071.700,4072.100," and I thought"
4073.200,4073.600," this is"
4074.600,4075.000," this is"
4075.600,4076.000," this is"
4076.700,4077.500," the way to do it"
4078.700,4079.300," it's just"
4084.300,4084.900," exactly"
4088.300,4090.200," it's rejoining the world"
4091.400,4092.100," that's what it is"
4093.100,4094.600," rejoining the world"
4097.500,4101.000," so when we started doing all our online stuff that's what I wanted to convey"
4102.000,4103.500," this easy path"
4105.700,4107.700," that has these great possibilities in it"
4108.300,4108.700," for sure"
4109.900,4110.400," both of them"
4110.800,4111.600," you know both of"
4112.600,4116.800," because there's important to stress that because 100 million people think meditation is just about"
4117.400,4118.400," mindful stress relief"
4119.200,4119.700," fantastic"
4120.300,4121.800," fantastic we want that it's great"
4122.600,4122.700," and"
4124.000,4126.000," there is this radical"
4126.700,4129.700," reappraisal of what your life is that's possible"
4131.900,4132.300," also"
4134.100,4135.100," but both of them"
4136.400,4137.500," the way he want to do it"
4138.400,4138.600," is"
4140.900,4141.500," just coming"
4142.500,4143.200," into rest"
4145.100,4145.900," resting here"
4148.600,4149.600," is a Path of"
4151.100,4152.800," it's not just a path of"
4153.500,4154.200," not doing"
4155.900,4157.000," it's not about doing"
4157.900,4159.100," it's about not doing"
4161.000,4161.200," yeah"
4161.700,4163.000," there's a part of not doing"
4163.700,4164.400," but actually"
4165.600,4166.600," it's a path"
4166.800,4167.300," I think"
4168.400,4169.700," of undoing"
4171.600,4172.200," of actually"
4172.500,4173.600," undoing"
4175.300,4177.600," it's like whatever notes there may be"
4179.000,4179.200," in US"
4180.200,4181.900," they want to untie themselves"
4183.800,4186.400," that all the tight little bits of strings"
4187.500,4191.700," was that the chief defects of Henry king was chewing a little bits of string or something"
4192.600,4193.100," I mean like that"
4194.000,4196.200," all these little I lost their tied themselves in"
4196.700,4200.200," the last they tied themselves so tight and not inside"
4201.900,4203.200," or Henry died or something"
4203.700,4204.800," do you know that little ditty"
4205.700,4206.300," no okay"
4207.700,4209.800," with weird stuff that flows up sometimes"
4211.100,4213.800," but we there's little bits of string tied up in u.s."
4214.700,4215.800," they want to untie"
4216.700,4217.600," and we feel it"
4218.200,4219.500," we see them all us"
4221.000,4223.500," floppy bits of string that are untied themselves"
4226.500,4227.500," UN"
4229.200,4230.400," so let this be"
4230.700,4231.300," a day"
4231.800,4232.000," of"
4232.800,4233.400," undoing"
4234.600,4235.400," so with that"
4236.200,4236.500," let us"
4238.700,4239.800," understand that"
4240.400,4241.300," unwalkable"
4242.300,4246.700," get tea and coffee I'm going to go to the Lou and walk around the square"
4248.600,4248.700," and"
4250.400,4251.300," and regather"
4253.100,4253.900," in"
4255.200,4256.200," I'm going to say kind of"
4258.000,4258.300," well"
4259.000,4264.700," we could just say 12 11 on the hour which is very convenient but I think 10 minutes"
4267.000,4268.600," ah might be just a bit tight"
4268.900,4270.700," sometimes we won't we're probably"
4271.500,4272.300," try to be here"
4273.200,4276.800," so that you're all set to restart at five minutes past to that"
4277.400,4278.300," I've got 15 minutes"
4281.700,4282.300," thank you all very much"
4296.400,4297.700," okay let's be"
4299.000,4299.900," making our"
4300.200,4302.200," gentle ways back"
4303.700,4303.900," to"
4305.900,4306.400," the sitting"
4309.200,4310.800," got an experiment going on right now"
4311.700,4313.500," with the my King is this okay"
4314.700,4315.200," yep okay"
4335.900,4338.400," so let's practice a little bit of waiting"
4340.000,4340.500," just to be"
4341.200,4341.500," being"
4342.400,4344.600," quite at peace and at rest"
4346.200,4346.500," well"
4348.500,4348.800," we're"
4352.200,4354.000," about to re-launch"
4355.300,4355.800," so to speak"
4369.600,4369.900," really"
4371.000,4373.800," and just kind of take it in but here we are"
4374.900,4375.700," and a beautiful"
4377.100,4377.400," really"
4378.400,4379.200," beautiful day"
4382.700,4383.900," I got to London yesterday"
4385.300,4385.800," and it was"
4387.500,4387.600," very"
4388.900,4390.400," very much the Old London I remember"
4391.000,4391.700," yeah"
4393.100,4394.600," very skies and a bit of rain"
4395.400,4398.400," I shall staying in the part of underneath the Living I've been in West London"
4399.600,4401.400," with the my old friend Eddie"
4402.300,4402.400," and"
4404.200,4408.200," of course brought back a lot of not just memories so much as Sensation"
4409.100,4411.000," what it's like to be in that part of town"
4412.200,4412.500," we"
4413.200,4415.200," place they used to live we had a"
4415.900,4417.800," really good view of the Westway"
4418.600,4419.900," we're back right up on it"
4421.500,4423.700," but I grew to like it very much actually the"
4424.000,4425.700," I thought it was like listening to South"
4427.400,4427.800," the traffic"
4430.000,4432.100," but it was scruffy very scruffy"
4432.600,4434.100," and it kind of still is a bit actually"
4434.600,4437.700," I thought I thought it all would have all smartened up"
4438.500,4439.700," more than it has in fact"
4442.100,4443.200," that pockets of"
4444.000,4444.900," North Kensington"
4446.500,4447.900," just to start there"
4451.300,4453.200," but the preciousness had just being here"
4455.100,4456.700," when the lovely thing with"
4460.300,4461.100," audio okay"
4461.800,4462.000," yeah"
4462.400,4466.000," okay so lovely thing with with the path of meditation is that"
4466.800,4467.700," more and more"
4470.000,4471.100," it can teach us"
4471.900,4473.900," and is a work in progress for"
4474.400,4475.300," me certainly"
4476.200,4478.300," to be okay with what's going on so that"
4478.900,4479.700," there's a place"
4480.200,4482.100," that somehow sort of don't"
4484.200,4486.000," take a Zone of equanimity"
4487.000,4487.100," that"
4488.000,4488.400," no"
4489.500,4490.400," it's not a physical"
4491.800,4492.400," it's a"
4495.600,4496.000," it's a"
4497.700,4500.500," it's a space or something like that it's a"
4502.200,4503.100," it's a lovely"
4503.700,4505.500," thing that switch is on"
4506.600,4508.700," that we know when we're there"
4509.400,4510.500," and it's not a thing"
4511.500,4512.000," but it's not"
4513.300,4515.100," nothing it's something"
4515.500,4518.200," but it's not really a thing but it's something"
4518.700,4519.600," that we get to know"
4520.000,4521.200," and it's switches on"
4522.000,4525.300," and I can only talk about in vague terms because it doesn't have words"
4526.700,4527.900," but it's a lovely thing"
4528.800,4529.600," but it's not a thing"
4530.400,4531.100," but it's not nothing"
4531.800,4533.300," but it's not something but it's not nothing"
4534.100,4535.200," and it's switches on"
4535.800,4537.400," and we get to know it better and better"
4538.200,4539.200," and it's kind of"
4540.100,4540.800," home base"
4541.600,4543.700," and when we're connected to it"
4544.800,4545.600," good things can happen"
4546.700,4547.700," and we appreciate them"
4548.300,4550.100," but we don't actually need them"
4551.800,4553.000," bad things can happen"
4554.400,4554.900," and we"
4556.100,4556.700," feel them"
4559.300,4560.600," and we're actually not"
4563.100,4563.900," derailed"
4567.000,4568.900," we may be a little bit but not for long"
4570.400,4570.800," and we can"
4571.400,4574.800," we can take them we can roll with them they can flow through us"
4576.000,4578.100," because this place is not solid"
4578.600,4579.700," it's not a thing it's that"
4580.200,4581.600," this is the this is not"
4582.600,4585.600," maybe this is what grows in us the more we"
4589.700,4590.700,"ugh the more we"
4592.000,4592.800," perforate"
4593.200,4594.400," ordinary censor self"
4595.500,4596.200," the more the"
4596.800,4599.300," ordinary censor self becomes attenuated"
4600.500,4601.500," becomes thinner"
4601.800,4603.600," it can become very thin"
4604.200,4605.800," like thread bear cloth"
4606.900,4609.300," like a carpet that's been walked on so much"
4610.400,4612.500," that you see the weave underneath"
4614.200,4614.400," the"
4615.100,4615.400," the"
4616.900,4617.500," shag"
4618.200,4618.900," that alright words"
4622.200,4625.300," I think there's a better word but you know what I mean of the carpet you know"
4628.200,4630.800," it's red there we've and then sometimes the"
4631.300,4634.000," that sense of self becomes so thread back"
4634.900,4637.300," that you could hold it up to the light and see through"
4638.700,4640.700," and then you realise it's the thing of beauty"
4641.800,4643.600," and then you realise you don't have to cling to"
4644.600,4647.300," and then he realised you're not quite who you thought"
4648.200,4649.600," and you don't quite know who you are"
4650.200,4651.100," and that's ok"
4652.100,4653.900," great old body Dharma"
4654.200,4655.200," one of these Zen"
4656.200,4656.700," Titans"
4657.800,4658.700," have Awakening"
4658.900,4659.800," he was asked"
4660.700,4661.900," you know the story he was"
4662.800,4663.000," he was"
4663.600,4665.700," charged by his teacher"
4666.000,4668.300," a woman actually called president atara"
4669.100,4669.500," that when"
4671.900,4672.600," having it go"
4673.000,4674.800," 60 years after her death"
4675.800,4677.000," he bowed armour"
4677.200,4678.900," her kind of star student"
4679.800,4681.100," should go from India"
4682.400,4684.100," to the far away land of China"
4685.100,4685.500," taking"
4686.400,4687.000," the teaching"
4687.900,4689.100," which is really a practice"
4689.500,4690.100," not a teacher"
4690.900,4691.900," taking the practice"
4692.300,4692.700," to China"
4694.300,4697.300," he was 67 when she gave the instruction"
4698.200,4700.700," and he was a dutiful obedient student"
4701.200,4703.200," so at the age of 127"
4704.900,4706.900," he went to China which took three years"
4708.100,4710.600," charged or taxed bird with the burden"
4711.900,4715.000," the heavy joyous burden of passing on"
4715.700,4716.500," the wondrous"
4718.400,4719.400," thing that is not a thing"
4720.400,4720.600," that"
4721.400,4723.200," she had found in here had found at all"
4724.200,4725.600," great teachers before had found"
4728.600,4729.300," it sound okay"
4730.100,4730.800," sound is okay"
4731.400,4731.500," yeah"
4732.400,4732.600," okay"
4733.200,4733.300," so"
4734.800,4735.600," he gets to China"
4736.100,4737.300," tasked with that"
4739.500,4740.400," that Duty"
4740.800,4741.500," responsibility"
4742.500,4743.600," and early on"
4744.900,4745.800," he's he has a"
4746.600,4749.000," wonderful piece of Good Fortune in the mission"
4749.600,4750.200," which is that"
4750.800,4752.900," there's actually a sort of local King"
4754.100,4755.500," in the first"
4756.300,4759.000," part of China he reaches called emperor Wu"
4759.900,4762.200," and I guess it was an emperor of a small"
4762.900,4763.300," area"
4763.900,4765.600," an emperor Wu was a"
4766.400,4767.200," believer in"
4768.300,4772.300," Buddhism which had been making its way into China over the previous five centuries actually"
4773.100,4773.300," and"
4775.600,4777.000," he'd been sponsoring"
4777.900,4780.000," monks and nuns"
4780.600,4781.800," to practice it had been"
4782.700,4785.300," paying for the translation a lot of sanskrit"
4785.800,4786.900," texts into Chinese"
4787.600,4791.800," and so on there is it was really on board with this and then he heard about bodied armour"
4792.300,4794.500," a genuine practitioner who arrived"
4794.900,4796.000," and he immediately summoned"
4797.400,4799.100," and so buddy dharma shows up"
4799.500,4800.200," the court"
4801.400,4803.300," but it's kind of golden opportunity"
4804.100,4807.100," to spread the wonderful dharma you know"
4807.600,4809.000," and the The Empress says"
4809.900,4810.300," to him"
4811.200,4812.200," I have been"
4813.600,4814.100," funding"
4814.700,4816.700," Buddhism or these years I love it you know"
4817.300,4818.400," how much merit"
4819.000,4819.900," have I earned"
4821.800,4823.700," and bodied armour looks at him says"
4824.200,4824.800," none at all"
4826.300,4827.800," then the emperor says"
4831.200,4831.400," well"
4832.100,4833.100," he tries another attack"
4833.400,4835.600," what is the holiest teaching"
4836.200,4837.400," what is the highest truth"
4838.600,4839.500," but in our says"
4840.800,4841.500," no holiness"
4842.200,4842.500," at all"
4843.800,4844.500," vast"
4845.300,4845.800," and clear"
4849.900,4850.400," and then"
4851.000,4851.900," the emperor says"
4852.500,4853.300," well who are you"
4854.300,4855.400," standing in front of me"
4856.600,4857.500," but he says"
4858.800,4859.300," I don't know"
4861.400,4862.400," I don't know"
4863.800,4865.400," and that's come down as a coin"
4867.100,4867.600," who are you"
4868.600,4868.900," I"
4870.000,4870.100," don't"
4871.700,4872.200," no"
4874.100,4875.000," why doesn't he"
4877.500,4878.700," know what is what is"
4879.500,4880.000," I"
4881.000,4881.300," don't"
4883.300,4883.500," know"
4886.700,4887.300," what is that"
4892.900,4893.000," and"
4893.800,4894.300," he leaves"
4895.800,4896.800," so you know imagine"
4897.800,4899.900," I didn't know what would be equivalent somebody who's"
4901.300,4903.100," you know some passionate some"
4904.700,4907.400," I can't think of a good example I should just stop my head but you know"

5666.900,5668.100," kind of rest"
5670.000,5670.500," as well"
5683.700,5686.000," as if there's just nothing to figure out"

6567.500,6568.500," I'm actually going to"
6570.100,6571.800," take the plunge and read a little poem"
6572.400,6572.800," of mine"
6576.400,6577.500," which is about"
6578.000,6578.900," how"
6581.400,6581.700," how I"
6582.300,6582.900," sometimes"
6584.700,6586.000," switched on so sort of"
6586.500,6587.500," awareness wise"
6588.300,6588.500," and"
6589.300,6590.400," often times not"
6591.900,6593.700," and it's called the real me"
6594.200,6595.200," and"
6596.600,6597.300," I hope it will"
6597.900,6599.100," I hope it's self-explanatory"
6600.400,6602.600," the real me the real me"
6603.200,6603.800," moves"
6604.500,6605.100," slowly"
6606.100,6607.400," the real me moves"
6608.000,6608.500," slowly"
6609.100,6609.500," he looks"
6609.900,6612.500," he looks at things a long time"
6613.600,6614.100," until"
6614.800,6615.900," he understands"
6616.500,6617.400," what he's looking at"
6619.000,6621.200," like this morning in the se"
6621.800,6623.500," down of the broadbeach"
6624.300,6624.900," early"
6625.400,6626.400," when the sun"
6626.900,6628.800," was like a bright oil slick"
6629.000,6630.500," on the water and the water"
6630.900,6632.400," was dark purple"
6632.700,6633.200," almost"
6633.700,6634.000," black"
6634.900,6636.700," and the sun itself had just risen"
6637.300,6638.800," over the far rooftops"
6639.800,6641.200," and it was the Seas"
6641.500,6642.500," surface"
6643.300,6644.100," the seeming"
6644.600,6645.800," thickness of it"
6646.300,6647.900," like animal hide"
6648.700,6649.800," moving in his"
6650.200,6652.100," big slow rhythm"
6652.800,6653.600," that caught"
6654.100,6654.500," his"
6655.100,6655.500," attention"
6657.900,6659.600," it was the season's surface"
6660.300,6663.200," seaming thickness of it like animal hide"
6663.900,6666.600," moving in its big slow rhythm"
6667.000,6667.500," that caught"
6668.100,6668.800," his attention"
6669.500,6670.900," it seemed like a heavy"
6671.500,6672.200," blanket"
6672.800,6673.800," being shaken"
6674.200,6675.500," and slow motion"
6676.600,6677.500," it's colours"
6678.000,6679.800," and Folds lit"
6680.500,6681.500," by the morning sun"
6682.400,6683.400," he was enjoying"
6684.900,6686.300," learning about it"
6687.500,6688.600," when already"
6689.500,6690.600," we were showering off"
6691.200,6693.600," the sort of the public speaker"
6694.500,6695.800," and towering dry"
6696.200,6697.300," and getting in the car"
6697.900,6699.000," and into the traffic"
6699.400,6703.300," and he was still staring back trying to see the sea"
6703.800,6706.700," with the great light Risen across it"
6707.000,6708.000," was she wanted"
6708.500,6709.900," which wanted to show him"
6710.500,6711.600," who he really was"
6712.200,6713.700," and the world he was living in"
6714.400,6716.600," something he was always happy to learn"
6717.100,6718.500," again and again"
6719.100,6720.300," but someone else"
6721.400,6722.900," someone thought this"
6723.600,6724.400," heedless"
6725.300,6725.800," busy"
6727.400,6728.600," had already taken him away"
6734.200,6736.500," the real me"
6742.300,6743.200," the real me"
6744.600,6745.200," was looking"
6746.400,6747.700," at the Seas surface"
6749.000,6750.600," it seemed like a heavy blank"
6751.100,6755.700," shaken and slo-motion it's colors and Folds lit by the morning sun"
6756.200,6757.100," he was enjoying"
6757.800,6758.900," it learning about it"
6759.800,6761.000," and already we were"
6761.200,6762.000," showering off"
6762.500,6763.400," at the public speaker"
6764.100,6766.900," towing dry getting in the car into the traffic"
6767.700,6770.800," and he was still staring back trying to see the sea"
6771.300,6773.400," with the great light Risen across it"
6774.300,6776.900," which wanted to show him who he really was"
6777.900,6779.500," and the world he was living in"
6780.200,6783.600," something he was always happy to learn again"
6784.100,6784.900," and again"
6785.800,6786.800," but someone else"
6788.200,6788.700," thought this"
6789.400,6790.100," heedless"
6791.100,6791.500," busy"
6792.800,6793.900," had already taken away"
6798.900,6798.900," yeah"
6802.000,6804.200," I think that's clear yeah you get it it's"
6804.700,6805.200," yeah okay"
6808.700,6809.800," I'm an idiot basically"
6812.900,6816.000," I mean idiot I don't realise who I really am"
6817.900,6821.400," and what this world is that I'm being granted a chance to be in"
6822.900,6823.800," but sometimes"
6825.100,6825.600," sometimes"
6827.100,6828.200," sometimes I do"
6829.800,6831.600," if I just go a bit slower"
6832.500,6832.800," so"
6833.400,6834.600," I'm going to invite you now"
6835.500,6835.900," in"
6836.700,6837.100," a little"
6837.800,6839.500," period we had before lunch"
6839.900,6840.600," well"
6841.600,6843.900," break maybe lunch depends on your"
6844.600,6845.700," dietary program"
6846.500,6847.900," but for many of us it will be lunch"
6849.000,6850.400," I'd like to invite us to"
6851.400,6851.700," basically"
6853.800,6855.100," find a neighbor"
6855.800,6857.500," possibly someone you don't know"
6858.800,6861.000," also fine if you do"
6862.000,6864.400," but maybe preferably someone you don't know"
6865.200,6867.600," and just share with them back and forth"
6868.400,6868.600," and"
6869.400,6869.700," what"
6870.600,6871.600," helps you"
6872.400,6876.200," I mean this is just a moments glancing thinking about it just"
6876.500,6878.100," first thing that comes up off top of the head"
6879.400,6881.200," often the top of the head is the bottom of the heart"
6881.500,6884.500," actually the first thing is that come up are often the things we most need to"
6885.000,6887.100," talk about that we thought we would skip over"
6888.000,6891.500," but anyway about what most helps you on your"
6892.800,6894.000," meditative path"
6894.800,6896.600," and what doesn't help you"
6897.800,6899.600," but what might you change in order to"
6902.800,6903.400," move along"
6903.700,6905.500," it the way you might think you want to"
6906.500,6907.800," meditative path"
6909.400,6910.800," what helps you what"
6911.800,6913.100," perhaps in the zip"
6914.100,6914.100," so"
6914.800,6915.800," please have at it"
6916.300,6916.800," find a"
6917.900,6919.200," find a stranger in the night"
6920.400,6922.600," but we're going to have our lunch break now"
6923.000,6923.600," so um"
6924.700,6926.500," please either"
6927.900,6930.800," continue in the same vein if that's what you feel like doing"
6931.600,6932.000," or if you"
6932.600,6933.800," feel like you want to have a"
6934.700,6934.900," really"
6935.800,6936.200," a sort of"
6937.400,6939.200," more deeply contemplative day"
6939.700,6940.900," you know you can just take your"
6941.600,6943.400," whether you've got a patent lunch or whether you've"
6943.700,6946.400," you're going to get one from the many nearby cafes and so on"
6947.300,6949.500," just you know of course do it quietly and"
6950.400,6951.400," eat mindfully"
6952.200,6953.400," if that's what you want to do"
6954.300,6956.900," and if you want to keep chatting chat mindfully"
6958.600,6959.800," and we'll reconvene"
6960.900,6962.500," in a couple of hours at two oclock"
6964.100,6964.600," okay"
6965.000,6966.700," thank you all very very much indeed"
6967.100,6969.200," for your great practice and for being here"
6970.000,6971.400," and being very present here"
6972.100,6972.800," it's wonderful"
6973.600,6975.700," I'm actually I'm really thrilled to be"
6976.700,6977.700," able to be with you"
6978.300,6980.600," and it's just doing my practice of power of good and"
6982.100,6982.400," really"
6984.000,6984.100," yeah"
6984.800,6985.600," really enjoying"
6986.100,6987.500," what it is to be quiet"
6988.200,6988.500," together"
6989.200,6991.500," and as and chat away together as well"
6992.100,6992.400," okay"
6992.800,6993.200," see you in a bit"
6995.300,6997.100," I mean the the challenge is only"
6998.000,6999.800," in that it's it's just so simple"
7003.300,7003.700," it's not"
7004.100,7006.000," simple in some fancy I don't"
7006.500,7007.800," when I say simple I don't mean"
7009.100,7014.000," what a simple but it man is this this is ridiculous you know you're going to find it hard to be this simple"
7015.200,7016.400," I mean it really isn't"
7017.600,7018.800," hard it really is"
7021.400,7022.700," so let's let's let's let's do a bit"
7024.200,7025.000," without doing anything"
7040.900,7041.100," so"
7043.600,7044.800," yeah first thing"
7045.500,7046.600," is to get comfortable"
7048.300,7049.800," you might be leaning back and"
7050.900,7051.900," receiving the"
7052.400,7053.600," support of your chair"
7054.400,7055.200," and you might be"
7055.800,7056.700," sitting up right"
7058.000,7059.700," with a free spine"
7061.700,7062.400," and finding"
7063.300,7063.700," balance"
7066.600,7067.500," finding balance"
7071.200,7072.200," remember those boys"
7073.700,7075.400," and girls actually as well"
7076.000,7079.000," and some adults that I mentioned on the beach in Venezuela"
7079.800,7080.300," who were just"
7081.600,7083.000," just enjoying"
7085.100,7085.500," being"
7087.400,7088.000," still"
7090.000,7090.900," being quiet"
7093.100,7094.200," allowing themselves"
7095.600,7096.300," a pause"
7100.100,7100.600," you know with"
7102.300,7105.400," maybe in some ways all had a hard coming of it"
7113.100,7113.800," and here we are"
7116.500,7117.200," gathered"
7118.200,7118.700," just"
7122.300,7123.100," to be quiet"
7128.800,7131.200," one of my zen teachers used to say"
7132.800,7133.300," really"
7134.200,7134.700," we just"
7135.000,7135.400," listen"
7199.400,7200.100," alright Steve"
7202.100,7204.800," resting in awareness of being"
7205.100,7205.400," here"
7208.300,7210.100," and awareness of hearing"
7225.000,7225.500," hearing"
7246.700,7249.100," and he sends the presence of the body"
7249.500,7249.700," the"
7252.100,7253.500," signature of"
7254.800,7256.900," a presence of the body kind of"
7257.700,7258.200," perhaps"
7258.500,7260.000," past vibratory or"
7261.000,7263.400," almost like a little light buzz"
7264.800,7266.500," or whom or glow"
7268.200,7268.900," all through"
7270.700,7272.000," basically the space"
7272.800,7273.800," by the body is"
7291.600,7292.400," stay"
7292.500,7293.800," resting with the body"
7383.100,7384.300," as also some"
7384.700,7385.300," seeing"
7386.700,7388.000," light and dark"
7390.200,7391.000," perhaps colours"
7394.000,7396.500," whether eyes are open or closed there's some"
7397.100,7397.600," seeing"
7405.800,7406.900," is there our primary"
7408.200,7408.800," outward"
7409.200,7411.700," sends experiences when my meditating"
7412.900,7414.100," see him hearing"
7415.200,7416.100," sensing the body"
7421.900,7423.100," collectively they"
7425.100,7428.000," are kind of our interface with the world"
7431.700,7433.300," outward"
7435.200,7436.300," sense experience"
7437.400,7439.100," and how in the right you to"
7440.400,7442.400," try using a little label"
7443.400,7443.800," out"
7445.900,7449.300," so every few seconds in the mind say it yourself"
7450.800,7451.000," out"
7453.000,7454.500," a little label out"
7455.800,7456.100," is"
7458.100,7460.000," a reminder to be aware"
7460.900,7461.900," of the outer"
7463.000,7463.600," sense"
7464.500,7467.800," channels one or two or all of them but doesn't matter"
7469.800,7470.400," how to"
7555.600,7556.300," out"
7558.100,7559.000," how to"
7559.300,7560.800," facing experience"
7570.900,7574.700," maybe you might start to sense that there's a whole"
7576.300,7576.600," I know"
7577.400,7578.700," space of awareness"
7580.300,7581.000," in which"
7583.000,7585.900," all those outward channels arise"
7588.300,7589.800," and the some kind of way"
7591.600,7593.400," it's as if the seeing"
7593.900,7596.100," outward the hearing outward"
7597.200,7599.300," and the feeling or sensing of the body"
7601.400,7602.000," are all"
7602.900,7604.300," assets of one"
7606.900,7609.300," outwardly oriented awareness"
7613.700,7614.200," out"
7701.200,7702.600," no don't worry"
7703.000,7706.100," so too much about doing this very exactly"
7707.800,7709.500," see what it's like to keep"
7711.100,7711.800," peating"
7713.000,7715.300," in your mind that little label"
7715.900,7717.800," every few seconds Out"
7718.900,7720.600," is a gentle encouragement"
7723.200,7724.500," to keep coming back to"
7725.600,7726.800," seeing hearing"
7727.200,7727.500," or"
7728.900,7729.900," sensing the body"
7732.600,7734.900," or somehow all of them together"
7737.200,7737.500," now"
7807.000,7810.300,"if you're getting sleepy that's just fine let yourself"
7810.700,7812.800," both fighter that is of b"
7813.500,7814.200," sleeping"
7828.600,7829.500," yeah if yeah"
7830.800,7833.600," still on it with the meditation we're going to bring in"
7835.000,7836.000," awareness"
7837.200,7840.000," of the other kind of great system"
7841.500,7841.800," in our"
7842.500,7844.300," experience which is the inward"
7844.900,7848.200," system basically it's thoughts and feelings"
7850.500,7854.200," and we we want to try to see if we can be aware"
7855.200,7858.600," of when we're engaging in the inner system"
7859.700,7860.100," thoughts"
7861.200,7862.700," and or feelings"
7865.900,7866.400," and when we're"
7868.100,7868.700," drawn"
7869.000,7870.800," into the outward system"
7871.600,7873.700," so we have a second label in"
7876.000,7878.600," we can just use that when"
7879.900,7881.600," we realise we've been"
7883.100,7884.500," occupied by"
7884.700,7885.300," thoughts"
7887.800,7889.400," and the inner system"
7890.000,7891.000," has been active"
7892.000,7892.800," and has kind of"
7893.600,7894.600," captivated us"
7895.500,7898.200," picked us up as the problem with that at all"
7899.000,7900.000," totally natural"
7901.800,7902.900," and let's see if we can"
7904.200,7905.000," recognise it"
7905.500,7906.500," just say in"
7908.700,7909.400," your mind"
7910.700,7912.300," and start to notice"
7915.600,7915.700," whether"
7918.000,7919.900," the inner system or"
7921.400,7921.600," the"
7922.700,7923.300," outward"
7923.900,7924.200," system"
7930.900,7931.300," and if"
7932.300,7935.300," it just want to rest in peace that's okay too"
7937.200,7937.900," just be"
8207.800,8208.500," and"
8210.300,8211.000," out"
8217.000,8218.500," sometimes in"
8227.900,8229.000," and sometimes out"
8240.800,8242.800," they be starting to rest"
8245.100,8245.400," in"
8246.000,8246.700," a single"
8247.200,8247.900," awareness"
8250.500,8251.400," one word that's"
8256.700,8257.900," that includes both"
8260.100,8260.400," one"
8263.400,8264.300," one away this"
8285.500,8288.700," is there a way that could be one awareness that includes"
8290.100,8291.200," body Sensation"
8291.900,8293.000," includes"
8294.300,8295.800," the whole soundscape"
8297.700,8301.200," includes the thoughts when their eyes and includes"
8301.900,8303.400," feelings emotions"
8304.500,8305.900," when they arise and one"
8306.800,8307.400," whole"
8308.600,8309.800," all-inclusive"
8311.300,8311.700," awareness"
8419.500,8421.800," and his last few minutes just"
8423.200,8424.000," but having you"
8425.000,8426.700," feel is most restful"
8427.000,8427.500," for you"
8431.000,8432.900," if you like you can drop all"
8434.300,8436.400," all attempts at any kind of practice"
8439.100,8440.300," no practice at all"
8601.800,8602.400,"you can"
8603.600,8605.100," roll on keep on"
8605.400,8605.900," if you want"
8606.300,8607.300," and you can also"
8609.700,8610.000," start"
8612.700,8613.900," sort of"
8615.800,8616.500," coming back"
8617.100,8617.300," to"
8619.000,8623.100," where we are but see actually if you can do that and"
8624.400,8627.400," just stay in exactly the same awareness that you may have"
8628.500,8630.100," possibly found or whatever"
8631.100,8634.200," state you're in is actually completely transportable"
8635.000,8637.700," it doesn't have to be like we stopped meditating and"
8638.500,8639.200," we have to switch"
8639.900,8640.300," awareness"
8641.100,8642.400," of whatever kind we may have found"
8643.000,8643.300," off"
8644.000,8645.200," not not a bit of it"
8646.200,8647.000," it's completely"
8648.400,8650.700," our own really so it can come with us"
8651.900,8653.200," all the time when we're walking"
8654.500,8656.100," when we're talking when we're listening"
8657.100,8659.500," when we're looking around a room full of other people"
8660.200,8660.900," it's perfectly"
8662.700,8663.200," amenable"
8664.300,8664.800," to just"
8666.300,8667.100," stay right here"
8668.000,8669.500," being right here with us you know"
8671.500,8671.800," okay"
8683.700,8686.100," so let's um let's have another"
8687.000,8690.500," little um sort of breakout moment when you can"
8691.500,8691.800," find"
8692.400,8693.900," a neighbor or two"
8694.200,8695.000," could be groups of"
8696.100,8696.900," two is"
8698.000,8700.500," is fine and actually through if it happens to"
8700.900,8702.100," all that way as fine as well"
8703.000,8703.700," just um"
8704.500,8706.000," see how you naturally"
8706.500,8707.000," cluster"
8707.700,8709.700," and let's have a let's have a chance for"
8710.400,8712.900," everybody in that cluster to say something about"
8715.400,8718.500," you know what what what what you most want from"
8720.100,8721.700," either your meditation practice"
8722.100,8724.000," what you would most want from it"
8725.600,8726.400," or if you're"
8727.900,8728.200," kind of"
8729.000,8729.100," not"
8729.600,8734.400," one of the people here whose deeply so that into the meditative path not sure they're really want one"
8735.100,8736.700," what might he want from"
8737.400,8738.400," a part of meditation"
8739.400,8740.700," just let's see what comes out"
8741.600,8742.000," okay so"
8742.600,8743.300," about 10 minutes"
8758.500,8760.800,"so we're going to do something a little bit more complicated now"
8761.100,8763.200," which is that I really would love to hear from"
8764.000,8764.800," any of you"
8766.000,8768.000," anything that came up and then you're happy to share"
8768.500,8769.900," and now has a"
8771.400,8772.300," roaming mic"
8772.900,8776.100," and actually this one can roam as well so now why don't we post to it"
8777.000,8781.100," so anybody if you'd like to just share something about what came up"
8781.900,8782.900," with with that question"
8784.200,8786.500," just raise a hand or will be on you with a mic"
8789.200,8790.400," okay"
8793.900,8796.700," but you can shout out if you're happy to ya or speak loudly"
8803.100,8809.000," all right so when I meditate stuff it's just understanding myself better like trying to understand my triggers or"
8809.500,8812.600," being aware that I feel as a certain way even though I don't know why"
8813.400,8818.400," okay great thank you that was did you all hear that yeah and zoom no"
8818.800,8820.100," okay there is being"
8820.400,8821.400," being aware"
8821.800,8822.100," of"
8823.200,8823.900," triggers"
8824.400,8826.200," and also being aware of how"
8826.500,8827.100," you're feeling"
8827.500,8827.900," yeah"
8828.200,8829.800," so that's lovely that would be"
8830.500,8831.900," in the labeling system"
8832.700,8834.400," that that last year that would be"
8835.100,8835.600," inward"
8836.000,8836.300," system"
8837.000,8837.900," being more aware of it"
8838.400,8839.400," how I guess triggered"
8839.800,8841.600," I was what is actually going on"
8842.100,8842.600," inwardly"
8842.900,8844.300," great thank you anybody else"
8845.400,8847.000," yep I've got one right here"
8849.400,8851.400," I think all of us agreed creating more space"
8852.500,8854.400," to be able to go more and where it and"
8855.100,8856.900," and the way you behave outward"
8857.900,8859.600," or interact outward lovely"
8860.100,8862.300," everybody here that's I think yeah"
8863.300,8864.000," anybody else"

8876.700,8879.800," well that's it something very similar we said that"
8880.800,8881.300," we'd like to"
8882.000,8883.100," sort of understand this truth"
8883.900,8884.100," you know"
8884.900,8885.800," be ashamed to"
8886.700,8888.400," reach the end of life and not sort of"
8889.700,8890.700," experience"
8891.300,8891.900," at least"
8894.000,8894.700," what is real"
8895.200,8895.500," you know"
8896.200,8898.500," because everyone talks about that so"
8899.800,8900.100," yeah"

8917.600,8917.900," I'd like to"
8919.000,8923.700," experience what like a no self experience feels like because it's something that I've heard about and I can sort of"
8924.400,8929.000," you know intellectually understand like why that might be the case for how it might be by one and know what what does that feel like"
8929.900,8930.000," yeah"
8934.900,8935.600," anybody else"
8937.500,8941.000," okay I think now it's going there's two over here now so one two yeah"
8941.800,8943.800," I think myself searching for"
8944.500,8946.500," a grounding equanimity"
8948.100,8949.400," to be grounded in"
8949.900,8951.000," have a sense of balance"
8952.200,8953.100," before thanks"
8956.200,8956.900," now over here"

8961.600,8964.500,"I was so tired my mother I was ready for it and"
8966.300,8971.100," I think what came up for us three was some of the common themes were"
8971.800,8973.200," I want to be intimate with life"
8975.200,8977.200," on a bit as close to it as possible really"
8978.500,8979.900," not be a removed from it"
8983.600,8984.400," just really live it"
8986.600,8987.300," because close to it"
8989.200,8990.000," only thank you"
8991.700,8991.800," yeah"

9005.700,9007.800," I didn't see many put the hand up"
9008.900,9012.800," because we came from wccm worldwide community of Christian meditators"
9014.300,9015.400," I would love to say"
9017.000,9020.000," that I feel the Holy Spirit with me and within me"
9021.000,9022.000," and this meditation"
9022.700,9023.900," increases this feeling"
9024.600,9025.600," and makes me at peace"
9026.100,9027.100," and I would love to say"
9027.900,9028.800," that god helps"
9029.800,9030.700," lovely thank you"
9031.800,9031.900," great"
9034.900,9035.700," maybe one more"
9036.300,9036.800," anybody else"
9040.000,9040.200," yeah"
9041.800,9048.300," well when this question comes up about what you're trying to get from meditation I always go back to something that one of my teachers Valerie"
9049.500,9050.900," said to me said well really"
9051.400,9054.100," you're trying to address the great matter of life and death"
9056.200,9059.700," and I think it doesn't get any more comprehensive than that really for me"
9061.300,9062.400," a great matter yeah"
9063.600,9064.700," well that was okay yeah"
9067.100,9070.300," just to add to that I should particular reference to the great matter of debt"
9072.200,9073.500," of the death"
9074.800,9075.000," okay"
9075.700,9076.000," great"
9077.400,9079.700," well thanks thanks very much for sharing"
9081.900,9083.800," so basically we had sort of a"
9084.900,9085.500," Spectrum"
9086.000,9086.200," from"
9088.300,9089.100," one side"
9089.500,9089.800," of"
9090.300,9090.500," the"
9092.300,9095.500," what a set sorry just with myself and let me just introduce a little"
9096.200,9099.300," notion to you there's an old Chinese document"
9100.100,9101.400," from the 6th century"
9103.100,9103.700," CE"
9104.400,9107.200," that wasn't found until mid 20th century"
9107.800,9108.400," there's a huge"
9109.200,9110.100," trove"
9110.400,9113.800," I think that's a word of documents that was discovered in his caves in China"
9114.500,9117.100," and the early 20th century had done Wong"
9117.600,9119.300," and there was such a vast cash"
9120.000,9121.600," or Trove of documents that"
9122.100,9123.700," there's still haven't finished going through the more"
9124.400,9125.600," so even though they were found"
9126.800,9130.500," I forget 80 years ago or something that's still coming to light and just"
9131.100,9131.800," in the last"
9133.400,9137.900," are not exactly sure maybe last 40 years so particular document came to life"
9138.800,9140.900," among a set that was in this huge"
9142.800,9143.100," field"
9144.200,9145.300," Stash in this cave"
9145.800,9146.200," that was"
9147.200,9151.600," about a particular line of early Buddhism in China"
9152.400,9154.200," and in one of the documents in that"
9156.300,9156.500," but"
9157.200,9158.900," there was one that talked about"
9159.800,9161.100," practice being"
9161.700,9162.800," a wagon Trail"
9163.700,9164.900," or a car track"
9165.800,9167.300," and the car track has two"
9168.000,9168.300," routes"
9170.100,9171.000," 1 3 the wheel"
9171.900,9173.000," and one wheel"
9174.100,9175.300," is called"
9176.700,9177.900," both foundations of mindfulness"
9179.200,9179.600," so in"
9180.100,9181.400," one wheel rut"
9181.800,9183.200," one of The Ruts on the track"
9183.700,9185.100," is called mindfulness"
9185.800,9186.900," okay just for simplicity"
9187.700,9189.500," and the other one is called"
9190.600,9191.400," reality"
9193.200,9193.400," so"
9194.000,9194.200," the"
9195.000,9195.600," first one"
9196.500,9198.300," is what we can cultivate"
9198.700,9200.200," is what we can work on"
9200.700,9204.500," it's what we can learn to have more of"
9205.000,9205.600," like"
9206.100,9208.600," awareness of our triggers and how we're"
9209.200,9212.700," how we're doing and getting to know our actual experience Here and Now"
9213.400,9214.700," and de-stressing"
9215.300,9218.200," and actually dialing down the nervous system"
9218.800,9222.000," because it's so critical because the nervous system is actually"
9222.900,9225.400," the means by which we experience life"
9226.500,9229.000," so the nervous system isn't an add-on"
9229.800,9232.800," is absolutely in a middle of how we experience life"
9233.600,9235.000," so to be more intimate with life"
9235.800,9237.100," right on to be"
9237.800,9238.600," more"
9239.200,9244.000," have more equanimity to be more grounded to be less reactive to know our triggers"
9245.100,9246.000," all of"
9246.600,9248.100," that called happen"
9248.500,9251.600," if we don't sort of know our nervous system"
9252.600,9256.200," we won't know I am and when I started meditating I had no idea"
9256.900,9260.000," how fraught and friends it and crazy I really was"
9260.500,9266.100," you know it was only once I started meditating that I mean when I started meditating I know some of you have read my books so"
9266.500,9268.200," I won't I won't go on about this long but"
9269.000,9272.300," when I first started and meditating in Earnest at the age of 24"
9273.100,9274.100," I slept for a week"
9274.800,9275.700," 20 hours a day"
9276.400,9278.200," and I thought I was getting sick"
9278.500,9279.100," actually there"
9279.900,9280.300," there was"
9281.000,9283.800," in London at the time this is late eighties was the first"
9284.800,9292.700," time that the the thing called chronic syndrome chronic fatigues in them was really active you know people started talking about it"
9293.200,9294.800," and here in England they called it any"
9296.000,9298.200," did he ever I don't know if any of you remember that"
9298.800,9299.400," and if"
9300.000,9300.200," so"
9301.700,9305.900," there have been pressed about I didn't have it I was mercifully but"
9307.000,9312.600," they've been pressed about the cure for it one cure that seemed to help with it"
9313.000,9314.800," was transcendental meditation"
9315.400,9317.700," TM and that's what I started doing"
9318.500,9318.700," and"
9319.300,9319.900," I got this"
9321.100,9324.700," it just extraordinary level asleep in this"
9325.100,9326.500," once I started meditating"
9327.900,9333.200," and I thought oh no those oh there's some connection between TM and em am I getting me"
9333.500,9333.600," you know"
9334.200,9334.600," but actually"
9335.200,9337.700," on the seventh morning after I started"
9338.800,9344.800," when I you know I got up I have my cup of coffee and slice of toast or whatever and I was going I was doing a"
9345.900,9350.700," I was trying to do a postgraduate degree that ultimately I a PhD that ultimate our banded"
9351.000,9352.500," at the time so I had a fairly"
9353.300,9354.400," well sometimes flexible"
9355.700,9357.900," schedule by put my eyes you know stuff in my little"
9358.500,9359.100," book bag"
9360.600,9361.300," expecting"
9362.000,9365.100," to be fooled by exhaustion halfway to the tube"
9365.600,9367.900," station which had been-- happening in the previous six months"
9368.600,9369.400," and this morning"
9370.900,9372.400," I got out of the flap"
9373.200,9374.700," and it was a rainy"
9375.600,9376.400," miserable"
9377.000,9377.300," day"
9377.800,9378.300," in London"
9379.000,9379.400," and it was"
9380.100,9380.900," so beautiful"
9382.100,9382.900," it was just like"
9384.900,9385.700," waking up"
9386.400,9387.300," into the world"
9388.700,9389.900," in all its beauty"
9390.500,9392.500," and it just didn't matter if it was raining"
9393.200,9395.800," Grace guys it was so beautiful"
9396.300,9397.300," and I was Fresh"
9398.300,9399.300," and I was like a"
9399.900,9401.000," you know and I felt"
9401.900,9403.400," I felt like a Snowdrop"
9404.100,9405.500," there's just come up in spring"
9406.100,9406.800," that pure"
9408.000,9409.600," and clear you know really"
9412.100,9413.100," and that is"
9413.700,9418.400," that was I think I take that to be my own first- taste of what it was like"
9419.600,9420.400," to at last"
9420.900,9422.000," have a nervous system"
9422.500,9423.400," in better shape"
9424.700,9427.800," because the nervous system is the means by which we meet"
9428.700,9429.100," the world"
9429.600,9429.900," basically"
9431.300,9432.400," so it matters"
9433.100,9433.900," if we care"
9434.300,9435.000," about life"
9435.800,9438.600," it matters and by the way the great matter of death"
9439.300,9440.100," is here"
9440.600,9441.100," right"
9441.700,9443.900," now it is just the matter of life"
9444.700,9445.500," it's all it is"
9446.000,9446.900," there is no death"
9447.300,9449.600," actually I just read of marvelous essay"
9450.100,9451.500," that I can't share any"
9452.200,9455.000," with this under wraps but it has a great line in it"
9455.500,9457.400," death always happens to someone else"
9459.200,9460.500," and it builds from that"
9462.000,9464.200," the delusion of that and the truth of it"
9464.500,9464.800," as well"
9465.500,9466.700," but anyway death"
9467.800,9467.900," is"
9468.400,9471.900," this very moment is the great matter"
9472.800,9473.300," of Life"
9474.000,9474.600," and therefore"
9475.200,9475.700," of death"
9476.500,9477.000," of death"
9477.500,9478.200," and therefore"
9479.100,9480.500," of life is only"
9481.300,9481.500," here"
9482.400,9483.400," is only here"
9484.300,9484.900," that we find"
9487.300,9489.300," the question or matter of death"
9490.400,9491.000," resolved"
9491.800,9492.700," and it can be"
9493.700,9494.500," but it can be"
9495.400,9498.600," in the mysterious way of these things not with an answer"
9500.500,9501.400," not with an answer"
9502.900,9504.200," but like I was saying"
9504.700,9505.100," earlier"
9505.800,9507.100," it's about undoing"
9507.800,9512.400," and so I'm going a little I know I'm skating around a bit widely here but it is actually all"
9512.900,9513.800," around one thing"
9514.500,9514.600," but"
9515.900,9516.600," the great matter"
9517.500,9518.400," of life and death"
9519.100,9519.200," is"
9520.200,9520.400," just"
9521.400,9521.700," here"
9522.500,9523.800," and what it takes to"
9524.900,9525.200," sort of"
9526.200,9526.800," solve it"
9527.200,9529.800," is that it can't be solved there's no need to solve it"
9530.100,9533.800," doesn't matter about solving it there's nothing to answer nothing to solve nothing to resolve"
9534.400,9535.200," there's just"
9536.500,9537.700," the undoing"
9538.500,9542.400," a certain kind of undoing that I was talking about with the bits of string"
9542.800,9543.800," untying"
9544.600,9545.300," releasing"
9545.900,9546.400," letting go"
9548.700,9550.400," okay so to take"
9551.100,9552.100," first contract"
9552.700,9556.800," first wheel rock of the cartridge second wheel of the car track"
9557.500,9557.800," is"
9558.500,9559.000," chrono quote"
9559.500,9560.100," reality"
9560.700,9561.700," some taught about that"
9562.200,9565.100," I want to find what there is to find a wanna find the truth"
9565.800,9566.900," big tea or small tea"
9567.400,9569.800," I want to find what all this is I want to find reality"
9571.100,9571.900," I hear about it"
9573.200,9574.100," people talk about it"
9576.300,9579.300," and it is actually one of the features of"
9581.000,9582.500," is one of the features of"
9583.700,9586.700," is a terrible label non-dual experience"
9588.400,9592.400," that you feel when you encounter it that it's more"
9593.300,9593.600," real"
9594.900,9595.800," whatever this is"
9596.400,9597.800," that we might ordinarily"
9598.900,9599.000," be"
9599.900,9603.300," calling our life when we drop into the non-dual"
9604.100,9605.500," where the census self"
9606.100,9606.300," is"
9608.900,9610.700," I was going to say seen through"
9612.600,9614.900," but we'll do for now because I'm"
9615.400,9617.000," the language is really tricky here because"
9617.700,9618.900," it is not experienced"
9619.500,9621.000," that has language one of the"
9621.500,9621.800," Great"
9622.400,9623.200," features of it"
9623.600,9624.700," is it cannot"
9625.200,9625.300," be"
9626.000,9626.700," described"
9627.600,9629.800," it cannot be put into words"
9630.300,9631.600," you can't know it"
9632.300,9633.600," the way we can know"
9634.400,9635.000," anything else"
9636.000,9638.100," you can't know it that way"
9639.300,9639.900," so then"
9641.700,9643.600," is always well not always it often"
9644.100,9645.900," talking about not knowing"
9646.800,9647.700," meaning basically"
9648.400,9649.200," more of that"
9649.900,9650.500," UN"
9652.600,9655.100," so do less including"
9655.500,9656.000," knowing"
9656.500,9657.500," less of"
9658.200,9658.700," knowing"
9659.700,9660.800," less of it"
9661.800,9662.400," less"
9664.800,9666.200," and that undone does"
9666.800,9667.100," us"
9669.000,9670.600," we get undone"
9672.700,9673.600," it's beautiful"
9674.800,9676.600," because we don't need to be done"
9677.900,9678.800," we think we do"
9679.100,9680.300," but we don't"
9681.200,9681.900," and if we just"
9683.800,9684.800," undo"
9686.400,9687.300," the self just"
9687.800,9688.700," unders"
9689.600,9690.100," itself"
9693.600,9693.800," and"
9695.600,9697.800," it's all here already it's it wasn't"
9698.800,9699.600," it wasn't some"
9701.000,9702.000," can I conquer the"
9702.500,9703.400," the summit you"
9704.400,9705.400," top of the Mountain"
9705.800,9706.000," you know"
9706.700,9709.100," actually no it's it's just here"
9712.900,9714.400," but I like the way that"
9714.800,9718.900," I thought all the answers or answers wasn't the right word all they expressions"
9719.600,9720.600," were beautiful"
9721.200,9723.900," every single one of them is right on target"
9725.300,9725.900," exactly"
9726.600,9726.800," what"
9728.100,9731.100," I think for one of a better word human's spirituality"
9732.400,9732.600," I'm"
9733.700,9734.200," kind of is"
9734.700,9736.000," at the heart is really about"
9740.100,9742.200," okay I'm going to do one thing before"
9743.300,9746.700," we hear my talking about not doing I'm going to do one thing"
9747.200,9749.200," before we have a little bit of an afternoon break"
9751.500,9752.000," because it"
9753.100,9754.100," I hope you'll sort of"
9755.800,9760.900," be a full bearing with me or whatever and patient with me I want to share another small poem"
9761.500,9762.100," of my own"
9762.800,9767.500," and the the justification that I'm giving myself for doing it"
9768.000,9771.000," is that the three little micro conversations I had at lunch"
9771.900,9772.800," I mean they were just"
9773.400,9774.800," very briefly changes were"
9775.300,9779.800," we're all about different kinds of hardship that come up and"
9782.200,9783.900," there are all three were different"
9784.400,9785.600," forms of the kinds of"
9787.800,9789.400," innocence unresolvable"
9790.000,9792.000," hardships that we Face losses"
9793.600,9795.500," Grievous things happening to loved ones"
9796.600,9798.000," perhaps to ourselves as well"
9799.300,9799.500," and"
9801.000,9802.900," it's it's suddenly reminded me"
9803.900,9807.900," everything that you know I I kind of think I know but I somehow obviously forget"
9808.700,9811.100," which is when I was talking earlier about this"
9812.100,9817.800," this this thing that isn't a thing you know this space we could kind of call it in awareness"
9818.500,9820.200," it's a it's a way of being"
9821.200,9822.100," that we feel"
9823.300,9825.300," the heart as a gateway to"
9825.900,9831.800," but it's maybe not the only one but it's a it's a state but it's not really a state it's a"
9832.100,9834.800," an awareness it's not exactly in awareness"
9835.400,9836.400," I don't know what to call it"
9837.100,9840.100," but it's it's what this practice is really for"
9841.000,9842.300," you know and when we when we"
9844.900,9846.200," when we find it"
9849.000,9849.300," we are"
9850.900,9851.800," we know we've found"
9853.900,9854.800," an unconditional"
9857.000,9857.500," well-being"
9858.900,9860.600," we found an unconditional"
9861.400,9862.100," okayness"
9864.200,9865.600," it's not dependent on"
9866.500,9868.300," having the things I think I want"
9869.900,9871.300," it's almost as if"
9872.400,9875.700," it's kind of almost dependent on letting go of them"
9875.800,9876.100," of that"
9877.900,9880.600," the release of The Pursuit"
9881.500,9885.200," of the things I think I want to find including it"
9886.500,9888.800," as long as we're trying to find it"
9889.700,9890.400," somehow"
9892.200,9893.600," it seems to be obscured"
9894.400,9895.900," when we're not trying to find"
9896.300,9896.800," anything"
9898.800,9899.400," it can come"
9900.800,9901.800," could it's already here"
9903.200,9904.200," you know they're saying then"
9904.800,9908.900," there's a famous little dialogue zen is the few of you who are will know"
9909.700,9913.800," this great master when is a young student he goes to his teacher and says"
9914.900,9915.800," what is"
9916.300,9916.900," the way"
9917.500,9922.900," and this case the way means something like that second wheel right reality what is it"
9923.600,9924.700," and the master answers"
9926.900,9927.500," ordinary"
9927.900,9928.300," mind"
9928.900,9929.300," is the way"
9929.800,9931.300," you're ordinary experience"
9932.000,9932.400," is the way"
9933.700,9935.800," then the Bright Young student says"
9937.400,9939.500," should I turn to Wards it"
9940.300,9940.700," or not"
9941.300,9942.800," should I try and find it"
9943.300,9943.800," or not"
9944.500,9945.600," and his teacher says"
9946.700,9949.600," if you try to find it you're going against it"
9950.800,9951.300," well what"
9952.700,9956.300," WTF you know what's supposed to do I want to find this thing"
9956.800,9960.400," no know if you're trying to find it yes you do but if you try to find it"
9961.000,9965.900," you're not you're going the wrong way what should I not try to find it no not really not that either"
9967.000,9967.800," well it's supposed to do"
9971.300,9973.600," if you turn to towards it you're going to against it"
9974.000,9975.300," and they see what well how will I know"
9975.800,9976.300," if I find it"
9977.200,9980.900," and he's then he says it's it's beyond knowing and not know"
9983.900,9985.700," you can't you can't mistake it"
9986.800,9988.500," but it's beyond knowing and not know"
9989.600,9991.200," I can't be expressed anyway enough that"
9991.900,9992.600," but the point being"
9997.400,9999.800," yeah we're not trying to find it or we won't let it"
10000.100,10001.000," but here's the thing"
10002.600,10003.900," this is the sort of"
10004.600,10008.200," appalachia fancy word what's the Independence of"
10010.200,10014.900," it's what these micro conversations will remind me that the one thing that"
10015.900,10016.400," maybe"
10017.400,10021.000," somewhat reliably can propel us"
10022.500,10023.000," into it"
10024.100,10024.300," is"
10024.900,10026.000," Grievous things"
10027.300,10028.000," that we don't want"
10029.500,10031.000," great hardships that we don't want"
10032.000,10033.300," so I've got a little poem"
10033.700,10034.600," that is called"
10035.000,10035.900," frozen Lake"
10037.000,10040.200," and actually it's the image in it is of a frozen Lake"
10041.600,10042.700," but it's got a"
10043.300,10047.500," what we call an epigraph which is like a little tiny phrase"
10048.300,10051.600," that it starts with just the quotation which is the broken ones"
10052.000,10053.400," are my beloved"
10054.500,10057.500," and that's from a little tiny snippet"
10058.200,10059.000," from a sufi"
10059.900,10060.300," master"
10062.200,10062.600," Sheikh"
10062.900,10063.900," abuse aid"
10064.600,10065.900," who actually called himself"
10066.500,10067.000," nobody"
10067.400,10068.900," son of nobody"
10070.200,10074.300," the broken runs are my beloved in fact the whole quote is God"
10075.200,10077.000," says or alarm says"
10077.400,10078.300," the broken ones"
10078.900,10079.500," and my beloved"
10080.700,10083.100," when I think a friend who have been through"
10083.800,10084.300," the worst"
10086.800,10087.500," the terrible"
10088.300,10088.600," sorry"
10090.000,10091.900," one of the downsides of my"
10093.600,10094.400," minor"
10094.600,10095.300," brain"
10097.700,10098.300," what's the word"
10098.800,10102.400," deficit compromised that I've had these last few years after a bike accident"
10102.800,10105.600," I'm just not as good as memorizing so I used to be that"
10105.900,10107.900," anyway not that I was ever that good at it but"
10108.600,10109.000," Louis"

10261.800,10262.200," needed"
10278.100,10281.300," and I suppose I mean actually let's talk about all of us"
10283.100,10283.800," we are all"
10285.800,10286.200," crossing"
10288.800,10289.900," and much more precarious"
10290.600,10293.000," making a much more precarious crossing"
10293.800,10295.400," than we commonly think we are"
10296.800,10297.400," I mean some"
10298.000,10300.100," get wise to it and realize is all"
10300.800,10301.700," precarious"
10303.000,10305.300," because they've been through something they've had"
10306.300,10306.900," the phone call"
10309.700,10311.200," they know what the phone can bring"
10312.900,10313.800," you know but"
10315.900,10317.400," some of us haven't had that yet"
10317.700,10317.800," you know"
10319.100,10321.400," we haven't had it yet and that's great it's not a problem"
10322.400,10326.500," but some gets smart I mean Buddha you know shaky money Buddha the"
10326.800,10328.300," story is he wise"
10328.700,10329.800," he got wise Young"
10331.100,10332.800," you know he he realised"
10333.600,10334.800," that even in his"
10335.800,10336.900," Palace of luxuries"
10337.900,10339.200," as the story goes"
10340.400,10343.800," really the luxury is and all the"
10346.300,10349.600," good things were in a sense distractions"
10350.300,10351.700," in a sense of Distraction"
10352.800,10353.000," from"
10354.100,10357.200," the reality that he was going the same way everybody's going"
10359.300,10359.400," no"
10359.900,10360.100," and"
10361.500,10364.000," I think now is of course we're celebration"
10364.900,10365.700," the fact that we are"
10366.700,10367.500," the fact that we"
10368.200,10368.600," are"
10370.600,10371.300," going to die"
10372.200,10375.800," and that everybody we know is going to die I think it's actually a Cause"
10376.400,10377.100," for living"
10379.300,10379.600," bully"
10380.200,10380.700," that's the"
10382.500,10384.800," traditionally and all these practices that's the big"
10386.200,10387.800," um well are"
10388.000,10388.800," steak"
10390.000,10390.700," it's"
10391.300,10392.000," it's just"
10392.800,10394.300," to get with this right now"
10395.500,10397.700," and you know and and and and we can"
10398.400,10399.300," mercifully we can"
10400.200,10401.000," you know and some"
10401.600,10403.500," find this kind of practice helps"
10405.000,10408.100," but if you can do it another way go right ahead you know it's not the only way"
10409.900,10410.600," but it's a good way"
10411.400,10413.200," and it's a it's a it's a fine way"
10413.600,10415.500," there's a noble way they used to say"
10416.600,10420.300," it's a largely we could send modern language it's a keystone habit"
10421.200,10424.400," in other words it's a habit that brings many good habits"
10425.000,10425.700," in its train"
10428.800,10431.400," people who meditate regularly depend to have"
10432.500,10434.200," kind of better habits all around"
10435.700,10439.800," that like exercise actually I think that's also keystone habit it's not the only one"
10444.100,10447.100," but this does address the the big matter"
10448.200,10448.700," in a way that"
10449.300,10449.900," not necessarily"
10451.800,10454.500," other form other things like exercise too"
10455.200,10456.600," I think we should do both probably"
10458.900,10460.300,"anyway we're gonna have a break now"
10460.700,10460.800," and"
10461.600,10461.900," let's see"
10463.100,10463.900," where we can bring"
10465.100,10466.300," spend the build as you will"
10467.500,10468.200," harmlessly"
10468.900,10474.100," and we'll reconvene in what should we just say 10 minutes is that okay do you think for"
10474.700,10477.000," as it were coming you know to our last little"
10477.600,10478.400," yeah 10 minutes"
10505.900,10511.100," so as we're all Gathering back in let's see if we can just drop"
10511.600,10511.900," into"
10514.300,10514.800," not doing"
10517.100,10518.500," just settle"
10519.200,10519.500," yourself"
10527.600,10528.900," come back to your seat"
10530.300,10531.900," literally and figuratively"
10538.000,10539.000," feeling the seat"
10542.900,10544.400," you know the same way that actually"
10545.800,10548.000," you know when we're gathering like this in a"
10548.500,10549.000," in a group"
10550.100,10551.300," there is a little bit of a"
10552.400,10555.200," sort of shuffling and getting back to the seats as we all"
10555.800,10556.100," Returned"
10557.200,10560.100," but let's something like that be happening within you"
10560.600,10562.300," all the different parts of you"
10563.500,10564.700," kind of shuffling back"
10567.100,10567.200," to"
10569.100,10571.100," this space of awareness"
10576.200,10576.800," I once"
10578.300,10579.900," sitting with tick that horn"
10580.200,10582.400," way back and one of the"
10583.500,10585.500," practice leaders he had said"
10586.800,10590.700," you know it's all very well sometimes people start meditating and they kind of"
10591.300,10594.600," shoot ahead and go very enthusiastic and have"
10595.300,10596.800," wonderful openings and things"
10599.400,10604.100," but actually that's just one of 50 people that they really are"
10605.600,10608.000," and the other 49 are still back there"
10608.500,10609.200," in a hudlow"
10610.500,10612.600," and it's more valuable"
10613.600,10614.800," if all 50"
10615.900,10616.900," take one step"
10619.500,10621.600," so that's when we always go slow"
10622.900,10623.800," in meditation"
10625.100,10625.300," we"
10626.200,10627.400," start slow"
10628.800,10629.800," we build slow"
10632.000,10634.900," giving all of all of all the ones that we are"
10636.400,10637.800," a chance to catch up"
10640.500,10642.800," we're not trying to race anywhere"
10644.500,10645.400," that we're not already"
10648.400,10650.200," so we're just resting here"
10653.600,10654.300," Gathering in"
10663.600,10664.200," listening"
10672.200,10673.700," rejoining the world"

10749.300,10751.400," it's fine to move mindfully"
10753.300,10754.200," but it's all good"

12003.200,12005.900," how do I know if I'm making progress in meditation"
12008.300,12010.100," and it was also mentioning sort of"
12011.100,12015.200," questions about performance and feeling like it's a chore"
12015.700,12018.700," in other words it's sort of a task to chip away and some way"
12020.200,12030.100," he has a great it's a great question I mean I think it's pointing a what is our attitude to it really and there could be various attitudes that we bring actually to it"
12034.900,12038.100," I mean it is it's it's like it is a journey"
12038.900,12040.300," you know it's like going on a journey"
12041.000,12042.000," across a continent"
12042.800,12044.700," and it's going to be lots of different things"
12045.500,12046.500," there's going to be times"
12046.900,12048.600," when it does feel like a chore"
12049.100,12050.300," and we don't particularly want to do it"
12050.900,12052.700," and there's a drag to fit it in"
12053.300,12057.600," and there's like I don't know the musical instrument when you were young"
12058.200,12062.700," but what that could feel like oh no I got to do piano practice now I'm going to skip it today you know"
12063.800,12064.200," but actually"
12065.300,12065.900," that's one"
12066.600,12068.500," thing that we may have to contend with"
12069.200,12069.700," at times"
12070.800,12071.700," other times"
12072.700,12073.300," it will be"
12074.100,12074.600," so"
12075.400,12076.000," fulfilling"
12077.200,12078.000," so beautiful"
12078.400,12078.700," but we"
12079.200,12082.000," we don't want to stop and we can't wait to get back to it"
12083.100,12083.900," other times"
12084.900,12085.700," it will be"
12087.600,12092.000," very interesting because we're curious something's going on and we want to"
12092.800,12095.800," see where it leads us we feel that we're on a trail of breadcrumbs"
12096.700,12097.800," and it's leading somewhere"
12099.000,12101.100," there may be phases when we've got some"
12102.700,12106.600," clothes guidance in our practice and that's another thing and there'll be"
12107.600,12113.000," phases when we don't so much have guidance we've got a really nice supportive community and that's another thing"
12114.000,12115.600," and they'll be times when"
12116.400,12118.600," we go through really difficult things"
12119.400,12123.100," and then it it will be something else again it'll either be"
12123.700,12125.300," in the face of great Grievous"
12125.700,12126.500," things it can be"
12127.200,12129.600," no I don't really want to sit so I have to feel this stuff"
12130.100,12130.900," or it can be"
12131.700,12133.000," only sitting help me"
12133.800,12135.500," only doing nothing helped me"
12136.900,12137.100," you know"
12137.500,12138.700," it's a whole journey"
12139.300,12139.400," and"
12142.100,12143.800," I wish I had a good answer"
12145.300,12146.600," I think there's something around"
12149.900,12150.400," progress"
12151.500,12153.800," I think that's probably one kind of progress"
12154.600,12157.900," that I could easily recognize I think which would be"
12158.900,12159.300," that"
12160.100,12163.100," the question of whether to do it has gone"
12164.100,12165.100," I'm just going to do it"
12166.100,12167.700," I think that is a kind of progress"
12170.300,12170.600," from"
12171.600,12173.800," you know I was listening that there was a book out"
12174.400,12178.100," I didn't know what happened to hear it on NPR about 10 years ago by two economists"
12179.000,12183.400," who were talking about dieting they had written a book on dieting these two economists"
12183.700,12185.100," I can't remember why but they had"
12185.700,12189.100," and their main point this is what I learned from NPR the"
12189.600,12194.300," Public Radio and the US just the randomly start with me because I thought it was a good point actually"
12195.000,12196.200," was Deeside"
12196.800,12197.700," that was the thing they said"
12198.200,12199.500," decide ones"
12199.800,12200.900," not lots of times"
12201.800,12204.900," in other words they made the decision that would not have dessert"
12205.900,12206.700," desert was off"
12207.800,12210.000," because they wanted to get fitter and trimmer or whatever"
12211.100,12211.300," so that"
12211.800,12212.800," one decision"
12213.400,12215.300," was made and they didn't have to make it"
12216.400,12218.100," 365 times in the year"
12219.000,12220.400," or twice that you know"
12221.100,12222.500," it's the same I think with meditation"
12223.000,12224.700," and we just made the decision"
12225.100,12225.800," I'm doing it"
12226.600,12228.000," so I don't have to make it every day"
12229.100,12230.300," you know I think that's that's"
12231.600,12233.000," a kind of progress"
12235.000,12235.600," of course"
12236.800,12240.500," you know on the basis of that can't track metaphor"
12240.700,12241.700," that I brought up earlier"
12242.700,12246.000," in each of those wheel rights you could say there's kinds of"
12246.600,12247.700," kinds of progress"
12248.300,12249.600," there is a kind of progress"
12251.900,12256.100," I mean there's so many kinds of heart you know where to get actually when I think about it"
12256.400,12258.300," with for example in my own case"
12258.900,12260.600," when I started meditating I was"
12261.100,12262.700," emotionally illiterate"
12263.300,12265.500," I didn't understand emotions really"
12266.000,12267.800," somehow I'd reach the age of 24 with"
12268.500,12269.600," not really knowing"
12270.000,12270.500," it was either"
12271.500,12273.700," I felt quite good and I was okay"
12274.800,12275.400," or I felt"
12275.900,12277.300," shity and I was bad"
12278.000,12281.900," you know it was basically one of the and I didn't know what the factors were or anything"
12283.000,12286.800," and I had a lot of shame attached to feeling back actually and then gradually"
12288.100,12289.000," remove meditation"
12289.700,12290.800," I started to realise"
12291.400,12293.600," I was having sensations in the chest area"
12294.200,12294.400," and that's"
12295.100,12297.800," one side of meditate emotional experience"
12298.500,12306.100," and I and I you know I I needed to embark on a part of therapy as well so I did some of that back then and it was really really helpful"
12306.700,12308.400," I got more emotionally liter"
12309.000,12310.600," that was that was progress"
12311.900,12314.200," and another phase of my practice I was"
12316.200,12317.200," I finally found"
12317.700,12318.300," a teacher"
12318.800,12321.500," in a meditative realm who understood"
12322.900,12328.600," you know an experience that I had out of the blue when I was a young man I didn't understand but I knew it was the answer to everything"
12329.600,12331.700," the non answer that was also a kind of answer"
12332.500,12332.700," and"
12333.400,12334.800," and he understood it"
12335.500,12336.800," and he helped me"
12338.200,12343.800," kind of work with it and and had a sort of follow on practice and that felt like a kind of progress"
12344.800,12345.100," um"
12345.900,12347.600," there was a point in my practice when"
12348.400,12349.000," all my"
12350.100,12351.400," ambition for practice"
12353.300,12353.800," by the way"
12355.000,12357.700," and I I was nothing more I wanted from it"
12358.600,12359.500," except to keep doing it"
12360.200,12361.300," that was a kind of progress"
12361.800,12363.100," I didn't want anything from any"
12364.400,12365.000," but I loved it"
12366.400,12367.800," I don't so I I think"
12368.600,12370.600," it's more like we're going on a journey"
12370.900,12371.700," and there will be"
12372.300,12373.200," new visitors"
12373.600,12374.500," mile markers"
12375.100,12375.900," terrains"
12376.800,12379.200," sometimes will be on a river sometimes we'll be on a"
12379.500,12381.800," rickety old bus sometimes will be on a"
12382.000,12386.900," limousine sometimes will be in a jeepney sometimes we'll be a horse-drawn cart and ox cart"
12387.400,12388.400," sometimes we you know"
12388.800,12390.000," saw legs and on foot"
12390.600,12393.000," it'll be all the above you know and it's a journey"
12393.900,12396.900," and it's really the decision that it's worth making this journey in life"
12397.600,12397.800," because"
12401.300,12403.100," well that's the decision I think"
12404.400,12408.800," and I mean it's very good the same thing about that the reason it is worse making"
12409.200,12410.100," that this particular"
12410.800,12413.700," having this agile to as we make the journey through life let's say"
12414.300,12418.300," that for my my perspective on it these days will be well"
12418.800,12424.700," because it gives us a chance a better shot at precisely whoever it was said being intimate with life"
12425.800,12427.600," because it's a much better shot of being"
12428.100,12429.000," more into butt"
12429.300,12431.400," intimate more consistently"
12432.900,12434.100," in other words living"
12434.700,12435.200," more"
12435.900,12437.200," I I see it as actual"
12438.200,12438.600," you know those"
12439.900,12444.700,"there's how much life you have in terms of duration in a certain sense but much more important that how much"
12445.000,12447.200," life you have in terms of something like aperture"
12448.300,12449.300," are you actually open"
12450.100,12450.200," to"
12451.000,12455.100," to life which means now it doesn't mean anything else really except now"
12455.800,12456.000," so"
12457.200,12458.500," that's a kind of progress"
12459.600,12462.100," but really I think probably in the end"
12463.000,12464.900," the notion of progress is problematic"
12467.300,12467.600," probably"
12468.400,12468.500," yeah"
12469.000,12474.100," yeah because it precisely because one of the things that can lead to is exactly what what you mentioned"
12474.900,12475.200," performance"
12477.700,12479.200," god am I am I doing it well"
12480.200,12480.300," you know"
12481.200,12482.800," performance anxiety actually"
12483.500,12484.200," it's a form of"
12485.400,12488.700," almost a kind of stage right you know I see my stuff I started"
12489.400,12490.700," going to regular"
12491.300,12494.900," sittings with others you know I would I would I would I would be quite nervous like"
12495.200,12496.600," well I managed to remain still"
12497.700,12498.800," will I make a noise"
12499.600,12501.100," you know accidentally or otherwise"
12502.700,12506.200," will I be in a glorious state of mind that others can sense"
12507.400,12510.400," that kind of Vanity but before you know"
12511.400,12512.300," and actually well"
12512.500,12514.800," I mean in this some parts of it we're"
12515.100,12518.000," not without reason actually because I used to go to this"
12518.500,12522.000," early on in my zen life I went to this monastery where"
12522.500,12524.500," they had what were called monitored"
12525.000,12526.900," and you're sitting in these long rows"
12527.500,12529.000," and at the end of each row"
12529.300,12532.300," you're all sitting facing the wall or the backs of the"
12532.900,12533.700," people in front of you"
12534.500,12538.400," who are also facing the war you know and then at the end of the road there's a monitor"
12539.500,12542.000," who's the one person in this end was one on each row"
12542.300,12544.600," who does not have their eyes lowered and looking at"
12546.000,12546.700," and they're looking"
12547.400,12548.500," but any trouble"
12548.900,12549.500," down the road"
12551.100,12552.400," anybody who moves"
12553.800,12555.600," you move a finger The Chronic"
12556.000,12556.600," the shout"
12556.800,12557.300," don't move"
12559.200,12560.100," it's kind of scary"
12561.000,12561.100," you know"
12562.300,12566.700," and I have this thing with I have allergy to cats and the Monastery had a cat"
12567.800,12569.400," so I will get you know"
12570.500,12571.400," you can't snivel"
12572.200,12573.000," you can't sniff"
12574.200,12574.800," shut up"
12575.300,12576.200," be quiet you know"
12577.100,12578.100," and I sit there with"
12580.800,12581.600," not to be too"
12582.400,12583.200," disgusting with"
12583.800,12584.100," it's not"
12584.800,12586.000," starting to dangle"
12586.800,12588.200," out of my nose and"
12589.000,12593.100," I would I would you know that feel it getting longer and longer"
12594.300,12595.500," and Sway"
12596.600,12600.500," this I wish it would break you know"
12600.900,12606.300," this swaying stand and then eventually I feel it on my on the back of my thumb"
12607.400,12609.500," if it's ya"
12610.100,12612.500," it made contact with the back of my thumb"
12613.000,12613.900," and that was good"
12614.900,12616.800," because it meant I was well aligned"
12617.200,12618.500," was they liked"
12621.600,12622.200," you know so"
12623.900,12624.300," anyway"
12624.900,12625.300," I think"
12626.400,12627.100," taking out"
12629.000,12630.500," progress from the equation"
12633.000,12635.200," I think the practice undone does us"
12637.700,12639.100," so being undone"
12640.400,12643.500," will also undone undo any sense of progress"
12644.800,12646.700," we don't need to make progress because we're here"
12647.700,12648.300," we're already here"
12649.100,12650.400," we've already reached the goal"
12652.100,12655.300," you could say well surely realizing that is a kind of progress"
12659.800,12661.400,"the only from the outside"
12662.500,12663.600," when you're in the goal"
12663.900,12668.700," you realize that there's no progress there was nothing to get to because he were always been here"
12672.200,12673.700," and progressive apparat"
12676.200,12676.600," yeah okay"
12677.000,12677.400," let's see"
12679.100,12680.000," okay- great thanks"
12682.300,12683.400," but thanks for the great question"
12693.600,12694.200," hello"
12695.700,12701.800," thank you so much for a truly wonderful day it's a different sort of question I have"
12702.600,12704.500," it's about your poetry"
12705.400,12708.100," as I really enjoyed the two poems"
12709.000,12716.300," and I wondered if you had any more and if you would thinking of published them or are there in your book or"
12716.700,12718.000," are they private to you"
12720.100,12722.100," actually well thank you very much for sharing that"
12723.200,12725.900," I do have I've actually you know I"
12726.700,12730.200," some of you know that if you've read that book of mine one blade of grass"
12730.700,12732.200," you know that the book was supposed to be"
12732.900,12735.900," a sort of declaration of why I stopped writing"
12736.700,12738.800," you know I wrote a book about why I stopped writing"
12739.700,12744.300," which is a little bit autological or paradoxical or something"
12744.800,12747.100," and then anyway since then and especially since"
12748.400,12752.500," the pandemic and and the various things I mentioned that sort of happened in my"
12753.100,12754.300," my corner of the world"
12755.000,12758.700," I've actually somehow suddenly been writing new poems and so"
12759.400,12763.000," they tend to be like those two that I shared today they're a bit more"
12766.300,12768.700," I don't know if they're really sort of about practice"
12770.200,12771.900," I'm not sure that they are but they're kind of"
12772.600,12779.000," they seem to be compatible or something or amenable to practice so congenial more congenial with practice somewhere"
12779.600,12782.200," so the short answer is yes I've got more and I'm actually"
12782.500,12783.000," I will be"
12784.600,12788.400," I will be published in that I mean I live long enough I plan to"
12789.400,12791.700," I have a plan to publish them yes"
12792.300,12793.200," yes so thank"
12793.600,12795.300," you for bringing us out very much thank you"
12798.000,12798.700," yeah hi"
12800.200,12801.000," shall I"
12801.500,12802.600," can we pass this back"
12803.800,12805.400," but now you okay thanks now yeah"
12810.400,12815.800," um so one of the things that I think my meditation practice is very brought me is"
12817.100,12819.700," the ability to be kind to myself and to feel"
12820.300,12821.200," more into what I need"
12821.800,12822.700," in any given moment"
12823.400,12824.300," and which I think"
12825.600,12826.600," is a thing that really grounds me"
12827.800,12832.800," and and something I've been struggling with recently which I think is maybe a little bit related to the last question"
12833.500,12833.600," is"
12834.700,12835.000," when I"
12835.700,12836.000," say it's"
12836.600,12836.900," I don't know"
12837.600,12839.400," a long day at work and I get home and"
12841.100,12842.000," I kind of feel like"
12844.200,12847.500," the last thing that I feel I needed that moment as meditation"
12848.200,12848.300," and"
12849.700,12851.900," the kind of thing I can do for myself is go to bed"
12852.500,12853.000," or in the morning"
12853.900,12858.200," the kind of thing I could do for myself and what I really need is to have a coffee instead of meditating"
12859.200,12861.000," and I know that's a real Conundrum because"
12862.100,12864.500," the thing that enables me to feel what I need"
12865.100,12865.700," is the meditation"
12866.800,12870.900," so I guess I was wondering if you have a new reflections on that paradox"
12871.600,12872.300," like"
12872.500,12873.500," how you move past that"
12874.000,12876.700," yes yes yes that's a great question as well that was"
12877.600,12880.200," did you all hear that by the way yeah yes a great question"
12881.700,12883.700," okay here's a here's a stab and answer"
12884.800,12887.000," um I think self-compassion"
12888.100,12891.300," like catch and what you're talking about is extremely important"
12892.100,12893.200," and it's often overlooked"
12893.900,12898.100," and it's one of the things that I think you know they say it's a Western problem"
12899.600,12902.800," more common in western now globalised Society"
12903.400,12906.900," there's a story famous story about a group of meditation teachers"
12907.800,12911.600," visiting with the Dalai Lama I think back in the 70s"
12912.700,12914.100," and one of them asked"
12915.300,12917.000," the Dalai Lama through the interpreter"
12917.600,12918.400," walking me to about"
12918.900,12919.800," self-loathing"
12921.500,12921.600," and"
12922.200,12925.200," the guy 99 armour and his interpreter got in a Hudl"
12926.000,12927.400," back and forth in Tibetan what"
12928.600,12933.500," kind of figure out what this wasn't the dialogue was a looked up and looked up back to chatting with"
12933.900,12934.800," the interprets"
12936.500,12938.200," and finally the top said"
12938.600,12939.800," his holiness is asking"
12940.400,12942.100," what is self Loathing"
12945.200,12946.500,"the story being"
12946.900,12947.500," that it"
12947.800,12953.200," pointing to the fact that it does seem to be more of a Western issue that we don't seem to"
12955.000,12957.700," we don't for whatever reasons we don't seem to be"
12958.500,12963.300," so good that at least not so good at self-kindness so self-compassion"
12964.000,12965.500," and I I think it gets over"
12966.600,12969.800," often in western practice I'm guilt was guilty of this myself"
12971.000,12972.600," it's easy to hop over that"
12974.000,12976.900," I want these great things that meditation could give"
12977.400,12980.000," calm their sub clarity and Awakening"
12981.200,12985.700," you know and especially when I hear Awakening is about Awakening from the illusion of self"
12986.600,12989.100," well that's a great one for the self loader"
12990.300,12992.500," what a way to get rid of him"
12994.400,12995.700," to find that he was never about"
12997.600,13002.100," but actually that's a really warm that's a real misunderstanding it says an error"
13002.600,13005.200," because it actually it's coming home to ourselves"
13006.300,13008.000," and that means kindness"
13009.200,13014.600," and then from that is possible it's true to go the deeper and deeper home and then"
13015.400,13021.300," somehow we find what we really are is our self that is actually a much bigger self"
13021.800,13023.700," but it's not really using quite the same way"
13025.000,13027.400," but I'm jumping ahead because the the"
13028.100,13033.000," practical matter is if I'm trying to have more self-compassion"
13034.000,13039.100," and I really need a break I don't need a sit I need a cup of tea or I need"
13039.900,13040.700," to go to bed"
13043.100,13045.600," something I heard just recently is that"
13046.500,13051.000," self-compassion training there are deliberate self compassion trainers by the way"
13052.100,13053.400," I have a yin side"
13053.900,13054.900," and a yang side"
13055.400,13058.700," and the inside is being really kind of myself"
13059.900,13062.300," and there's a young side as well which is"
13064.900,13065.600," holding myself"
13066.100,13066.700," to account"
13067.300,13073.900," in the interest of self-compassion so if there's a habit that I want to build that is good for myself compassion"
13074.500,13076.000," I will build it"
13077.200,13078.500," you know because it's good"
13078.800,13079.200," for me"
13080.100,13082.400," it's kind to me it helps me"
13083.200,13084.700," and that means that sometimes"
13085.400,13087.400," I put the short term"
13089.600,13093.600," hit aside and interests of the medium and longer term"
13094.300,13095.400," because I'm on a path"
13096.100,13096.900," is in other words"
13097.900,13099.000," yes there's a place for"
13099.800,13100.400," absolutely"
13101.200,13101.300," you know"
13102.200,13103.200," let me have a break"
13104.200,13105.100," and be kind to myself"
13106.600,13108.200," hopefully bath whatever you know"
13108.700,13110.100," there's totally a place for that"
13110.800,13111.600," but there's also"
13112.600,13115.700," a path of actually building in self-compassion"
13116.900,13117.800," and that pass"
13118.600,13119.100," is about"
13119.500,13120.000," sometimes"
13122.000,13122.700," longer term"
13124.200,13124.700," gain"
13125.100,13125.800," so to speak"
13126.100,13126.500," rather than"
13127.000,13127.600," immediate"
13128.400,13129.800," so you've feel your way with that"
13130.300,13133.700," I mean personally I don't find any incompatibility between"
13134.400,13137.600," a sit in a cup of coffee actually I quite often"
13138.500,13141.700," I quite often make a cup of coffee and take it with me"
13142.200,13143.700," so I'm gonna sit"
13144.200,13146.100," and the first few minutes I'm sipping the coffee"
13147.500,13148.000," that's fine"
13149.100,13149.300," you know"
13150.100,13150.300," yeah"
13151.400,13153.100," okay any other thanks to that"
13153.600,13154.900," core question actually yeah"
13157.400,13159.700," thank you Henry you mentioned"
13160.300,13162.700," therapy before and also"
13164.600,13168.000," I suppose a relates to your second poem as well in terms of"
13169.300,13172.300," the winter Lake which I found really beautiful and moving by the way"
13173.000,13173.100," so"
13173.800,13175.400," I work as a therapist and"
13177.600,13180.500," see a lot of people who have obviously experienced a lot of"
13181.300,13182.400," like very bad suffering"
13183.200,13183.300," and"
13185.800,13190.300," I'm really curious like what are the sort of factors that leads some people to"
13192.700,13194.800," what kind of opens them up and it's"
13195.500,13195.800," sort of"
13196.700,13198.300," revealing a kind of fertile"
13199.100,13202.900," ground for practice and for other people they kind of really shut down and"
13203.600,13205.100," it sort of dust the opposite"
13206.200,13206.400," and"
13208.200,13210.600," I suppose I'm curious on on your view"
13211.300,13211.900," in terms of"
13212.800,13214.800," I mean there's so many therapeutic models and"
13215.400,13223.700," theories and and so on so forth and if you had to think about therapy and maybe also how mindfulness or meditation comes into it"
13224.500,13225.000," on"
13226.400,13226.500," yeah"
13227.800,13228.000," I mean"
13228.500,13232.600," partially I suppose it would be nervous system co-regulation with another person"
13233.500,13239.400," maybe becoming more emotional literate like like you said but I'm curious about anything you have to say on that topic really"
13240.700,13241.300," thank you"
13242.400,13246.300," yeah that's a great topic it's a great question it has"
13246.800,13248.900," one thing that I feel is that"
13251.000,13253.100," you know there's there's millions of parts"
13253.800,13257.600," you know the there are necessarily wholesale answers there's"
13258.200,13260.400," everybody's got their own mysterious way"
13260.900,13261.600," there's something about"
13263.100,13264.300," this is not a direct answer"
13264.800,13268.200," but there's something about adding in The Dimension of awareness"
13269.000,13269.800," into the picture"
13270.200,13271.200," whether it's yours"
13272.000,13272.400," or"
13272.900,13273.600," the clients"
13275.200,13278.400," it's changes it a bit there's some"
13278.800,13279.400," I heard a"
13279.900,13283.100," whole I got one of those online courses which is a whole load of"
13283.700,13284.100," famous"
13284.800,13286.300," therapists talking about trauma"
13287.100,13291.300," and just it was I learned a lot from it but somewhere in there there was just a comment that"
13292.400,13295.500," there was some research that seemed to show that the"
13296.900,13299.000," therapies that work best"
13299.900,13304.200," well with therapists of whatever kind who had more awareness"
13307.600,13313.600," it reminds me of there's actually on the waking up at there's a great series of talks bus guide us CBT"
13314.600,13316.300," and or mindful CBT"
13316.900,13323.100," and he talks about the old model of CBT you know many of you might know is about there's thoughts"
13323.600,13326.200," there's feelings and there's behaviors the three things"
13326.800,13328.100," and they all influence each other"
13328.900,13331.500," and the CBT Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"
13331.900,13333.100," aims to intervene"
13333.600,13337.400," at one of the three points and it sort of doesn't matter which whichever works thinking"
13338.000,13338.400," feeling"
13338.800,13339.200," acting"
13340.200,13341.800," but mindful CBT"
13342.600,13344.400," is not a triangle it's a"
13344.900,13345.700," tetrahedron"
13346.400,13346.600," you know"
13347.000,13348.500," you know what I mean a three-sided pyramid"
13349.000,13350.100," in order as it brings in"
13350.800,13351.300," awareness"
13351.800,13352.700," mindful awareness"
13353.200,13354.400," so suddenly what was a"
13355.600,13356.400," two-dimensional"
13357.200,13359.000," image becomes three dimensions"
13359.400,13361.200," and I think that's quite a good analogy"
13361.900,13363.000," but what meditation can"
13363.500,13364.100," can do"
13366.300,13367.000," but I think it's all"
13367.600,13369.700," it's all about mysterious you know sometimes"
13370.300,13371.400," is the last thing"
13372.200,13374.400," a person in post traumatic stress needs"
13375.100,13379.300," you know it might just need a watch a nice TV show or who knows I mean"
13379.900,13386.900," along with all the other whatever other kinds of help they're getting they may need to dance they may need to I mean I I only know what"
13387.200,13392.000," we all might learn from best or Vanda or something like that is great book the body keeps the school"
13393.000,13394.600," if you're curious about that it's a"
13394.900,13395.900," Panorama of"
13398.200,13399.700," traumatic work"
13402.000,13406.900," I'm out you know I've of course have a reflected as somewhat on it in my own journey because I had a"
13407.600,13409.000," somewhat traumatic childhood"
13409.600,13414.800," with a chronic screen serious skin condition that was there from the age of six months and"
13415.400,13419.700," it must have been a heavy trauma right then that triggered it and that I then lived with"
13420.400,13422.700," and I could see how you know there's a lot of things"
13423.600,13425.700," yeah tight and yucky in me"
13426.100,13427.200," that took quite a lot of"
13428.700,13433.600," gradual on winding and releasing through different kinds of therapy and through a lot of sitting and"
13437.700,13439.800," I think we're in a fantastic place"
13440.700,13441.700," that we're learning"
13442.500,13444.800," more of our all this stuff and that"
13445.200,13449.400," I deeply believe in meditation as a part of healing I think it's basically what it is"
13450.500,13453.500," and I think we'll get better and better at it"
13454.000,13455.900," I mean there's a there's a marvelous"
13457.300,13459.600," German Swiss actually"
13460.200,13460.800," student that"
13461.200,13462.300," who studied with me"
13463.100,13467.000," then guy have been in it for 40 years I think he's just had this analogy said"
13467.600,13468.800," oh yes you know it's like"
13469.700,13470.200," mountaineering"
13471.100,13471.700," it used to be"
13472.900,13474.400," leather and fur and"
13475.000,13476.800," Incredibly heavy ropes and"
13477.900,13486.100," I am cramp owns or whatever announcement out of detainee him and Incredibly light fabrics and you know it used to be that nobody had been up Everest then"
13487.000,13488.500," one person every decade"
13489.000,13492.800," and now thousands you know the point where all that's a good thing but"
13493.300,13501.100," but the point being that it got it's got easier and maybe this whole business of the meditative path the car track with its two Ruts"
13501.600,13503.600," is just going to get kind of easier"
13504.500,13506.200," and maybe it already is like"
13506.800,13509.100," where we were I mean when I started"
13509.700,13510.600," it wasn't that"
13511.100,13514.400," easy to get guidance on this thing called awaken"
13515.000,13517.700," there weren't that many people who are clear what it was"
13518.100,13519.300," or had any idea"
13520.000,13521.900," that there could be any methodology for"
13522.200,13526.000," approaching it let alone integrating it and let alone living it"
