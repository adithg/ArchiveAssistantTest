1.800,2.600,"good to"
2.800,4.700," to be here on this lovely morning"
8.000,8.700," can you feel"
10.200,13.700," that that you spend the last two days more engaged"
14.300,15.300," much more engaged"
16.400,16.600," than"
17.100,17.500," normally"
18.400,19.100," with practice"
20.000,21.500," and that you've been doing it with others"
22.600,22.800," yeah"
25.300,25.600," so just"
26.000,27.000," you know let that in"
27.300,27.700," and a little bit"
45.200,48.400," there's a process of kind of refining the atmosphere"
49.300,51.100," that goes on in a in a retreat"
51.500,51.800," where"
54.000,55.700," each of us individually"
56.400,57.300," is getting more"
58.600,59.900," kind of a aligned"
60.300,60.500," with"
62.800,66.200," reality really we're getting more aligned with"
67.400,68.000," how things are"
68.900,69.800," and at the same time"
71.300,73.400," all of us are sort of collectively-"
74.000,77.700," dining in in some hidden way kind of to one another"
79.100,81.900," and we maybe more or less aware of that I used to feel"
82.700,85.500," doing the Deep zen retreats after a while"
86.200,89.900," that because then during the xen riches you're you know as I said you have mostly"
90.600,92.000," basically looking at a wall"
92.400,94.900," or at the back of somebody between you and the wall"
95.400,97.400," you know depending on a number of rows or maybe the"
97.500,98.400," the back of somebody"
99.400,102.000," who's looking at the back of somebody else who's looking at the war"
102.200,104.200," you know but three rows per side"
105.000,105.100," and"
106.500,109.800," so you're not looking at one another and it's actually a one of the"
111.100,114.900," guidelines in those retreats is not to look at one another"
116.000,117.600," you know through the days you you"
118.500,122.100," you're trying to drop the cronico social self"
123.200,124.700," the one that is habituated to"
125.200,127.800," glance is smiles in a little nods and"
128.400,130.400," none of that you just let that all go"
131.400,138.100," and at first people think oh God there's so rude you know but gradually you get used to it and you realise"
139.000,143.200," that something else is being allowed to come forth"
143.400,144.400," which is"
145.200,148.400," a way that we can sense one another"
150.000,153.700," not see and hear one another but since one another"
154.700,157.000," and gradually through the days that gets"
157.500,158.100," stronger"
158.900,161.500," so you come back to your seat in the end of"
162.500,164.600," you know you sit there facing"
166.500,166.900," away"
167.300,169.700," from other people's faces you're just"
170.700,172.300," eyes open gaze lowered"
173.600,173.800," and"
175.300,177.700," you know you might think of it as the seat of torment"
179.000,182.500," because you've been through lots of body pain and lots of emotional"
182.900,188.500," stuff as surface and you find yourself very frustrated that the practice isn't going the way it's supposed to go"
189.000,191.700," you know actually it is it's going exactly the way it's supposed to go"
192.900,193.900," but it doesn't feel like it"
194.300,196.100," or you always the seat of bliss"
197.000,198.100," you've been finding this"
198.500,202.600," incredible samadhi this calm this piece this attentiveness that"
203.200,205.300," nothing seems to switch off it's just"
205.700,206.200," riding"
207.200,208.300," gorgeous"
210.200,215.000," tropical left break of a bliss you know it can happen"
216.100,218.600," but either way when you come back actually"
219.400,220.200," you suddenly"
221.700,222.300," you suddenly"
222.600,224.900," start to sense more vividly"
225.300,227.800," but like there's like there's an underground route system"
228.600,231.200," and we just hadn't been aware of this connecting us with others"
231.800,232.400," it's a kind of"
233.300,235.900," subtle communion"
236.100,239.100," you know community showing itself in a way that"
239.700,241.900," just isn't the normal ways but is"
242.700,243.600," very real"
244.800,245.000," and"
246.500,248.400," I know this is a different format"
249.100,250.200," we have here where"
252.200,252.700," it's not"
253.600,255.700," it's not just silence and stillness"
257.200,259.000," and and God help you if you don't"
259.500,260.600," be silent and still"
262.500,265.800," in the strict and monasteries now they don't like it yeah"
268.200,270.300," it but this is of course it's different"
270.800,273.200," but actually it's also the same"
274.000,274.200," that's"
274.500,275.700," also the same"
276.500,277.500," unseen"
278.000,280.900," Gathering together that's being going on these days"
281.600,282.500," and it doesn't matter"
283.100,284.500," if you if you really feel"
285.200,287.100," you're not feeling that at all"
287.900,288.600," and Henry"
289.600,291.100," is once again talking crazy stuff"
291.600,295.100," or if you are feeling it it doesn't really matter"
296.100,298.900," because so much of the journey of practice"
300.000,301.800," is that is really unconscious"
303.100,305.300," so much ripening is going on"
305.900,307.100," unknown to us"
308.300,308.400," now"
309.100,309.600," we need"
310.800,311.700," I mean these days"
312.300,313.100," you know in the world of"
314.000,316.700," the mindfulness movement the massive mindfulness movement"
317.300,321.000," of course understandably every everybody sort of wants the conscience"
321.400,322.400," benefits of practice"
323.000,326.700," and very understandably and and they can be there too"
327.600,331.900," and they're kind of maybe in a way need to be to keep us motivated and incentivized"
332.900,333.300," but"
333.900,336.300," whether you know so if we're not getting"
337.000,340.500," consciously detectable benefits we probably will stop"
341.300,341.500," you know"
343.400,343.600," but"
344.400,344.700," truly"
345.200,346.700," the greater benefits"
347.400,347.700," grow"
348.800,349.300," underneath"
349.900,353.400," the surface of our conscious awareness they really do and"
354.600,356.300," that's a hard thing I know to"
356.700,357.400," take on Trust"
358.100,360.500," and I certainly didn't for many a year"
361.100,362.800," I I really"
363.300,365.100," was very attuned to how"
366.100,369.500," how much I was enjoying practice when I had a sit"
370.000,372.000," and how much I could send it in my life"
372.600,373.100," or not"
373.900,375.700," you know but I kept doing it anyway"
376.500,380.500," because I was desperate enough basically to have to just keep doing it"
381.300,383.400," and I got so off the rails if I didn't do it"
384.200,385.500," I got I know it was partly"
386.700,393.100," me being nervous and anxious and feeling oh my god I didn't do it today oh my god what's gonna happen to me you know"
393.800,395.900," and there was also partly that's actually"
397.000,398.700," we do get a little more"
400.200,400.900," emotionally"
402.200,404.300," blowing in the winds you know if we're not"
405.300,410.300," deadly practicing some of us anyway many of us probably will find that if we used to a practice"
412.000,412.100," but"
413.100,413.800," all along"
415.000,416.900," there's other processes that are happening"
417.900,419.100," that we're not aware of"
420.000,422.000," and that is a I suppose that's a face"
422.600,423.700," thing or a trust thing"
424.500,425.400," to trust that"
426.200,427.800," there is something going on"
429.000,431.300," above and beyond what we can sense"
431.900,432.100," and"
433.700,435.300," in unexpected ways"
435.700,437.100," not in expected ways"
439.600,440.000," sometimes"
440.600,440.800," those"
441.500,443.000," what those processes have been"
443.500,444.300," about will just"
445.000,445.200," break"
445.700,446.300," through the surface"
446.900,447.600," and show themselves"
449.300,449.300," and"
453.100,453.500," so"
454.500,456.000," just to kind of"
456.800,458.000," underscore"
459.000,462.400," that in a gathering like this over these days"
463.400,464.600," there's all that we know"
465.500,466.200," that's going on"
466.900,469.200," and there's also all that we don't know"
469.600,470.500," there's also going on"
474.800,475.600," okay that's"
476.100,477.000," do a bit of sitting"
493.700,494.500," no just water"
498.100,500.500," okay so we'll I'll do some guidance and"
502.200,505.000," a little hopefully get some quiet as well and"
506.700,508.600," sort of thinking 25 minutes"
509.300,510.200," we'll see how we go"
512.400,514.500," I'll try to have a soft ending so"
515.700,520.200," a blurry ending so those who want to keep sitting just just keep sitting for a while"
522.200,523.400," those who want to move and"
524.700,524.800," and"
526.500,527.900," perhaps even get up that's okay"
529.400,530.300," and"
534.100,535.700," I feel that sort of lead you through"
537.200,541.100," just some of that I often do and I found very useful over the years"
585.700,586.400," so let's"
586.600,589.200," start with getting the spine"
589.600,590.200," comfortable"
590.800,592.100," if it's supported"
592.900,595.700," really let it be supported feel"
597.300,601.200," the support behind you holding you up holding up your spine really"
602.300,605.600," trusted enjoy it release into it letting"
608.100,612.900," Letting your upper body relaxed and if you're balanced with a free spine"
614.400,618.000," yeah do a little side to side a little front and back"
619.200,624.100," the area away and you can actually you can also do little circles they can be really nice"
625.000,628.400," tiny little circles that get smaller and smaller like a spiral"
629.800,630.900," and as you're doing that"
631.300,634.300," let yourself kind of align your spine as well"
635.200,636.500," it might need a little adjustment"
637.900,639.900," often I find you know with with"
641.000,641.800," with with with with with"
643.800,644.900," the male body"
645.600,647.000," often we need a little more"
648.300,654.400," lumbar arch the the lower back coming forward the belly button moving forwards just a bit"
655.000,655.600," and sometimes"
656.800,659.600," female spine often seems to be a bit more"
661.100,662.600," well aligned anyway but"
664.100,666.700," I might be quite wrong about that so just check that you're"
667.500,670.800," you've got a little bit of lumbar art in the lower spine if you're"
673.100,674.400," if you're back is free"
676.300,677.400," and then you can whatever"
678.200,680.500," is happening with your spine you can let the shoulders"
682.500,683.700," kind of be a bit heavy"
685.300,687.000," not to the front not to the back"
688.000,688.300," down"
690.700,691.500," like a pair of"
692.100,693.600," heavy epilepsy"
696.300,697.300," sinking shoulders"
700.600,704.900," and that syncing is also happening to arms and hands"
706.300,709.800," like really imagine thick damp"
710.200,710.500," heavy"
711.200,711.800," ropes"
712.900,714.200," a little sailing ship"
715.300,716.500," that your arms be like that"
720.100,724.700," and you might even sense a bit of a drawer down from your neck and your throat"
725.800,727.300," cause of these heavy ropes"
728.900,732.800," that's good that's fine and let your chin and jewel go"
742.300,744.100," maybe let the"
745.900,747.800," the back of the head rise"
748.500,752.700," a tiny bit as if it was rising up a wall behind you"
753.300,754.200," back of the head"
755.000,757.700," so the chin actually moves a little bit into the throat"
759.600,760.500," just a wee bit"
761.900,763.100," and the back of the head"
764.200,766.600," and back of the neck it's as if they're slidin'"
767.800,768.600," a tiny bit"
769.400,770.800," upper wall behind you"
772.700,777.000," okay but then we got to relax everything so hold that position and relax relax relax"
778.200,778.900," that go like"
781.100,782.000," feel the seat"
783.600,784.200," a seat"
784.800,785.000," should"
785.500,789.200," press a bit more as we relax there should be a bit more pressure"
790.900,792.700," basically as if we are getting heavier"
802.200,806.700," however there are arranged let your lower limbs your legs be almost like a nest"
809.700,811.400," or routes that are kind of"
812.600,814.000," melded with the Earth"
817.400,818.900," and the upper body is like a"
819.100,819.900," stork"
820.600,821.200," of a flower"
827.200,827.700," Rising"
829.200,829.600," freely"
837.000,837.400," and we're going to"
839.000,842.700," we're going to use a helpful categorisation which is"
843.500,845.400," that we have outward experience"
846.100,846.500," physical"
847.800,849.900," world facing experience"
851.300,851.900," sounds"
852.500,853.000," sites"
854.000,855.100," hearing and seeing"
856.200,857.300," and sensing the body"
862.900,864.000," so just open up"
865.100,866.900," to external experience"
868.100,870.700," to the senses the sensations in the body"
873.600,874.200," where it's"
874.500,875.400," making contact"
876.000,878.100," with different things including the air"
879.800,880.800," including clothing"
888.300,891.700," and between body parts for example hands on"
892.200,892.800," thigh"
900.900,902.700," in any bare skin"
904.500,905.500," sensing the air"
912.900,915.900," and where the body is contacting what supports us"
918.700,919.600," seat and floor"
939.600,940.200," then we can"
941.800,943.400," just listen for a while"
985.300,986.100," listening"
1018.000,1018.400," and"
1019.900,1022.900," that sight to be like"
1023.100,1023.600," a kind of"
1024.100,1024.800," screen"
1026.000,1028.300," whether your eyes are closed or open"
1035.100,1036.100," and gaze"
1037.300,1038.300," kind of Softly"
1041.400,1043.400," into the screen of sight"
1075.900,1077.500," there is there a way that"
1078.500,1079.300," you can rest"
1081.500,1084.000," somehow in all of these outward"
1085.800,1089.100," sensei channels all three of them body"
1089.800,1091.300," seeing and hearing"
1092.600,1096.300," and it might at any time be more one than another"
1097.500,1098.700," and that's just fine"
1100.800,1102.300," see if you can just rest"
1104.800,1107.900," in the awareness of outward"
1109.200,1109.800," experience"
1113.500,1115.400," including bodies sensations"
1142.100,1143.500," and if you like you can"
1144.400,1145.900," pick up a little label"
1146.900,1147.200," out"
1149.700,1153.100," every few moments every few seconds even"
1154.500,1154.900," gently"
1157.000,1158.400," in a matter of fact voice"
1158.800,1159.600," in your mind"
1160.200,1161.100," say to yourself"
1170.800,1174.500," a little reminder that we're foregrounding"
1175.600,1177.500," our outward experience"
1179.400,1179.800," just now"
1222.600,1224.000," if you find your"
1225.000,1227.100," your mind becomes aware of the breath"
1228.600,1228.800," that's"
1229.600,1232.500," part of outward experience as well"
1234.100,1235.100," body sens"
1300.400,1304.900," so now and then we might realise that our attention have wondered"
1306.100,1307.200," from out"
1307.800,1309.000," with experience and"
1310.200,1310.500," if we"
1311.700,1312.900," investigated a little"
1314.200,1317.100," we'll find the we had gone into thought"
1318.600,1319.100," typically"
1320.100,1321.000," that we're just going to"
1323.900,1324.300," track"
1325.100,1327.000," Air for when that happens"
1327.300,1329.300," and when we become aware of it"
1330.600,1333.700," just check whether he had gone to"
1335.000,1335.500," planning"
1339.200,1340.600," or memories"
1343.300,1343.600," or"
1345.000,1345.600," imagining"
1349.800,1351.500," and make a mental note"
1353.300,1354.300," of which it was"
1357.400,1358.500," and come back to"
1360.200,1361.200," our word experience"
1362.700,1364.600," and again pick up the little label"
1366.100,1366.900," see if it helps"
1369.700,1370.100," out"
1392.900,1394.900," really we're resting"
1395.200,1396.400," in awareness"
1399.800,1401.400," sounds sites"
1401.700,1402.300," body"
1403.900,1405.000," all the one"
1406.900,1407.500," or two"
1407.800,1409.300," whatever it may be in any time"
1462.700,1463.600,"now knowing is"
1464.000,1468.200," totally natural the thoughts with bubble up from time to time"
1474.400,1475.900," not a problem at all"
1477.800,1480.100," part of our practice"
1481.500,1483.700," if you do find there's a lot of thinking"
1486.500,1488.700," check in with the chest area"
1490.400,1493.400," see how that is doing is there any"
1494.900,1497.100," sensation of energy of some kind"
1498.400,1503.100," or perhaps tightness or tension or heat or density or weight"
1504.600,1507.500," in the chest area and if there is Let It Be There"
1508.300,1509.200," welcome it"
1514.800,1515.200," give it"
1515.500,1516.500," your loving awareness"
1521.200,1522.100," that it be"
1524.200,1524.900," fully enough"
1553.800,1554.300," that actually"
1555.400,1558.100," along with the outward experience"
1560.500,1561.000," we've been"
1563.100,1563.700," exploring"
1564.500,1565.500," we also have"
1566.800,1567.900," kind of inward"
1569.600,1571.300," landscape of experience"
1572.600,1574.000," which is made up of thoughts"
1575.000,1575.800," and feelings"
1578.900,1578.900," so"
1581.400,1583.000," kind of the next step"
1584.400,1585.800," is to be open to both"
1590.900,1592.000," to know whether"
1594.500,1598.600," once Uppermost in our awareness is out with experience"
1600.200,1600.600," or"
1602.200,1602.700," inward"
1603.000,1603.400," experience"
1605.700,1608.500," and being equally open to both"
1616.100,1618.200," and we can see what is like"
1620.000,1624.600," to keep resting with the outward experience using the label out"
1626.400,1627.200," out"
1630.000,1631.900," and then if we find"
1634.000,1634.600," we've"
1636.300,1637.200," gone elsewhere"
1640.200,1640.600," check"
1641.500,1645.600," to see that it's probably been into inward experience"
1647.100,1647.400," thought"
1648.100,1648.600," feeling"
1650.500,1651.500," and label in"
1654.400,1654.700," in"
1657.000,1659.600," so we know that's what's been"
1666.300,1666.300," happening"
1668.900,1670.000," and then come back"
1681.500,1682.700," out with experience"
1684.800,1686.000," inward experienced"
1690.500,1691.900," starting to get to know"
1693.100,1693.800," which it is"
1694.900,1695.600," at any time"
1801.300,1802.900," that are nice just see"
1804.000,1806.200," is it possible that there is"
1808.100,1808.800," some kind of"
1810.900,1812.500," Central awareness"
1815.300,1816.200," that we can find"
1818.700,1819.600," right in the middle"
1820.500,1822.000," of all our experience"
1823.400,1824.700," equally the outer"
1825.200,1826.900," and the inner experience"
1828.000,1829.100," one awareness"
1830.900,1832.200," there is open to all of"
1836.000,1837.400," it and includes all of it"
1841.800,1846.400," don't know need to try to find that but just be aware that it may"
1847.300,1847.700," sometimes"
1848.800,1849.500," show itself"
1857.200,1860.600," it seems to come on mostly by resting"
1865.100,1866.400," resting in the middle"
1867.700,1868.900," of your experience"
1871.100,1872.300," or having to do anything"
1879.600,1881.800," being with sound es"
1883.800,1884.300," body"
1887.000,1887.500," thought"
1890.000,1891.500," emotions Sensation"
1892.900,1894.100," being with any of it"
1901.100,1901.600," may"
1901.900,1902.500," open up"
1905.400,1906.900," a kind of all inclusive"
1908.800,1909.500," awareness"
1912.900,1914.500," there seems to suffuse"
1915.900,1916.800," all our exper"
1929.900,1931.500," and very restful"
1983.800,1988.200," look good for just a bit longer so if you want to adjust your body"
1989.200,1991.100," another five minutes or so"
1992.300,1993.800," please do so you know"
1994.500,1995.700," slowly and mindfully"
2001.700,2004.100," and at any time of course if you need to adjust"
2004.500,2005.200," do"
2063.500,2063.500," so"
2429.400,2431.800,"you know it it is called practice for a reason"
2433.100,2435.000," that the more we practice it"
2435.500,2438.500," more facility we can get with some of the tools"
2439.600,2439.900," and"
2442.000,2445.700," if there was one thing that I'd really want to encourage a kind of"
2446.500,2448.700," maybe not absolutely beginner but sort of novice"
2450.300,2453.300," to intermediate- meditator which is more or less what I think I am"
2454.000,2458.700," to do it would be there would be that out and ending just knowing"
2459.400,2460.900," when you're sitting am I"
2461.900,2464.200," am I opened to out with experience"
2465.700,2467.900," am I caught in inward experienced"
2470.200,2472.900," namely thinking and feeling what either or both"
2474.600,2478.100," or am I open to inward experience in other words"
2478.600,2481.400," thoughts can arise and I stay aware"
2481.800,2482.900," that they're Arris"
2483.600,2484.900," I can actually hear"
2485.800,2486.300," the voice"
2486.700,2488.100," in the mind it's a magical"
2489.400,2491.300," property actually a thought"
2492.200,2493.500," that we can get so"
2495.000,2497.400," identified with it invested in it"
2497.900,2499.100," caught up in it"
2499.700,2502.200," it's really the only thing that actually"
2502.900,2506.200," really when you track it down to the only thing that stops us being aware"
2506.700,2507.900," of our immediate experience"
2508.900,2510.200," is the Habit"
2510.900,2511.900," the kind of"
2513.300,2514.400," socially conditioned and"
2515.100,2516.900," personally conditioned habit"
2517.500,2517.700," of"
2520.300,2523.000," letting thought take over"
2524.100,2526.900," you know it's so what's actually happening when"
2527.500,2528.100," we're thinking"
2529.400,2531.800," almost always is Torquay in the mind"
2533.900,2534.800," and or"
2535.200,2536.300," images in the mind"
2538.100,2539.500," and I say almost always because"
2540.000,2541.600," if somebody plays a lot of music"
2543.000,2545.200," or maybe listen to a lot of music they're probably here"
2545.700,2546.700," tunes at times"
2547.000,2547.900," so it's not words"
2548.300,2549.500," you know tunes but"
2549.700,2551.100," but you're hearing stuff"
2551.900,2552.900," and seeing stuff"
2553.600,2555.600," that's basically what thinking is"
2556.200,2557.700," and of course Some Might"
2559.100,2561.600," people have program a lot might see a lot of"
2561.900,2563.100," coding or something you know"
2563.900,2564.300," people who"
2566.300,2567.700," mathematicians might"
2568.200,2568.900," might see"
2570.200,2574.700," or might even I don't know whether you could hear equations and functions and it's but maybe they could you know"
2575.400,2576.600," but you could see it in a"
2577.000,2578.200," so what we do my"
2578.900,2579.400," my uh"
2580.600,2584.800," to some of them interest what we actually see or hear is not necessarily talk"
2586.000,2588.300," but by and large we get caught by movies"
2589.100,2590.200," in the mind you know with"
2591.800,2592.700," with soundtracks"
2593.100,2593.300," you know"
2594.300,2594.400," and"
2595.100,2596.800," it is kind of amazing that"
2597.600,2599.700," we get so core up in it"
2600.200,2602.000," and don't even notice it's going on"
2602.800,2605.500," it's a it's a it's a magical property of it really"
2606.200,2608.000," it gets very sucked in"
2609.100,2612.300," and and becoming more mindful is just"
2613.500,2615.000," not so much actually"
2615.800,2616.800," not having that"
2617.300,2617.900," happen"
2618.600,2619.900," not having thoughts and"
2620.400,2621.900," emotions about a rise"
2622.400,2624.200," it's becoming more aware"
2624.600,2625.100," of when they're"
2625.500,2627.300," arising and there's a Tibetan"
2627.700,2629.900," Buddhist teaching that there's two kinds of thoughts"
2630.600,2632.400," head thoughts and tail thoughts"
2633.100,2635.500," the little bit of a weird image but the idea is that"
2637.300,2638.100," thoughts are like"
2638.600,2640.400," fish that put their head up"
2640.800,2642.200," out of the water and"
2643.600,2647.300," if the fish is allowed to leap free of the water and"
2647.800,2649.800," it's tail shows up we follow it"
2650.500,2653.400," we're gone we're sort of quote by the tail of the fish"
2654.300,2657.500," but if we're mindful enough we can see the head pop up"
2658.700,2659.000," and then"
2659.600,2661.000," it doesn't leap out"
2661.300,2662.900," and catch us by the tail"
2663.400,2664.700," as a slightly weird image but"
2665.400,2666.200," it's actually a few"
2666.900,2670.300," if you start experiencing what it's like to have head thoughts"
2671.000,2672.900," but only the head of the fish"
2673.400,2674.500," comes out and you see it"
2677.400,2678.400," and it goes back down again"
2679.000,2681.700," then you start to get how the images actually quite good"
2682.600,2683.600," for what is like when"
2684.400,2685.500," we start getting"
2686.100,2686.800," the capacity"
2687.300,2688.200," to notice"
2690.400,2690.600," yeah"
2690.900,2693.000," I heard that voice"
2693.800,2696.800," there was actually a little speech packet"
2697.600,2698.500," that I heard"
2699.500,2700.300," in my mind"
2702.000,2702.700," that's good"
2703.300,2704.900," that's becoming more aware"
2706.100,2711.300," of the process of thinking of what is actually made up of you might not believe me"
2711.700,2713.000," hearing this as you might not"
2714.000,2716.100," imagine think this doesn't apply to you"
2716.600,2716.800," you know"
2717.500,2718.700," my thinking is not like that"
2719.300,2720.200," but I bet"
2720.600,2725.600," if you really start looking and listening you'll see that it actually is like"
2726.300,2727.900," that that there are little"
2728.400,2730.000," radio bulletins"
2731.100,2731.800," beach packets"
2732.300,2732.600," speech"
2735.500,2736.700," and if you type a lot"
2737.600,2742.300," you know you might see well that's probably but mostly you're going to hear"
2743.500,2744.900," gonna hear this little"
2746.500,2748.500," Force comment commentator you know"
2749.800,2751.200," talking through the day you know"
2751.800,2753.100," so becoming more aware of that"
2753.900,2755.800," man it's it's a big thing actually"
2756.400,2757.500," head thoughts"
2758.600,2760.300," as opposed to tale for us"
2762.600,2766.900," so when the simplified version of all that is out"
2767.600,2768.100," and"
2769.200,2771.400," in two labels it's outward experience"
2772.300,2773.600," is inward experienced"
2774.800,2776.100," so that would be the"
2777.000,2777.900," the real kind of"
2780.200,2781.600," sort of all purpose"
2782.700,2783.000," sort of"
2783.700,2784.800," novice to intermediate"
2785.600,2786.100," practice"
2786.500,2788.100," to really get more clear"
2788.800,2789.500," when sitting"
2789.900,2791.000," is it outward experience"
2792.200,2794.200," hearing seeing sensing body"
2795.100,2796.300," is it inward experienced"
2796.900,2797.800," basically thoughts"
2798.800,2799.400," and emotions"
2802.100,2803.700," and it's such a it's such a"
2804.800,2809.600," clean clear way you know to approach meditation basically that's from shins & Young"
2810.300,2811.600," is so simplified"
2812.500,2815.200," more complex forms of that kind of mindfulness"
2816.200,2817.800," and what's also cool about it"
2818.300,2820.800," is I find and I hope you would too"
2821.400,2823.600," that when you start being more aware"
2823.900,2824.800," it is outward"
2825.400,2826.000," it's inward"
2826.600,2828.900," you don't have to you don't have to divide it between"
2830.000,2831.700," hearing and seeing it's just outward"
2832.500,2836.100," you start to find that there is indeed one kind of awareness"
2837.300,2838.300," that includes all three"
2838.900,2839.400," body"
2840.200,2841.200," physical Sensation"
2842.000,2844.700," hearing and seeing it's sort of one awareness"
2845.300,2846.500," that has Three Faces"
2847.100,2849.400," and you can start to rest in that one away"
2850.300,2851.900," and the same thing then happens with"
2852.500,2854.200," inward experience that there's actually"
2855.300,2858.200," really in the end of just one awareness and it can do"
2858.600,2862.200," so it can do feeling it can do site it can do sound it can do body"
2862.500,2863.300," you can do all of it"
2863.700,2866.600," and you start to rest in a single awareness"
2867.300,2870.200," where these different kinds of experience arise"
2870.700,2871.700," but the awareness"
2872.400,2873.100," is one"
2874.400,2877.400," and that's a really nice place to hang out"
2878.100,2880.400," because that all inclusive awareness"
2881.000,2881.100," is"
2881.700,2882.000," both"
2882.800,2884.300," attentive and aware"
2884.900,2888.400," and kind of alert it knows what's going on"
2889.900,2890.300," and is"
2890.700,2892.000," deeply rest"
2892.900,2894.100," it's just a piece"
2895.200,2896.100," anything goes"
2897.600,2899.200," it's understandable"
2899.700,2900.300," but highly"
2901.400,2902.700," sensitive responsive"
2904.500,2905.500," good at detect"
2907.000,2908.400," that that is just sort of"
2909.200,2910.500," It's a Wonderful Thing"
2911.300,2913.500," to find that you've got"
2914.100,2916.700," already your pre-installed with"
2917.200,2918.800," this in a capacity"
2919.500,2921.400," and then to take that through your life"
2923.400,2925.700," it's amazing because actually there's a"
2926.700,2930.600," quality because that awareness is a restful and b"
2931.200,2931.900," attentive"
2933.500,2936.200," therefore it's very easily"
2937.200,2938.600," Blooms with gratitude"
2939.800,2941.100," because it appreciates"
2942.300,2943.300," so it's not"
2943.700,2944.400," just a kind of"
2946.000,2949.000," attentional training it's a hard training"
2949.600,2950.800," because the human heart"
2951.300,2951.900," starts with"
2952.500,2954.200," oh my gosh actually this is beautiful"
2955.500,2958.200," what's beautiful a grey morning and a city on the bus"
2958.600,2959.600," actually it's beautiful"
2960.600,2961.000," you know and"
2961.700,2962.800," meditation"
2963.100,2963.500," I remember"
2964.100,2966.600," vividly myself you know when I started a meditate"
2967.600,2968.400," pretty depressed"
2969.400,2973.300," very anxious living in London worrying about everything very full of shame"
2974.100,2976.300," and doing a PhD then I kind of"
2977.000,2984.800," loved the topic and hated the process you know as a I had I was having to read an eight languages"
2985.700,2986.000," and"
2986.900,2990.500," I've been trained in languages from a very young age so it wasn't"
2991.100,2992.100," it wasn't impossible"
2992.800,2994.900," but it was a lot of work my god"
2995.500,2997.700," and and just going to the library"
2998.300,3000.400," and heating out another big dictionary you know"
3000.900,3002.100," and I know that article"
3002.500,3008.400," in Portuguese I never wanted to read Portuguese but I have to because of the subject and somebody that a great scholar that has done"
3008.900,3011.100," it I could do it you know but it was it was in"
3011.700,3014.800," it wasn't really me you know but I was doing"
3015.500,3016.000," it anyway"
3017.200,3018.200," starting to meditate"
3018.900,3021.100," another day going to the tub"
3021.800,3023.100," you know through the rain"
3023.800,3024.200," and then"
3024.700,3025.100," ah"
3026.600,3027.300," rain"
3028.500,3029.400," the rain"
3030.000,3031.000," it's so beautiful"
3032.200,3034.100," the city streets shining"
3034.400,3036.000," that traffic sound"
3036.600,3038.700," that I associate with Callum misery"
3039.300,3040.600," actually it's beautiful"
3042.000,3043.600," like the siblings"
3043.800,3045.300," sound of traffic and"
3046.200,3049.900," is plain trees at London's full of that I also did was dismal"
3050.700,3051.000," no"
3051.900,3052.500," they're beautiful"
3053.600,3056.300," they're spreading up into the sky above the roofs and"
3056.800,3059.300," the rules are beautiful with a shining"
3059.600,3061.700," grey tiles Slate in the rain"
3062.600,3062.600," and"
3063.800,3066.200," just being aware"
3067.500,3069.300," is is somehow beautiful"
3071.900,3072.000," and"
3072.800,3074.100," it's not like I would get that"
3075.000,3075.700," every morning"
3076.300,3078.500," you know just having had my cup of nescafe"
3079.300,3081.300," gone down the stairs in the apartment building"
3082.200,3084.800," out into the street no it wasn't every morning"
3085.400,3086.500," but starting to get"
3087.200,3087.900," flickers of it"
3088.400,3091.300," kinds of it they made a big difference because it's a sort of"
3092.200,3092.400," yes"
3093.500,3096.300," the the way I ordinarily experienced"
3096.700,3098.300," my life is not"
3098.800,3099.900," the only way"
3102.200,3103.700," you know that's really"
3104.500,3107.600," yeah one of the big messages of meditation is that"
3108.400,3109.500," there's much more"
3110.300,3110.700," to our"
3111.600,3112.000," conscious"
3112.600,3113.200," awareness"
3115.100,3115.600," then we think"
3116.600,3118.200," we tend to live in a tunnel"
3118.600,3119.500," within the Great"
3120.000,3120.400," world"
3121.100,3121.800," of consciousness and"
3122.500,3123.900," think that's all that consciousness is"
3125.800,3127.000," and meditations very good"
3128.700,3129.300," teaching us"
3130.800,3131.400," there's a bit more"
3132.000,3132.500," to it"
3134.500,3135.700," okay when I feel like"
3136.900,3138.400," sharing a poem with you"
3139.400,3139.900," this is by"
3140.800,3142.800," Alfred Lord Tennyson"
3143.700,3144.700," okay Tennyson"
3145.200,3147.400," as far as I know is the only poet"
3148.100,3148.700," whoever got"
3150.000,3151.500," made a lord"
3152.100,3153.400," because of his poetry"
3154.800,3156.900," I think a number got knighted"
3157.500,3157.600," so"
3159.900,3160.200," um"
3162.100,3162.700," but none"
3163.600,3166.300," except tennis and became a lord"
3167.500,3167.700," and"
3169.500,3171.900," I'm just trying to think I don't think there's been a"
3173.500,3178.000," the equivalent of a knight is a lady in the imperial British"
3179.000,3179.500," system of"
3180.800,3183.500," what are they call it I currently what they call it but you know"
3184.400,3187.300," whatever that is that crazy system of titles"
3188.400,3191.400," so lady lord etc Baron Marquis"
3192.100,3192.300," whatever"
3194.000,3195.700," crazy but they still do it"
3196.000,3199.200," you know but I don't yet think there are some very great"
3199.900,3202.400," um women poets but I don't think"
3204.800,3206.100," I don't think any is"
3206.900,3209.900," yet been given one of those titles there's lady"
3210.700,3213.100," or Baroness or something for poetry"
3215.100,3217.900," okay so this is containers"
3218.600,3219.600," contemplating"
3221.000,3221.800," the end of his life"
3223.100,3224.200," and it's got a couple of"
3225.000,3225.900," sort of nautical"
3226.300,3227.100," terms in it"
3229.100,3230.600," it's called crossing the bar"
3230.900,3231.600," and the bar"
3232.100,3232.900," is a kind of"
3234.900,3236.900," like a sand bank"
3237.800,3240.200," that often a harbour would have some kind of"
3241.800,3246.600," there be they took about crossing the bar means you're going out to see you're going over this"
3247.300,3251.300," bar of land under the sea you're going beyond"
3252.500,3253.800," where the harbour mouth"
3254.500,3255.300," that's one thing"
3256.400,3258.600," another thing is there's a strange word born"
3259.900,3263.100," which is actually spelt b o u r n e"
3264.000,3264.500," and it means"
3265.700,3270.900," though from out our born of time and place it means sure"
3271.800,3272.800," or land"
3273.200,3274.000," again this meaning"
3275.100,3278.600," okay is there anything else you need to know let's see let's see"
3279.500,3280.400," crossing the bar"
3281.900,3282.600," sunset"
3283.500,3284.200," and evenings"
3285.900,3287.900," star and one clear call"
3288.800,3289.100," for me"
3290.200,3293.300," and may there be no moaning of the bar"
3293.900,3295.100," when I put out to sea"
3296.300,3298.100," moaning could a storms and waves"
3299.200,3304.000," sunset and evening star and one clear call for me and may there be no"
3304.600,3305.900," moaning of the bar"
3306.400,3307.600," when I put out to sea"
3308.500,3311.000," but such a tide as moving"
3311.700,3313.100," seems asleep"
3313.600,3314.600," two full"
3315.100,3315.800," the sound"
3316.100,3316.900," and fun"
3317.400,3320.900," when that which Drew from out the bound this deep"
3321.700,3322.600," turns again"
3325.700,3327.300," Twilight and evening Bell"
3327.800,3328.500," and after that"
3329.600,3330.200," the dog"
3331.500,3332.800," but may there be no"
3333.600,3335.900," sadness or Farewell"
3336.600,3336.800," when I"
3337.700,3338.300," embarked"
3339.800,3343.800," for those from out our born of time"
3344.200,3344.800," and"
3345.400,3346.100," place the Flood"
3346.400,3347.700," may bear me"
3349.800,3351.800," far I hope to see my pilot"
3352.100,3353.100," face to face"
3354.000,3354.800," when I have crossed"
3355.500,3356.000," the bar"
3365.700,3366.600," quite beautiful man"
3367.200,3368.000," yeah yeah"
3372.900,3373.600," here's why"
3374.400,3375.600," I really like that poem"
3376.400,3376.500," and"
3378.900,3381.400," yeah I'll do it again yeah I will good I will"
3382.200,3384.600," I'm just gonna say one little thing about it though"
3385.300,3387.100," here's the thing I can know I'll read again"
3389.400,3390.300," crossing the bar"
3392.600,3393.200," sunset"
3393.800,3395.100," and the evening star"
3395.500,3397.800," and one clear call"
3398.300,3398.700," for me"
3400.100,3402.700," and may there be no moaning of the bar"
3403.600,3404.700," bar when I put out to sea"
3405.500,3407.300," but such a tie"
3408.000,3409.200," but such a tide"
3409.700,3412.100," as moving seems asleep"
3412.900,3413.800," too full"
3414.200,3415.100," for sound"
3415.600,3415.800," and"
3417.600,3420.700," fun when that which Drew from out the boundless deep"
3421.500,3423.200," turns again home"
3425.000,3425.600," Twilight"
3426.300,3427.500," and the evening Bell"
3428.300,3429.000," and after that"
3429.900,3430.500," the dog"
3432.200,3433.900," but may there be no Sadness"
3434.700,3435.700," or fair well"
3436.600,3436.900," when I"
3437.500,3438.000," embarked"
3439.100,3443.900," for those from out our born of time and place the Flood"
3444.400,3445.700," they bear me far"
3447.500,3449.700," I hope to see my pilot"
3450.400,3451.300," face to face"
3452.300,3453.900," when I have crossed the bar"
3462.100,3466.400," here's his his his little practice pointers in it that I want to draw out"
3467.400,3468.000," that you know"
3468.500,3476.500," when that which Drew from out the boundless deep turns against her there's a boundless deep from which this body this mind this person has come and they're gonna go back to"
3477.100,3477.700," that's the image"
3478.600,3479.100," there's also"
3479.800,3480.600," we're living in this"
3483.000,3485.200," shore of time and place"
3486.900,3489.500," and though the flood may bare me far from"
3490.000,3493.900," that in other words I'm going to go away from this world of time and place"
3495.100,3498.300," I hope to see my pilot face to face I hope to see"
3499.000,3501.000," you know in other languages my maker"
3501.200,3503.300," face to face when I cross the bar"
3503.500,3507.100," the pilot is the guide you know guided ships in and out of the Harbour"
3508.400,3509.100," but the thing is"
3509.600,3511.200," here's the thing I think it's very"
3511.700,3514.900," apart from being incredibly beautifully written in such a incredible"
3515.700,3518.000," sort of rumination reflection"
3518.900,3519.700," about death"
3520.700,3522.400," and the adventure of death"
3522.700,3523.300," and of dying"
3523.600,3523.700," you know"
3524.400,3525.100," it also"
3526.000,3527.000," it to me is speaks about"
3527.800,3529.500," the deeper sides of practice"
3530.100,3534.000," that actually the wonder of practice the wonder of"
3534.900,3538.000," our human makeup that our practice can unlock"
3538.700,3539.700," is that we can"
3540.400,3542.200," see the pilot face to face"
3543.000,3543.400," without"
3544.600,3545.800," dying we can go to the"
3547.100,3548.000," the boundless deep"
3548.400,3548.700," without"
3550.100,3552.000," dying actually because it's always here"
3552.900,3554.900," what we are made of"
3556.100,3557.100," is um"
3558.700,3559.400,"not"
3562.200,3562.700," really"
3565.900,3566.000," okay"
3567.200,3567.500," ah"
3568.300,3570.900," we're made of all the stuff we're made of"
3572.500,3573.800," and consciousness is somehow"
3574.200,3575.500," enabled by what we're made of"
3577.100,3578.100," but at the same time"
3579.300,3580.900," it's possible to experience"
3581.600,3583.300," all of this material world"
3584.300,3584.700," as"
3585.900,3586.500," boundless"
3587.000,3587.400," deep"
3587.900,3588.900," Infinite"
3590.100,3593.900," reality that we can't name it says consciousness"
3594.700,3599.700," well no I don't think we can really some claim that I don't know maybe they're right maybe they're wrong who knows"
3600.300,3603.600," but you can get to a level of your own experience where"
3604.100,3605.000," you sense"
3605.800,3606.300," somehow"
3606.800,3608.600," a single fabric"
3609.500,3611.600," that all things are made of including you"
3612.700,3614.300," except the word fabric"
3614.700,3615.200," is wrong"
3616.900,3618.000," but it's kind of like"
3618.900,3619.400," that there's a"
3620.100,3621.000," single missed"
3622.000,3622.300," and"
3622.900,3624.000," that single this"
3624.400,3625.600," does not stop"
3626.400,3627.200," this finger"
3628.100,3630.400," being different from this fing"
3633.000,3633.200," so"
3635.100,3636.300," is paradoxical"
3636.600,3637.500," brain can't"
3638.400,3639.100," compute it"
3639.500,3640.600," but it's a reality"
3642.300,3643.800," where you're sort of"
3644.300,3646.800," seeing somehow what everything is made of"
3648.100,3648.500," you know and"
3649.200,3649.600," yogananda"
3650.300,3650.500," said"
3652.000,3652.400," life"
3653.100,3654.000," is a movie"
3654.600,3655.300," on a screen"
3657.100,3658.600," and it has a projector"
3660.400,3661.600," and the purpose of life"
3662.300,3663.300," is to turn around"
3664.100,3665.900," and see the projector"
3670.900,3674.200," I might have been wrong but that's what he said"
3674.700,3677.000," and I think he's talking about"
3678.000,3679.500," bonafide and Awakening"
3680.000,3683.200," experience all continued living their own"
3683.700,3685.500," where you actually can see"
3686.600,3691.100," that doubtless you know we're all in this room and we're seeing what we're seeing and"
3692.100,3692.500," we are"
3694.400,3695.600," What We appear to be"
3696.400,3697.700," and at the same time"
3699.000,3700.000," at the same time"
3700.900,3701.900," it's like that"
3704.900,3706.100,"infinitely thin"
3706.400,3710.500," image on the mountain Lane that's perfectly still at the same time so it's not"
3710.900,3712.500," the great thing to understand really about"
3713.000,3715.300," Awakening is that it denies nothing"
3717.200,3718.600," nothing has to change"
3719.300,3720.600," this is the beautiful thing"
3721.200,3722.600," about Awakening"
3723.400,3724.000," the fourth"
3724.500,3727.100," zone of practice the fourth in a practice"
3727.800,3730.600," as opposed to all the other three in all the other three"
3731.000,3734.000," there is some kind of improvement to be made"
3734.700,3737.600," maybe it's not right to put in an improvement there's some kind of development"
3738.200,3739.100," that's invited"
3739.700,3740.600," with mindfulness"
3741.300,3742.500," we can get better"
3744.200,3749.400," opening you know not getting so caught up in thoughts and feelings we can get better at"
3750.000,3750.900," that we can get better"
3751.700,3752.300," at finding"
3753.000,3753.600," a kind of"
3754.300,3755.400," impartial"
3755.800,3757.300," calm awareness"
3758.600,3761.600," that can sense what's going on without"
3762.800,3764.700," zipping itself up inside thinking"
3765.600,3767.300," and identifying with it so tightly"
3767.900,3769.600," can we can sort of get better at that"
3770.100,3770.600," we can get"
3771.800,3772.800," definitely we can get"
3773.400,3778.700," more in tune with our soul kind of thing we can get more connected we can feel"
3779.200,3781.600," you know like words worth on those Hills we can"
3781.800,3784.200," help that soul in US grow"
3784.800,3787.200," as soon too as part of zone to anyway"
3787.600,3790.700," we can we can discover more clearly how connected we are"
3791.200,3794.700," and feel more connected and connect more simply reach out connect more"
3795.200,3797.300," and be more vulnerable and open to connection we can"
3797.800,3799.000," develop in that area"
3799.500,3801.100," likewise in the third"
3801.800,3802.700," zone in"
3803.700,3804.200," flow"
3804.800,3808.300," we can sort of have that come on more because of our practice"
3809.400,3810.000," and we can"
3810.900,3812.500," kind of get better at"
3813.200,3814.700," it get get into it more deeply"
3815.400,3817.100," get it more regularly"
3818.200,3820.500," both in our meditation and in our life in general"
3822.000,3824.300," but when it comes to The Awakening thing"
3825.000,3828.500," you can't get you can't get you can't improve it you can't get better"
3829.800,3831.000," it just is"
3831.400,3832.600," and it's already here"
3833.300,3834.100," and that's why"
3835.000,3835.200," you know"
3836.200,3839.800," Schmucks like me and done no pressure at all some of those gets dropped by"
3841.400,3842.500," and on the other hand"
3844.600,3845.200," adapts"
3845.500,3848.800," spending you know 30 years on a mountaintop might not"
3850.000,3852.600," they probably get so close to it"
3852.900,3855.000," with the refinement of their practice"
3856.000,3858.000," that it doesn't really matter"
3859.400,3860.400," whether they see it or not"
3861.900,3863.400," but they might feel it does"
3863.700,3869.100," I've known people who have done a lot of practice for many years and I've never really quite seen"
3869.800,3870.900," it and then they knew they had"
3872.400,3873.800," even though they were very"
3875.300,3876.000," proficient"
3877.000,3879.500," well trained humans"
3881.600,3884.000," with a lot of mindful wisdom"
3884.800,3886.100," and a lot of clarity"
3886.900,3888.300," but they're just never quite"
3888.700,3889.100," had that"
3890.300,3892.000," last molecule jump"
3893.000,3895.200," or become large what was it"
3896.500,3898.200," spacious large diffuse or something"
3898.700,3902.000," that never quite had that little evaporator thing"
3903.500,3904.400," have a self is just"
3906.000,3906.700," it was never here"
3907.500,3908.800," you know they haven't quite had a"
3909.900,3911.100," and they probably and they know it"
3912.000,3912.200," you know"
3912.700,3912.700," but"
3913.200,3915.200," if they're very very good practitioners"
3915.900,3916.700," they don't mind"
3921.000,3921.300," okay"
3922.400,3923.300," so let us"
3925.600,3927.100," let us remember"
3927.800,3930.400," I'm just winding it back to where we started really that"
3933.000,3933.300," this"
3935.200,3936.400," this world"
3936.800,3937.300," scene"
3937.700,3938.000," without"
3939.800,3940.900," ordinary censor self"
3942.400,3942.600," it's"
3943.500,3944.300," a real possibility"
3944.900,3945.400," for humans"
3946.300,3950.700," and I do want to be stating that and do what I can to help"
3951.400,3952.500," us all know that that's"
3952.900,3953.700," true and real"
3954.500,3954.700," because"
3955.400,3959.200," personally I suffered a lot from not knowing that when I was a youngster"
3959.700,3961.100," and had had an experience like that"
3961.600,3963.400," and I had no idea that"
3964.000,3965.800," this was in the human repertoire"
3966.500,3968.200," I just knew it was real and true"
3968.800,3972.000," but I didn't know I took me 10 years to find anybody who sort of"
3973.000,3980.200," could speak I wasn't really looking admittedly very hard but it but it was 10 years before I found anybody who actually understood"
3981.400,3981.600," what"
3982.500,3984.100," I'd undergone and it was it was"
3984.700,3985.600," I wish I had"
3986.300,3988.700," had access to understanding about that"
3989.300,3989.700," quooker"
3989.900,3991.000," younger sooner"
3991.900,3995.900," and so I and I think you know we're now in a world that is much more open to"
3996.600,3998.600," awareness of this kind of thing so that's great"
3999.100,4000.700," and we we play our part in that"
4001.400,4001.700," all of us"
4004.300,4005.100," yes it's real"
4006.100,4007.500," yes it it is actually"
4008.400,4010.000," somehow closer to the nature of things"
4011.200,4013.100," than our ordinary way of experiencing but"
4014.000,4015.100," whether or not we see that"
4015.600,4017.500," we've all got to do this work"
4018.300,4023.100," on the gradual side the progressive side the gradually getting trained we've all got to do it"
4024.200,4025.800," why well lots of reasons"
4027.400,4029.900," but one just one would be that we've got this"
4030.500,4031.100," dangerous"
4032.300,4037.200," even inherited wiring that makes us very aggressive quite easily"
4037.800,4038.400," reactive"
4039.600,4040.200," aggressive"
4040.400,4040.500," in"
4041.800,4042.100," it's"
4042.400,4045.500," it's not and no I think nobody is immune from that"
4046.000,4046.800," because it's in our"
4048.200,4049.200," it's in our yeah"
4054.600,4055.300," we've evolved"
4056.200,4056.800," to have that"
4057.300,4057.900," and"
4059.500,4061.100," the more we're aware of that the better"
4061.600,4063.900," and and we've also evolved to be"
4064.900,4065.500," rather"
4067.200,4068.500," well to be easily"
4068.800,4072.200," kind of slightly as I was saying narrow minded it in our view of"
4073.400,4073.500," what"
4073.700,4076.600," life really is and can be narrow-minded"
4077.900,4078.000," and"
4078.800,4080.800," practice can hopefully make us a bit more"
4081.400,4081.700," open"
4085.000,4085.100," okay"
4086.300,4087.100," Luke would you"
4087.700,4090.000," give us a bit of movement with sitting a long time so"
4094.100,4094.500," thanks everybody"
4095.700,4096.400," good morning everybody"
4097.000,4102.100," all right let's just be kind of brisk and quick but we've done the last couple of days we'll start by beneath nothing"
4103.000,4104.900," and you can actually start in your space"
4105.700,4108.800," there's your eyes and as you may need to go side to side just be aware of your neighbor's"
4112.600,4115.800," just notice the difference in how this feels with either open or closed"
4116.900,4117.900," and of course you can do either"
4120.200,4121.300," and pick up the speed a little bit"
4124.200,4126.600," but really move from the ground from the four corners of both feet"
4128.000,4128.900," and your arms like ropes"
4129.200,4131.000," all right and your face really relaxed"
4131.600,4133.500," and your breath will come alive in time"
4135.500,4137.800," so draw a little bit more length into both in"
4146.300,4148.800," yes notice what your default is whether that's your nose or your mouth"
4153.200,4156.300," I'll send notice the default sound if you're quiet or you're a"
4156.600,4158.700," organically having a little bit of observable"
4159.700,4160.900," audible sound of"
4161.300,4161.800," wra"
4163.600,4164.400," and the heels can lift"
4171.300,4173.000," you can do a little flick out just like"
4179.400,4181.900," good and it's yeah it goes feels to take your arms up"
4185.400,4187.200," good and then just to lean over to one side"
4188.300,4190.100," good and then delete the other side"
4191.300,4193.400," bring good and then it kind of Reach back behind you"
4194.700,4196.200," and then reach out in front of you"
4197.200,4201.900," and God and reach out to the side you can probably look at your neighbor at this point make sure you'll probably have a little smile"
4202.300,4207.400," and doing that again and then come right back down Hills can go down and we'll do this for another 100 bounces you could"
4207.900,4209.400," count and I could say maybe um"
4210.300,4211.100," five rounds"
4218.100,4218.600," nice"
4219.300,4221.400," it's Phil your own body and feel the Collective"
4222.100,4223.200," balancing movement in the room"
4223.700,4224.200," three more breaths"
4229.700,4230.600," take a breath in this time"
4231.100,4231.600," do your nose"
4232.800,4233.600," breathe out of your mouth"
4236.300,4238.900," and make sound together as you breathe in nose or mouth"
4241.100,4243.600," and same thing makes sense together as you be without mouth or nose"
4245.000,4245.800," and then stop"
4246.900,4248.900," and don't make any sound but take a breath in"
4251.700,4253.200," and out into the floor"
4256.000,4257.100," bring your hands together"
4257.700,4258.700," and the same thing they'll make"
4258.900,4260.300," as little sound as possible"
4261.400,4262.400," to get a little bit of friction going"
4263.400,4264.900," and we're going to step a little bit wider"
4265.900,4266.100," today"
4267.400,4270.400," and you're going to keep stepping until you a little bit wider than your hips"
4271.100,4272.700," and just kind of back and forth and start to sit down"
4273.900,4276.100," so the weight this place is foot to foot"
4276.400,4276.500," right"
4277.300,4279.500," so think muscle and then bones"
4281.100,4284.500," bring both of your hands here like fists and pull your elbows back"
4285.100,4286.000," muscles sit down"
4287.700,4290.000," inhale through the bones up to the right hand"
4291.000,4292.900," and then soft to the bones the right palm"
4294.300,4294.600," good"
4294.900,4298.800," like there's ropes between your hands come back with the right fists up with the left that's muscle"
4299.500,4300.800," and Bone Excel"
4302.000,4304.700," now you kind of sink this up with breath with this two- more times in"
4307.000,4307.700," and soft out"
4311.300,4311.600," in"
4314.000,4314.800," Soft out"
4317.200,4318.700," one more time both hand and"
4320.800,4321.300," out"
4323.000,4324.200," an active"
4326.500,4327.100," and passive"
4329.200,4330.600," and then stand up Softly"
4331.400,4334.000," it's like diamond to your feet take your hands all the way up because look up"
4335.900,4338.400," and then just pass a little bit of space all the way down into the"
4339.100,4340.800," dantian or the gut or the key"
4341.400,4343.200," or the heart of this in words for it"
4344.000,4345.200," again inhale"
4346.100,4347.400," all the space"
4348.300,4350.000," all the way down into the ground through your body"
4352.800,4355.400," just that breathe in the room is very synced up in"
4358.200,4358.700," and out"
4361.300,4363.800," and stay with the hands right here and close the eyes"
4365.200,4367.700," just kind of inhabit your own personal space"
4369.400,4370.500," and in the Collective"
4371.400,4372.200," space of the room"
4380.700,4383.400," and in the interest of making it most of our time and Henry"
4384.000,4386.900," I'm going to turn it back over to him and goes the eyes thanks everybody"
4392.000,4394.000," imagine the hazey breakers"
4395.100,4396.200," over Pacific Beach"
4396.900,4397.800," at the end of an afternoon"
4399.300,4401.100," long strands of hair"
4401.800,4405.800," seemed to stream back from the waves as they plunged toward the shore"
4406.800,4408.700," and the air is misty with spray"
4409.600,4411.800," and that missed is suffused"
4412.600,4413.600," with light"
4414.600,4415.900," a golden mist"
4417.000,4420.400," through the Haze comes the line of slow flapping pellek"
4421.700,4424.700," the big birds beat their way up the coast"
4425.300,4427.000," swerving too and froze"
4427.400,4429.800," forming and reforming their line"
4430.400,4431.100," breading why"
4432.100,4433.300," then closing in again"
4433.700,4435.000," into tight formation"
4436.300,4438.900," like a squadron of Old War Birds"
4439.300,4441.500," they swing into the face of a swell"
4442.400,4445.600," as it Rises into a tall glossy wall"
4446.400,4447.900," and just as it's about to break"
4448.600,4449.400," they lift clear"
4450.400,4451.700," veering up and away"
4452.700,4456.000," and rewrite themselves like a group of words"
4456.700,4457.600," forming a thought"
4458.800,4460.300," and once again becoming a"
4461.000,4462.400," single sentence"
4463.200,4464.500," that moves out the coast"
4466.200,4468.600," then they swing to order another growing wave"
4469.200,4470.600," dipping down so low"
4471.000,4474.200," it seems their wing tips must touch the water"
4475.300,4477.800," narrowing into a single short line"
4478.600,4480.400," as the angle of view changes"
4482.300,4486.200," now they move across the blinding path where the lowering sun"
4486.800,4489.400," dazzles the water they flick her through"
4490.100,4491.000," it barely visible"
4491.900,4495.000," as if no more than a flapping motion"
4495.500,4498.800," without any ostensible solid thing"
4499.300,4499.700," creating"
4500.400,4500.900," the movement"
4505.100,4509.000," on the Far Side of the Broad highway of light once again"
4509.600,4510.700," they become solid"
4511.600,4514.300," dead fast in their beat over the water"
4515.700,4517.900," how can there be a site"
4518.100,4519.400," of such Grace"
4520.200,4521.300," and Grandia"
4522.400,4525.400," as this stretch of breaking waves"
4526.100,4527.600," with the great Birds"
4528.100,4529.000," flying over them"
4530.500,4531.400," the scene"
4532.100,4534.200," is of another order of scale"
4535.300,4536.300," then human life"
4538.000,4538.700," the birds"
4539.300,4541.700," glide across epochs"
4542.700,4543.600," commensurate"
4544.000,4545.500," in that powerful bodies"
4546.300,4547.200," with a scale"
4547.600,4548.300," of Ocean"
4549.200,4550.200," and tides"
4551.500,4553.100," yet moving with the grace"
4553.900,4555.200," of a calligrapher's brush"
4557.600,4559.200," what is this world"
4560.000,4560.900," but offers"
4561.300,4561.600," such"
4562.200,4562.900," beauty"
4565.400,4567.300," and what is our vision"
4568.300,4570.600," also made of this earth"
4571.800,4572.900," that can appreciate"
4575.300,4576.400," it whatever it is"
4578.000,4578.500," then"
4579.300,4579.800," is that"
4581.400,4582.700," zen is not us"
4583.700,4584.900," not our minds"
4585.500,4587.600," to be examined and no more intimately"
4588.800,4591.800," then is our minds knowing"
4592.400,4592.500," this"
4593.500,4593.900," beauty"
4595.500,4596.500," when we know that"
4597.800,4598.800," we know zeenath"
4601.500,4603.500," nor is this limited to nature"
4604.400,4606.600," one afternoon on a hot drive from California"
4607.400,4608.300," back to New Mexico"
4609.400,4610.500," we stopped for the night"
4610.700,4614.100," in a far-flung town in the far-flung town of Holbrook"
4614.600,4616.300," in Navajo County Arizona"
4617.200,4620.200," strolling along the road after long hours of driving"
4621.200,4623.000," I noticed a broad strip of"
4623.500,4624.500," cleared dough"
4624.900,4625.600," near the road"
4626.300,4627.300," it caught my eye"
4627.900,4628.900," and I scanned it"
4630.100,4631.900," then a faded windsock"
4633.000,4635.400," and a cluster of low buildings gave it away"
4636.200,4637.300," it was an air strip"
4638.400,4640.500," and not long after by chance"
4641.200,4642.400," I heard a distant"
4642.800,4644.400," high-pitched moan"
4645.200,4647.300," which made me look back just in time"
4647.900,4649.100," to see something white"
4649.600,4650.300," and fast"
4650.900,4652.400," disappeared behind the buildings"
4652.900,4653.900," and then reappear"
4654.900,4656.400," a twin propeller plane"
4657.000,4657.600," taking off"
4659.000,4661.200," years before I had worked in an airport"
4662.300,4663.100," and my ear"
4663.600,4665.800," still knew the sound of a twin"
4666.200,4666.900," in takeoff"
4668.000,4669.700," I watched the plain tip a little"
4670.700,4671.800," and then rise"
4672.800,4675.500," I watched it's nose wheel fold up"
4676.600,4678.900," and then the Winged wheels tuck up"
4680.000,4681.100," I saw it climb"
4682.000,4682.700," and bank"
4683.600,4686.000," turning slowly in its ascent"
4686.800,4687.800," before heading off"
4688.900,4690.200," perhaps toward Phoenix"
4691.100,4692.900," 150 miles away"
4693.600,4694.400," to the South West"
4696.000,4698.300," soon the pitch of the engines dropped"
4698.900,4699.900," as it settled"
4700.400,4703.200," into its straight and level flight path"
4704.700,4705.600," it's path"
4706.600,4707.300," was beautiful"
4709.800,4712.500," freely I watched the flying bird"
4713.100,4714.500," and sketched the track"
4714.800,4715.700," of its flight"

4729.400,4729.800," freely"
4730.600,4731.700," and watched the flying"

4734.600,4735.200," of his fight"
4736.600,4737.000," really"
4738.100,4740.000," we see the plane"
4740.300,4740.900," take off"
4741.700,4742.300," and settle"
4743.000,4744.400," into his evening flight"
4744.900,4745.200," home"
4747.000,4747.400," somehow"
4748.200,4749.400," the moment was perfect"
4750.700,4751.900," a middle-aged couple"
4752.900,4754.700," weary from hours on the road"
4755.600,4756.800," and also from tending"
4757.400,4759.000," and supporting the lives of their"

4760.800,4761.300," Sons"
4762.600,4764.100," and afternoons entering"
4764.900,4766.000," it's crystalline"
4766.500,4767.000," end"
4767.800,4769.600," just before the sun set"

4770.900,4771.400," the desert"
4772.500,4773.800," a quiet motel"
4774.700,4776.700," in the Dusty expanse of"
4778.200,4779.200," land and a plane"

4781.600,4783.600," from a remote astr"
4785.500,4786.000," heading back"
4786.600,4787.600," to a city somewhere"
4788.600,4789.600," where it's passengers"
4790.100,4790.700," probably had"
4791.200,4793.000," are conditions suburban homes"
4793.700,4794.300," waiting for them"
4795.800,4795.900," this"
4797.400,4798.000," was how it is"
4799.400,4799.600," just"
4800.100,4800.400," like"
4801.300,4801.600," this"
4803.200,4803.400," here"
4804.300,4804.600," was"
4805.600,4805.900," life"
4808.300,4811.100," to feel the intrinsic beauty of that scene"
4812.100,4812.900," was to be"
4813.700,4814.700," absorbed"
4815.300,4815.600," in it"
4816.400,4817.800," it was to stand in"
4818.900,4820.100," it as part of it"
4821.300,4822.000," the heart"
4822.700,4823.500," dissolved"
4824.000,4824.900," and opened"
4825.500,4826.100," in the face"
4826.700,4827.800," of such simple"
4828.800,4829.300," Powerful"
4830.200,4830.700," beauty"
4832.200,4833.800," and the sense of being separate"
4834.600,4835.200," in any way"
4836.700,4837.200," banished"
4841.100,4841.300," you know"
4842.200,4842.600," yeah not"
4843.100,4848.700," only nature lovely though nature of course is and how powerful it can be"
4849.200,4850.000," to walk through"
4850.400,4850.800," a wood"
4852.200,4853.500," simple walk through a wood"
4854.500,4856.000," simple walk through a park"
4856.500,4857.400," under the trees"
4858.100,4858.800," across the grass"
4862.200,4863.100," you know let it in"
4863.900,4864.000," but"
4864.900,4865.300," also"
4865.900,4866.700," walk down the street"
4867.400,4868.800," City street with buses"
4869.300,4870.600," drive down the city Street"
4873.300,4874.300," so it's a"
4875.600,4875.800," it's it's"
4876.800,4878.400," infinitely forgiving"
4879.000,4881.800," the reality of Awakening is infinitely forgiving"
4883.000,4885.700," infinitely awake infinitely welcoming there's a"
4886.300,4886.900," Zen teacher"
4889.800,4892.500," it's all the tip of my tongue her name"
4893.500,4895.100," she is a San francisco's end center"
4895.800,4897.300," Blanche heart move"
4898.300,4899.300," she had"
4900.000,4901.300," a powerful Awakening"
4902.200,4903.100," while attending"
4904.500,4907.600," and a nuclear disarmament rally"
4908.500,4910.300," and riot police were sent out"
4911.200,4915.000," and somehow she certainly found herself right at the front of the Crowd"
4916.100,4917.400," against the Shield"
4918.100,4921.800," of a Furious riot placement banging on the shield"
4922.500,4924.800," and she saw his face in his grimace"
4925.300,4925.900," and this"
4926.100,4927.800," shield coming right up against her"
4929.200,4930.900," and his trenches you know and"
4932.500,4932.800," suddenly"
4933.800,4934.700," it was all one"
4935.500,4936.500," it was just all one"
4937.300,4938.400," she's alright about it"
4938.900,4940.100," I forget where now but"
4940.700,4941.400," you know that"
4942.800,4944.100," in the midst of that"
4945.400,4950.800," aggression and and you know the real sort of forces of kind of Delusion and"
4951.900,4952.700," Greed and"
4953.200,4956.600," hate all concentrated in this riot line you know"
4958.200,4959.100," but it was all one"
4960.400,4961.100," she suddenly"
4961.900,4964.500," flipped you know that switch flipped the"
4965.100,4968.400," the sense of separatists of opposing forces"
4969.000,4969.400," gone"
4970.700,4971.300," yeah there's"
4971.800,4972.800," the cops and there's the"
4973.600,4975.300," demonstrators protesters"
4976.600,4978.500," but they're all part of something larger"
4979.800,4981.700," and it was unmistakable she got it and"
4982.300,4982.400," and"
4983.700,4985.400," that began her path of"
4986.500,4986.900," training"
4987.500,4988.700," as a Zen"
4989.500,4989.900," teacher"
4991.900,4992.000," so"
4993.700,4993.900," yeah"
4995.100,4995.700," what did I say"
4996.100,4997.600," it accepts everything"
4998.300,4999.200," it accepts everything"
5000.600,5003.700," which is again why we need the path of training as well"
5004.400,5005.900," because it accepts everything that's"
5006.600,5008.500," actually one of it's hazards"
5009.200,5011.400," you get the you know you get the"
5012.400,5013.800," quote unquote enlightened"
5014.200,5014.800," assholes"
5015.400,5017.300," yeah as they've been called you know"
5018.200,5021.400," mostly male teachers who really behave"
5022.200,5024.600," sometimes criminally you know not not just"
5025.200,5025.700," reprehensible"
5028.700,5029.900," and it's not"
5031.500,5033.400," it's not in any way to condone it but"
5034.300,5038.400," that doesn't necessarily by any means mean that they're not actually awaken"
5039.300,5040.000," unfortunately"
5040.800,5042.800," you know it can even be because they're"
5043.100,5045.600," they see it all is all one is all empty"
5046.500,5049.600," it doesn't matter as much as those people think it does if I abuse them"
5050.400,5050.600," you know"
5051.700,5053.200," you know you know what I mean I'm probably"
5055.000,5056.700," god forbid that I should ever fall into that"
5057.500,5059.900," era I don't think I will at this point but"
5060.500,5063.800," it could happen to anybody probably you know"
5064.400,5067.500," and but therefore we need the path of training as well"
5068.600,5070.300," we've got to have the where"
5070.900,5072.300," there was a lot of in"
5073.400,5077.700," naive Enthusiasm for spiritual practice in the west over the last seven decades"
5078.100,5079.100," it started coming in"
5079.800,5085.900," you know in a significant way maybe in the Twenties or thirties but really picked up in the 50s and 60s"
5086.500,5088.000," and there was a lot of naive"
5089.000,5090.100," it's going to say the world"
5090.800,5094.300," that's all wake up discover the oneness and then they'll be no more War"
5094.900,5095.700," and they'll be no more"
5096.300,5099.600," extractive industry and will live in a happy planet"
5100.600,5101.800," which is very possible"
5102.900,5104.600," in our last year it hasn't worked"
5105.400,5107.000," that that plan"
5107.600,5108.800," and some say it's because"
5111.100,5112.700," you know the ad that Maxim was"
5113.200,5116.700," changing the changing the forest one tree at a time"
5118.600,5120.000," alright like if everybody"
5120.600,5123.700," has some practice and wakes up or at least becomes more mindful"
5124.300,5127.500," with a better tended nervous system better regulated no system"
5128.700,5131.600," gradually that'll just spread and friends and be enough people"
5132.100,5133.200," and will save the forest"
5133.700,5134.700," one tree at a time"
5135.400,5138.400," but that didn't account for the forestry industry"
5139.000,5144.000," which is busy mowing down trees and you know"
5144.400,5146.500," so actually we're realising I think"
5146.900,5148.300," generally in the world today that"
5148.800,5149.900," yeah individual"
5150.800,5151.500," change"
5152.000,5153.300," and development and Growth"
5154.000,5154.700," is absolutely"
5156.500,5157.700," of great value"
5158.100,5159.500," but we also need to systemic"
5160.900,5163.400," change and collective change and it's not enough"
5163.800,5164.600," just to have one"
5165.400,5170.400," of either of those by the way you can change the system but it's if it's still populated by people"
5171.100,5175.200," driven basically by the three poisons as Buddhist Buddhism"
5176.500,5181.000," it's not going to that's not it's not enough to just change the system you've got to do both"
5181.700,5183.200," you know we've got to do both we've got to have"
5184.000,5185.400," social Reform and"
5186.200,5187.400," individual reform"
5188.100,5189.900," Revolution evolution whatever it is"
5196.000,5196.200," okay"
5197.900,5199.400," let's do a little bit of Q&A"
5200.700,5202.300," yeah okay Luke could we"
5203.300,5203.600," might"
5207.200,5207.700," from"
5208.100,5210.900," Bishop kind of from what you were just talking about with The Awakening and"
5212.200,5213.400," a little bit about"
5213.800,5214.400," some of the"
5214.700,5216.300," pitfalls potentially but"
5216.700,5217.800," not so much in that pain"
5220.200,5222.000," there's a lot of support I find"
5222.400,5223.500," presently for"
5225.800,5227.400," meditation mindfulness"
5228.000,5230.000," and sort of like the last chapters awaken"
5230.800,5233.000," right for the last chapter of the book is awake right"
5233.500,5235.600," but I don't necessarily find that to be"
5236.200,5236.400," hey"
5237.200,5238.200," after"
5239.600,5242.000," significant shifts of projects in this or Awakening"
5242.700,5243.000," especially"
5245.400,5248.500," this they say with you there's a lot of"
5249.600,5251.300," Rises up after that"
5251.700,5252.200," a lot to"
5252.800,5253.100," work with"
5253.800,5254.700," I mean there is that"
5255.700,5257.300," absolutely knowing that you talked about"
5258.300,5262.900," oneness as well as perfection really almost and everything but"
5263.500,5267.600," then they're funny things that rise up and I thought and was wondering a lot"
5268.400,5273.500," you know there isn't I don't necessarily it's hard to navigate that sometimes and find"
5274.500,5276.100," the infrastructure even within"
5277.200,5277.700," like that like"
5278.600,5280.700," okay why can I not remember anything"
5282.100,5284.700," anything okay like what happened to my memory"
5286.500,5289.600," it's just on for years now like well I ever be able to remember"
5290.000,5290.500," to get it"
5290.800,5291.900," you know things like"
5292.700,5298.400," but I don't know if you know that resonating is always okay okay- you know"
5299.600,5299.700," just"
5300.200,5301.000," sound like you know"
5302.200,5303.700," exactly the question is but"
5304.300,5305.200," I feel like there's"
5307.000,5310.300," there's a kind of maybe a need for some of that or"
5311.600,5311.900," maybe"
5313.000,5315.500," yeah and that's"
5317.100,5321.300," yeah that's great let me just let's it's just I'm just going to check out the heart of it"
5322.000,5322.200," the"
5322.900,5324.900," while there's a lot of support and understanding"
5325.600,5326.500," around mindfulness"
5327.200,5328.800," and generally meditation practice"
5329.600,5332.500," that has significantly grown in the fashion in the last 20 30 years"
5333.400,5335.800," they're still isn't that much around"
5336.700,5341.000," and then they met that may include going up to having some kind of"
5341.400,5343.200," glimpse of non-dual experience"
5344.200,5345.700," but that isn't a whole lot"
5346.100,5347.400," for what do you do beyond"
5349.400,5349.900," opening up"
5350.300,5351.000," to the nond"
5352.300,5358.400," that a whole thing to navigate basically what some were called the integration of that"
5361.400,5361.800," exactly"
5362.600,5363.000," how exactly"
5363.600,5363.600," so"
5364.500,5366.100," yeah it's a really good point and"
5368.700,5369.400," okay let me just"
5370.800,5375.300," see how I want to respond because it is a really important I mean the first thing that bubbling up is that"
5376.600,5378.000," but then does have that"
5378.400,5378.600," you know"
5379.300,5383.000," so then actually really does have that is one of the strengths of them is that it's got"
5384.100,5388.100," different kinds of methodology one of which the one that I personally know about is the current training"
5388.500,5394.500," which really is going beyond the what in zen is called the kensho moment which is a moment"
5394.800,5395.600," the sudden"
5397.500,5400.400," puncturing of the individual separate sensei itself"
5401.100,5401.200," so"
5402.600,5405.200," what the co-anchor is"
5407.100,5407.700," they think"
5409.500,5409.700," that"
5410.200,5413.300," actually that kind of experience is an initial"
5414.100,5414.800," portal"
5415.300,5417.900," to a training process you can then go through"
5418.600,5420.700," that might lead to another kind of experience"
5421.300,5421.900," in which"
5422.600,5427.300," you not only lose your separate self you kind of lose everything"
5427.800,5428.900," including Zen"
5430.200,5433.200," and you really see the fundamental"
5434.800,5436.500," there is a sort of bottom of the bucket"
5436.900,5437.700," that can fall out"
5438.600,5439.800," and then there's just isn't anything"
5440.500,5441.500," and when that's happened"
5442.300,5444.500," you are free to live"
5445.600,5448.100," a compassionate life in the world that's the theory"
5448.600,5450.100," and that you come right back"
5451.300,5455.100," really it sort of delivers you write back into the ordinary"
5455.800,5456.100," World"
5456.600,5458.400," you know something is different"
5459.200,5459.900," have been some"
5461.500,5462.300," of blown out"
5463.000,5464.500," but you're back in the Ordinary World"
5465.200,5466.100," and and and"
5468.500,5471.700," that's the treasures then is really that it can do that"
5473.400,5476.600," and I think zogan probably to bend to bend with can do that"
5477.100,5479.800," and I think many numerous training's can probably do that"
5480.400,5482.200," but it's true that it's harder to get"
5483.000,5486.800," clear instruction on that and certainly not widely available"
5487.300,5488.400," but that's probably because it's just"
5490.600,5497.300," well I'm just thinking in other systems you know if you go deep into the non-duality world which is basically redundant"
5497.500,5500.100," you know kind of out of the Hindu world the yo get well"
5502.100,5509.800," yeah I mean they talk about it you know sort of glimpses and then stabilizing and learning to navigate"
5510.400,5511.200," ordinary life"
5512.000,5512.300," without"
5513.300,5513.700," having a"
5515.100,5516.900," forget what you've discovered"
5517.500,5517.700," you know"
5518.600,5518.800," and"
5520.600,5521.200," it's really"
5522.300,5525.700," this this yeah it's it's it's it's okay there are"
5526.400,5527.400," I think generally"
5528.200,5533.100," people who need something like that will will gravity"
5533.400,5536.400," to it it's not it's probably not the hugest number of"
5537.100,5539.700," you know they'll somehow things will work out"
5542.300,5542.800," I think"
5543.400,5546.700," the situation that I was in is in 19 year old over 40 years ago"
5547.700,5549.500," I think it would be really different today"
5550.600,5550.800," you know"
5551.900,5552.800," just so much more"
5555.000,5559.100," available and awareness that this is possible but there's more to it because"
5559.600,5561.700," it's not uncommon actually when people have blown open"
5562.400,5564.300," that if they if they have trauma"
5564.700,5565.100," for example"
5565.900,5569.400," it'll it'll come up because it wants now to be released there's a"
5569.900,5573.600," the adaptive strategies are blown away and it's easier actually"
5574.100,5575.900," but man it helps us support"
5576.700,5579.000," that so you understand and get guidance and help"
5579.100,5580.300," in the process but anyway"
5581.300,5581.900," good point"
5582.600,5583.900," yeah anybody else"
5584.600,5584.800," yeah"
5585.200,5586.900," let's start here yeah leave us"
5589.500,5590.000," yeah I guess"
5593.300,5595.300," it was a very similar Direction so as a"
5595.800,5596.200," because they"
5596.700,5597.400," somewhat you know like"
5597.900,5598.500," no this because"
5599.700,5600.000," obviously"
5601.200,5601.300," you know"
5601.900,5606.700," it's super interesting and it's a work like all of the suing that's shifted perspective"
5608.800,5609.400," but I guess the"
5610.500,5611.300," average"
5611.800,5616.800," you know in a world that's still someone rewards and functions there's kind of entertainment"
5618.000,5621.300," like what is the right balance there right so once you attend that should"
5621.700,5624.500," be able to you know actually"
5626.200,5628.900," yeah yeah it goes through a very similar point"
5631.900,5633.100," that's like yeah"
5636.400,5637.000," some people"
5640.000,5640.300," from here yes"
5642.100,5642.800," every word"
5643.200,5643.400," is"
5643.700,5646.700," yeah okay thank you so just for everyone online"
5647.000,5647.900," the question is about"
5648.400,5649.900," again like well if"
5650.800,5650.900," if"
5651.600,5653.200," we have some"
5654.800,5657.700," sort of a hope of getting a glimpse"
5658.000,5659.300," of this Awakened state"
5660.200,5663.600," what then will it mean that I can't function in my normal"
5664.600,5668.000," modality and the the world that rewards"
5668.900,5670.100," the a to b model"
5670.900,5673.300," will be closed to me because I'll sort of lost all that"
5675.600,5676.000," honestly"
5677.100,5678.200," it doesn't mean that"
5678.600,5682.300," the fact is to see that everything is empty"
5682.600,5683.700," including yourself"
5685.500,5687.700," doesn't stop everything from a rising"
5688.300,5690.800," it it might it might do in the moment of impact"
5691.400,5691.500," but"
5692.100,5693.600," there are after it's all here"
5694.600,5695.800," you just know that it's empty"
5696.600,5699.600," but you but it's still a rising so a case in point is"
5700.100,5700.700," actually my"
5701.400,5705.100," my ongoing Zen master in Japan your mother Roshe"
5705.700,5706.900," is the chairman of"
5707.400,5711.100," and CEO of a big company three thousand employees"
5712.300,5713.300," at the age of 84"
5715.400,5716.300," powerful has ever"
5716.600,5718.300," and he freely runs a company"
5718.700,5719.300," you know and"
5720.300,5721.700," he's had a busy life"
5722.400,5724.700," throughout his zen process"
5725.200,5726.100," for the age of 16"
5727.500,5730.100," you know he had a very successful busy career"
5731.000,5731.800," and his Zen"
5732.300,5733.300," only help"
5733.700,5734.000," he said"
5734.600,5735.200," I wasn't"
5735.900,5737.000," the best mathematician"
5737.800,5740.200," I was a good student but not the best student"
5741.000,5743.300," and yet when I look back at my classmates"
5744.200,5746.300," sort of had more successful career than many"
5747.600,5747.900," pause"
5748.200,5749.800," every day without fail"
5750.400,5751.200," I sat still"
5752.100,5754.100," in zazen or Zen meditation"
5754.900,5755.500," for at least"
5756.100,5756.800," 25 minutes"
5757.500,5760.400," every day without faith and on a very busy day I did more"
5761.200,5765.900," and and it's it's that was his secret source"
5767.000,5768.300," so the answer is"
5769.000,5770.700," absolutely is okay"
5771.100,5771.600," and by the way"
5772.200,5773.900," you don't have to stop memory"
5774.400,5777.100," you might have a period yeah when it's really hard"
5777.700,5779.400," and that's okay but you come through it"
5780.000,5781.200," you know and and then you can"
5781.700,5783.600," pick it up put it down as you"
5784.000,5784.300," like yeah"
5785.700,5786.700," okay"
5787.400,5789.100," okay who else was that sorry you next"
5789.500,5790.900," yeah so reminds you know"
5791.900,5792.700," Eli okay"
5793.100,5793.800," and then I'll repeat"
5795.000,5797.200," it's not working is it that might okay"
5798.100,5798.300," no"
5808.300,5810.800," I was noticing"
5813.200,5814.200," I don't know I can be"
5814.900,5815.500," rolling through"
5817.200,5817.700," social media"
5818.700,5819.900," flooding myself with"
5820.900,5822.400," images of injustice"
5823.100,5823.600," of bring"
5824.700,5824.900," and"
5826.200,5827.000," have a little bit of"
5828.100,5828.900," Instinct that"
5829.600,5830.900," cultivated you meditation"
5834.000,5834.500," I don't need to"
5836.400,5836.700," I don't know"
5837.200,5837.600," breathing"
5838.300,5838.400," and"
5839.200,5840.100," doing some of my"
5841.100,5843.300," work packages and realising that I'm"
5843.700,5844.400," just interacting with"
5845.800,5846.800," my stream right now"
5853.900,5855.800," but sometimes that feels a little"
5857.900,5858.600," dishonest"
5859.500,5860.100," and I wonder"
5861.800,5862.700," there are some"
5866.200,5868.000," emotions and experiences that"
5868.900,5869.100," are"
5869.900,5871.600," inherently like not"
5872.400,5872.800," acceptable"
5878.000,5879.700," something that's an action oh"
5882.000,5883.400," how to avoid using"
5884.500,5885.000," meditation"
5887.300,5890.300," yeah yeah that's a that's a great point"
5890.700,5892.900," so just to repeat the question is basically"
5894.100,5895.100," Eli was saying like"
5896.000,5896.200," you know"
5896.800,5898.000," if I simplify like"
5898.500,5900.300," but there is in justice in the world"
5900.900,5902.000," and sometimes when I'm"
5902.900,5905.500," meditating I might get kind of mellow"
5905.900,5907.300," and not mind it so much"
5907.800,5908.200," something like that"
5908.800,5909.500," yeah how do we"
5910.200,5910.600," how do we"
5912.100,5915.500," remain sort of engaged concerned citizens"
5916.500,5918.100," if we're using this"
5920.200,5921.800," of meditating like an opiate"
5923.100,5925.500," yeah it's a really important point I mean"
5926.300,5928.600," the the set in a nutshell"
5928.800,5930.400," the answer is it's not"
5931.000,5933.000," it's mutually exclusive"
5933.600,5934.800," we may actually"
5935.300,5936.000," dial down"
5937.000,5938.400," over stressed nervous system"
5938.900,5940.400," and we may feel calm"
5941.200,5943.200," but that doesn't mean that"
5944.700,5948.000," we stopped all action and there are moral concerns"
5948.400,5949.500," is an old"
5950.100,5950.700," you know and"
5951.200,5951.800," even though"
5952.500,5953.700," I mean it's perfectly possible"
5954.500,5955.000," for example"
5956.300,5956.800," anger"
5957.900,5958.200," can be"
5959.200,5963.300," in Buddhism there's two flavours of anger there's anger with I'll will"
5964.000,5965.300," where you really want harm"
5966.000,5969.700," and there's anger without I'll will which is anger on behalf of"
5971.300,5973.400," some some wrong party"
5974.400,5975.600," and that second kind"
5976.200,5976.600," is good"
5977.200,5981.000," because there's a clean energy it can actually Energize us and motivate us"
5981.600,5981.700," so"
5982.800,5985.500," yeah to to extract I'll will"
5986.700,5986.900," from"
5987.500,5988.100," the picture"
5989.200,5991.100," and to extract grasping"
5991.600,5993.600," from the picture which is basically what"
5994.200,5995.600," we hope to be doing"
5996.600,5997.800," doesn't actually mean"
6003.200,6004.800," no more action in the world"
6005.500,6006.500," it can mean"
6006.800,6007.700," just as most"
6008.100,6009.800," and it can be more discerning"
6010.100,6011.400," and it can be Wiser"
6012.000,6013.400," precisely because it doesn't"
6014.600,6015.200," I'll will"
6015.600,6016.500," and grasping in"
6018.900,6020.800," it and I think you sort of hear that when you"
6021.100,6021.900," sometimes when you"
6022.600,6023.800," hear stories of really"
6027.700,6030.100," courageous motivated activists I mean"
6030.900,6034.800," I don't know early days of green piece or something when they're trying to stop whaling"
6035.300,6037.500," you know they were really working on behalf of"
6038.300,6040.100," suffering creatures as they saw it"
6040.500,6043.900," and you can sort of feel that they went to a lot of trouble and danger to"
6044.700,6045.200," to do that"
6045.700,6047.200," and they didn't have to be"
6048.600,6049.700," riled up by"
6051.500,6051.900," Fury"
6053.000,6055.600," they could have a strong kind of righteous"
6057.300,6058.000," motivation"
6058.400,6058.600," of"
6059.100,6060.100," texture you know"
6060.900,6062.200," which is kind of beautiful"
6063.500,6065.200," so I think it's a fair point"
6066.300,6066.900," but it's probably"
6068.000,6071.100," when the other could be for sure there might be times when we do"
6071.700,6077.600," we do get a bit sort of drugged by practice or something but that's a passing thing that's not a"
6077.800,6078.400," end point"
6079.000,6081.000," you know and it would come and go you know the"
6081.400,6083.900," might only be in the course of a retreat or sit or something"
6084.800,6085.400," temporary"
6086.100,6087.500," basically"
6088.700,6090.000," purposes to get clearer"
6091.100,6091.900," clear reminded"
6092.500,6093.900," and more open Hearted"
6094.100,6095.300," that's really the purpose"
6095.800,6096.000," not"
6099.200,6100.100," obfuscated"
6101.200,6102.400," by foggs of bliss"
6103.500,6103.700," you know"
6105.500,6106.200," okay any other"
6108.000,6108.200," okay"
6113.800,6116.100," totally Take That on comes to mind"
6116.700,6117.800," is a perfect example"
6118.600,6121.000," of an extremely calm person"
6121.500,6122.300," doing a lot of"
6123.000,6124.200," activists work for good"
6124.700,6125.200," throughout his"
6126.200,6127.100," life as a monk"
6127.900,6128.100," yeah"
6129.300,6129.500," yeah"
6139.800,6140.600," morale"
6140.800,6142.000," side that they"
6142.800,6143.000," yeah"
6144.100,6146.800," the only thing that I've heard and used myself"
6148.700,6149.800," at times is"
6153.900,6154.400," how to put it"
6156.100,6156.700," when it's like"
6158.000,6162.500," some sense of a decision and it's anything it's it's this or is this or maybe it's that"
6165.300,6167.000," open it up far wider"
6167.400,6168.200," it could be anything"
6169.500,6171.400," like not one or two or three options"
6172.700,6173.700," total open"
6174.200,6175.200," of options"
6176.100,6178.300," and then sit with that openness"
6182.300,6182.300," yeah"
6190.200,6190.300," but"
6191.200,6194.500," Paula let's keep it really brief for this basically a question with you"
6201.000,6201.100," so"
6201.900,6204.600," my experience that information will we have"
6205.400,6207.200," sweat lodges which allow"
6207.700,6207.800," us"
6208.300,6208.900," in those terms"
6210.500,6210.800," maybe"
6211.200,6211.600," able to"
6212.800,6215.700," in our approaches is essentially to enter the humility"
6216.500,6218.900," you surrender yourself through the mystery of life"
6219.500,6219.800," and that"
6220.400,6220.500," we"
6221.400,6222.400," Center ourselves just"
6222.900,6223.600," right where we are"
6225.500,6226.000," and I'm up with"
6226.700,6226.800," discovered"
6227.900,6228.000," full"
6228.700,6229.000," about"
6229.500,6230.300," you know how do we deal with"
6230.900,6231.900," injustice in the world"
6232.800,6233.600," we're my"
6234.700,6234.800," transfer"
6235.500,6235.500," to"
6236.400,6237.300," combine where I saw"
6238.000,6238.400," that the"
6238.700,6240.900," polar causing harm are not Awakened"
6241.400,6242.000," and so I thought"
6243.200,6243.800," simply dead you know"
6244.100,6246.700," our response wasn't to be reactive to their injustice"
6247.900,6253.300," of love yes he opens and say okay and then about the integration process"
6254.300,6255.800," similar thing where it's like okay"
6256.700,6257.500," the woken to this"
6258.200,6258.800," part of life"
6259.200,6259.400," now"
6259.900,6265.400," how do I respond and a lot of it is getting out of our own way as I well whatever is in my body the trauma"
6266.100,6266.800," eating themselves"
6267.200,6267.900," being aware of them"
6269.100,6269.400," and love"
6269.800,6270.200," and open"
6275.300,6276.600," that's going to come from"
6276.700,6277.900," that place down yeah"
6278.700,6282.400," yeah that's right nice thank you for my own personal journey"
6283.800,6284.800," fluctuate between"
6285.200,6289.000," Awakened and being contracted and what I'm finding"
6289.400,6293.000," is important right now for myself it's like a hero journey and go into the"
6293.300,6294.100," mystery of the world"
6294.900,6295.800," get lost and"
6296.100,6298.700," you come back and now finding community that this part of my life"
6299.000,6299.800," is really important so"
6300.400,6300.700," this is"
6301.300,6302.900," going to find journey to find groups"
6303.400,6303.500," of"
6304.400,6307.100," school that Awakening or seeking or going through that journey"
6308.300,6308.800," in order for myself"
6310.300,6310.600," yes"
6311.800,6313.400," that's that's a great point so"
6314.100,6314.900," Paulo was talking about"
6315.700,6317.500," so can my brain"
6318.300,6320.600," get it right for those who didn't hear"
6321.200,6325.900," last part was about the integration process being so greatly helped by community"
6326.900,6329.300," and connecting with others going through similar processes"
6330.500,6332.400," and the first part was about um"
6333.000,6333.400," actually"
6334.200,6336.700," when we've had some blast of"
6337.200,6339.300," true nature of things"
6341.200,6341.700," humility"
6342.300,6345.600," around there and receiving whatever wants to arise"
6346.200,6346.800," thereafter"
6347.400,6347.800," and not"
6348.200,6353.400," thinking we got a we really got to do a whole lot we it's our humility that allows us to"
6354.200,6356.100," a developed beyond that"
6356.400,6356.600," and"
6357.200,6359.100," and also there was a rather than"
6361.200,6366.100," rather than being reactive against forces of injustice"
6366.600,6367.000," actually the"
6367.400,6368.300," have compassion for them"
6369.000,6371.200," because they are lost in suffering as well"
6372.100,6372.200," you know"
6372.900,6375.100," and that's absolutely right on beautiful thank you"
6375.600,6375.800," yeah"
6376.600,6376.700," yeah"
6385.700,6386.000," and"
6386.400,6387.200," something that is"
6387.500,6389.300," frequently talking about on there is that"
6391.000,6392.200," once you realise that"
6393.200,6396.500," self is an illusion that the flip side of that point is that free will is also"
6397.500,6398.400," and I just wanted to ask"
6399.000,6399.900," your perspective on that is you"
6411.700,6413.500," I'm going to exercise my free will"
6417.600,6419.200," know I you know what I"
6421.000,6422.300," I have to admit"
6422.700,6424.400," I have not thought deeply about"
6425.400,6425.900," actually"
6426.500,6428.000," I I know you know"
6428.800,6429.200," that"
6430.400,6431.300," they all say"
6431.900,6432.800," free will doesn't exist"
6433.600,6434.300," but I believe"
6435.200,6435.900," we can"
6437.300,6439.000," find a way to be more open"
6439.400,6443.100," I think in probably in large Strokes a lot is determined"
6444.000,6446.000," socially economically and culturally and stuff"
6446.800,6448.400," of course and genetically"
6449.500,6453.700," but also I think we can we can find openness"
6454.000,6454.600," in our hearts"
6455.700,6456.400," I think we can"
6457.100,6459.200," I don't know if that's free will or not but"
6460.100,6463.900," I know I don't really want to go there I'm sorry I can't speak to it well"
6464.900,6465.100," that's"
6466.600,6467.500," probably not free will"
6467.900,6469.500," but it feels like it"
6471.300,6471.700," but women"
6472.200,6475.600," folks I think we should now I wanted to end with some quiet"
6476.700,6479.700," and I know there's how many more questions are there"
6480.000,6480.200," or"
6481.700,6482.000," quit one"
6486.400,6488.000," yeah yeah no that's huge"
6493.600,6497.400," the main thing I would say about it was like how do you define emptiness in Zen"
6497.600,6500.600," the main thing to know about empties is is not"
6501.300,6501.800," an idea"
6502.500,6503.300," it is not"
6503.900,6504.500," an idea"
6505.300,6505.400," don't"
6506.100,6506.700," think about it"
6507.500,6508.200," it's an experience"
6509.400,6514.200," that's a number one thing and actually choking on trumpets said it very well"
6515.300,6515.500," you"
6516.400,6516.900," suddenly"
6517.500,6520.800," the bad news were that you fallen out of an airplane"
6522.700,6524.800," the bad news is you haven't got a parachute"
6525.900,6527.600," the good you the good news is"
6528.200,6529.000," there's no ground"
6531.400,6531.500," yeah"
6533.000,6534.800," one last thing"
6535.500,6535.900," I want to say"
6537.400,6537.600," how much"
6539.000,6539.000," the point"
6539.800,6540.000," actually"
6543.800,6544.300," thank you very much"
6549.100,6550.300," thank you all for for coming"
6551.500,6552.800," making this happen okay- let's"
6553.600,6554.200," let's be quiet"
6993.700,6994.500,"okay"
6997.100,6997.500," so"
6999.300,6999.500," yeah"
7000.100,7002.200," let the let the world come to meet you"
7003.500,7004.300," as you go out"
7004.900,7006.100," thank you very much Luke"
7006.400,7009.900," thank you very much crossings for having us thank you very much Jeremy"
7010.600,7012.100," there's so much work behind the scenes"
7012.700,7013.500," and thank all of you"
7014.100,7015.300," thanks to all of you for coming"
7016.400,7016.600," great"
7017.300,7017.800," to do with you"
