177.600,180.700," I'm still looking at this so good to see this"
181.300,186.800," there's messages I love getting it I got I love getting these weather hits from around the world I don't know what the"
187.600,190.600," just the sense of what this glow has going on in it"
191.400,193.200," good to tune by the way that's some"
194.900,195.700," is that Canada"
196.200,198.200," I'm so for my ignorance or"
199.200,201.300," assuming it's somewhere in North America"
202.100,203.200," where it's still wintry"
205.900,208.300," but just a reminder that"
209.600,211.600," all of us in all these different"
212.500,214.900," places there were all actually in the one"
216.600,217.800," uh same"
218.300,218.700," here"
219.000,222.100," there's a what what is known in"
222.400,222.700," in"
223.300,225.200," some of the traditions and then"
226.200,229.400," as the original nature are original nature"
230.300,231.900," of fundamental nature"
232.700,233.100," you know which"
234.200,236.800," you know to interpreted in different ways I mean you can say"
237.500,239.100," in a certain sense it's um"
240.500,244.400," our original nature some say it's a primordial awareness"
245.700,248.500," that all things are arising within"
249.500,250.400," and some say"
251.700,252.800," well other things"
253.200,253.400," it's"
255.000,256.000," but whatever it is"
256.600,256.700," it's"
258.200,261.000," all of this experience that we're having"
262.200,262.500," is"
263.100,264.800," either a rising in it"
266.400,269.900," in some views or is actually it"
271.900,273.100," arising in the form of"
275.000,276.600," that we experience in other words"
277.300,280.800," I mean maybe this sounds a little bit subtle and abstract but there's a slight difference between"
281.400,282.400," the sense that is"
282.800,284.900," probably easier to get our heads around that"
285.500,288.800," there's a great awareness that our awareness is part of"
289.600,291.700," in which all our experiences are rising"
292.700,296.000," and sorry I'm jumped in so deep so quick I didn't mean to actually but"
299.000,301.600," I thought I had to explain how we're all in the same"
302.200,303.700," place in a certain sense"
304.600,310.900," that so let me just say that again that there's a sense in which that we can actually get relatively easily I think that"
311.900,313.200," you know we're seeing stuff"
315.300,316.200," and we're experiencing"
317.000,320.200," in other sense channels as well we're feeling our bodies"
321.400,321.700," where"
322.900,324.100," we're hearing sounds"
324.800,325.500," and we're seeing"
327.600,330.300," and all of those three sense experiences"
331.200,331.600," are"
333.400,334.800," arising in"
336.200,336.900," awareness"
337.800,338.800," there are appearing"
339.600,343.500," all the things that we see for literally in front of us and you know"
344.500,345.400," our appearing"
345.800,346.100," in"
346.900,347.700," awareness"
349.300,351.300," so as we look at"
351.600,354.800," what is before us you know perhaps in a room or whatever"
355.900,357.300," you know whatever objects are there"
358.100,361.100," the experience of seeing them is a rising"
364.100,366.900,"in a medium is a rising in"
367.800,368.700," awareness"
370.400,372.900," and that awareness that each of us has"
373.900,374.200," is"
375.700,376.500," in some views"
377.900,379.100," part of or"
379.900,380.400," is actually"
381.000,382.500," you know really the same as"
383.500,384.400," a vast"
385.200,387.000," all encompassing awareness"
388.200,391.200," in which all things all manner things"
392.000,392.600," arise"
394.000,394.300," and"
396.100,398.200," and that is our original nature"
399.700,400.800," so the original nature"
401.500,403.200," of all things all things are"
403.900,406.000," provided this opportunity to exist"
407.100,408.100," by virtue of"
408.500,409.800," arising in"
410.800,413.400," a vast primordial timeless spaceless"
414.400,416.300," infinite boundless timeless"
417.300,417.900," awareness"
419.200,420.100," okay so that's a"
420.600,422.300," that's why we're all in"
423.400,424.000," we're all here"
425.300,427.200," when we say here we mean the same thing"
428.100,429.700," so the weather is Saskatoon or"
430.400,435.600," or or Montego Bay wherever that is in Jamaica that somebody is in"
436.200,437.800," you know it's it's actually"
439.300,439.600," here"
441.200,441.300," so"
442.100,443.700," we can all be in these many little"
444.300,446.500," zoom cells that are appearing you know"
446.900,447.400," on the screen"
448.100,450.100," and all the on all the different places that those"
451.400,452.200," reference"
454.800,455.500," but actually"
456.700,457.200," we're all"
458.200,458.500," just"
459.400,459.700," here"
463.400,463.500," and"
466.100,467.200," are meditative"
468.200,468.800," journey"
470.300,472.400," in as many kinds of journey we make in life and"
473.000,476.400," one of them could be the meditative journey or the contemplative journey"
477.800,478.500," and that is"
479.000,479.700," always"
480.200,482.300," a journey back a path back"
483.900,484.000," to"
485.400,488.400," the place that we actually never left anyway"
489.800,492.000," so it's a journey this said to be"
492.900,496.200," you know the most important journey of a lifetime and there's no journey at all"
497.500,498.000," just to"
499.200,500.400," where we have always been"
501.000,501.200," here"
502.800,503.000," here"
505.200,507.900," so let's do it now let's do the little journey"
509.300,512.700,"the little journey that isn't the journey or the huge journey that isn't a journey"
514.600,516.900," let's let's let's invite ourselves"
518.300,519.700," once again to"
521.700,522.400," to make"
522.800,524.000," that blessed"
525.100,526.000," pilgrimage"
529.600,530.500," bye going now"
531.500,532.500," and by"
534.400,536.200," and sometimes going a long way"
536.600,537.200," as well"
538.400,538.700," still"
540.000,540.900," going nowhere"
541.200,542.600," but what an enormous journey"
543.900,546.400," what a blessed journey what an important journey"
550.000,551.300," so there was set up in our"
552.300,553.600," meditation position which"
554.500,556.400," I and I can see many of you have already done"
557.400,557.900," but do it"
558.800,560.500," do it with a lot of flexibility like"
562.000,564.700," I've said this before but I want to reiterate it"
565.400,568.000," don't think that there's a hard line between"
568.800,572.000," kind of when I'm not meditating and now I am meditating"
573.000,573.600," that would"
574.400,577.300," that would be a a purely personal"
578.300,578.600," I mean"
579.200,582.200," kind of imagine and and self-created line"
582.700,583.900," really isn't a line"
585.300,586.900," because it's just about our"
588.600,591.700," meditation is only an opportunity to return"
593.000,596.000," to return our awareness to"
599.000,600.700," what's always been here anyway"
603.600,604.400," just coming back"
607.900,609.600," not really coming back to just"
609.800,610.500," noticing"
613.900,614.800," what's always here"
618.300,619.200," instead of"
620.000,621.500," very nature of our being"
624.100,625.000," so be"
625.500,625.900," gentle"
627.100,627.600," in the"
628.000,628.400," opening"
629.100,630.700," moments of meditation whatever you"
631.600,632.600," need to do to"
634.800,635.500," feel comfortable"
650.400,652.000," learning yourself he's into it"
657.700,659.800," if you're sitting upright see if you can"
660.800,662.700," yeah be balanced"
665.100,665.600," and very"
666.600,667.400," very relaxed"
669.000,670.500," we want the sense of"
672.500,673.200," you know like a"
675.000,676.900," a sand Dune as it's"
678.500,680.200," it's sort of perfect angle of"
681.000,682.000," of repose"
682.400,682.600," you know"
683.300,686.600," or angle of incline or whatever it's called I forget and the term"
687.600,688.700," but there's a natural"
689.900,690.800," slope"
691.700,692.400," that the sand"
693.800,694.900," comes to rest in"
695.500,698.000," we want something similar as if"
698.900,700.900," as if the body were a heap of sand"
702.400,703.400," and it knows"
705.600,708.100," quite spontaneously it's own"
709.400,710.400," center of gravity"
712.800,715.100," we're just allow it to find that"
719.000,719.700," and let everything"
721.500,722.300," everything kind of"
724.200,725.100," depend"
725.400,726.900," anh dang"
733.000,734.700," from that access"
744.800,745.300," I mean"
746.500,748.900," coming into the angle of repose"
750.900,751.600," all around"
757.200,757.600," data"
759.900,760.700," restful"
761.400,761.900," body"
767.300,768.000," and as we're"
770.000,770.900," coming into that"
771.300,771.700," check"
773.600,775.300," any areas that are not"
775.900,776.400," restful"
784.100,786.600," and now them to be present as they are"
801.100,802.300," let them being included"
804.700,805.900," what could be"
828.100,829.600," that jaw and throat"
830.300,831.300," be relaxed"
837.200,837.500," let"
837.800,838.200," and"
839.000,840.200," fingers be relaxed"
848.900,850.800," that shoulder and arms be relaxed"
867.700,868.300," and let your"
869.000,869.300," seat"
871.100,871.600," become"
872.400,872.800," heavier"
873.200,874.600," feel more pressure"
875.900,876.800," in your seat"
878.400,880.300," as the upper body relaxes"
892.700,895.100," just notice that you can really trust"
896.400,897.700," the seat beneath You"
900.700,902.200," it's not going to let you down"
1011.600,1013.100," really resting"
1020.100,1023.000," perhaps now sensing the whole of your body"
1025.800,1027.300,"as a warm field"
1038.900,1039.600," and"
1041.400,1042.700," perhaps now also"
1044.800,1046.100," being aware of the"
1046.500,1048.500," the space of Sound around"
1049.200,1050.100," all around you"
1054.200,1055.300," so there is"
1057.200,1058.900," the warm feel of the body"
1062.200,1063.700," and there's the space"
1065.500,1066.300," around it"
1070.600,1072.200," in which sounds arise and"
1075.200,1075.900," other things"
1085.100,1085.100," and"
1087.300,1089.100," a little invitation here is"
1090.200,1094.200," let them become one let them kind of fuse or melt"
1095.600,1097.400," and to just a single"
1099.600,1102.200," single gently glowing kind of"
1103.600,1105.800," hello ball of a awareness"
1106.300,1106.900," fear"
1108.000,1108.100," or"
1109.500,1110.600," glow"
1113.000,1115.800," like one awareness gently glowing"
1117.800,1119.000," through this"
1120.900,1123.500," field this area that stone"
1125.800,1127.600," of soft Sensation"
1348.200,1350.900," there's no need for things to be different"
1352.600,1354.700," there's no need to change anything"
1357.400,1358.000," where"
1361.500,1362.400," we're allowing"
1364.200,1365.600," things to be as they"
1367.800,1368.600," are allowing"
1374.400,1375.300," and then we"
1377.300,1378.700," we let ourselves"
1379.800,1380.500," taste"
1382.500,1383.200," allowing"
1388.000,1389.500," we let us ourselves"
1390.500,1392.300," experience what it's like"
1395.900,1396.800," to be simply"
1398.200,1398.700," allowing"
1404.800,1406.600," not opposing anything"
1411.300,1412.500," so even if there are"
1413.900,1415.400," places in us that are"
1416.200,1417.600," you know perhaps tight or"
1419.100,1421.000," perhaps have some kind of resistance"
1423.000,1424.100," here's an active"
1424.700,1425.400," in them"
1427.100,1428.500," we don't oppose them"
1429.700,1431.000," not in the least we"
1432.300,1433.900," we fully allow them"
1439.900,1440.000," where"
1441.400,1442.800," we're really releasing"
1445.200,1446.200," any opposition"
1449.200,1449.800," to anything"
1451.500,1452.000," right now"
1465.400,1466.000," my"
1467.300,1470.400," in my being a little radical in a certain way"
1472.400,1474.400," we might be more used to"
1477.900,1479.200," having certain kinds of"
1481.000,1482.400," opposition or"
1483.400,1483.700," at least"
1484.400,1484.900," control"
1486.700,1487.300," the way"
1488.500,1489.900," or habituated to"
1493.600,1494.700," but actually this"
1496.500,1497.800," kind of allowing"
1499.500,1501.500," is yeah radical"
1504.200,1507.500," is just letting all that"
1509.700,1512.100," kind of apparatus of control"
1514.200,1515.300," letting it be"
1517.900,1519.400," we don't have to get rid of it"
1519.500,1519.900," actually"
1522.200,1523.300," bizarre allowing"
1525.100,1526.400," can be more general"
1527.700,1528.800," even than that"
1532.700,1533.500," very simply"
1536.200,1537.400," oppose nothing"
1558.400,1560.500," and can be a way of"
1562.000,1564.000," actually letting ourselves be"
1565.400,1566.100," undone"
1574.000,1574.800," and it's okay"
1641.300,1644.100," it's okay because we're just"
1645.500,1647.600," releasing ourselves back"
1649.700,1652.600," into something that was always here"
1653.700,1654.300," anyway"
1657.800,1659.100," from the very beginning"
1670.300,1671.900," something timeless"
1688.600,1689.200," something"
1690.800,1692.100," immensely peaceful"
1725.700,1726.200," and think"
1728.200,1729.700," very light"
1730.200,1731.100," and easy"
1772.500,1773.900," something that isn't really"
1775.400,1776.000," a thing"
1780.600,1782.300," that's still seems to"
1785.400,1786.600," accept everything"
1787.300,1788.300," allow everything"
1792.800,1794.400," for the no demands"
1796.000,1797.500," it makes whatsoever"
1803.800,1805.000," no requirements"
1810.500,1812.100," it's an undoing"
1850.000,1853.000," assets some kind of universal allowing"
1983.100,1983.800," per"
1984.500,1986.900," if thoughts and feelings come up"
1988.800,1989.500," as 100%"
1989.900,1990.400," fine"
1991.700,1992.700," they're allowed"
1994.200,1997.000," if it helps you might just note yourself"
1998.200,1999.800," thoughts or thinking"
2003.300,2004.600," feeling emotion"
2014.100,2014.600," sometimes"
2016.700,2019.500," we're aware of particular body sensations"
2022.400,2024.600," you can just try labeling body"
2028.500,2029.000," sometimes"
2030.500,2031.800," we're aware of sounds"
2033.500,2034.200," you can label"
2034.600,2035.500," here in"
2038.700,2039.500," just as"
2040.400,2041.400," little reminders"
2041.800,2043.100," using"
2044.200,2046.300," labels just as reminder"
2050.600,2052.400," of what is"
2053.700,2054.400," arising"
2054.700,2055.000," and"
2056.100,2056.800," awareness"
2070.500,2073.500," and if you eyes are open as you sit you can"
2074.700,2075.000," you can"
2075.500,2079.400," remind yourself now and then when appropriate that you're seeing"
2081.100,2082.000," screen"
2083.100,2084.300," of sight"
2084.500,2084.900," as"
2086.600,2088.500," as material as content"
2089.800,2090.500," seeing"
2101.500,2103.900," and all of these facets of"
2105.000,2106.000," experience"
2107.500,2108.300," they're actually all"
2110.100,2111.600," arising and the same"
2114.300,2115.000," whatever it is"
2115.600,2116.800," space of"
2119.400,2119.900," the same"
2120.700,2121.200," condition"
2122.700,2123.300," of allowing"
2126.500,2127.100," the same"
2128.500,2129.800," allowing this"
2308.000,2310.400," not a lovely sitting"
2311.600,2312.300," going on"
2314.000,2315.400," well we'll be moving"
2317.300,2319.700," will be moving toward our break"
2323.100,2326.200," any time soon or write about now so"
2327.800,2332.000," I invite you if you're if you're kind of in an interesting place keeps sitting"
2333.400,2333.800," if you're"
2335.100,2337.500," feeling you're an interesting place but you want to"
2338.100,2339.300," do something else for a while"
2340.100,2342.600," then you can bring the sit to a curse"
2344.200,2348.100," it's just what I'm personally going to do and then we're going to have a little break"
2349.000,2352.800," and it's now 39 probably shortly 40 minutes"
2354.500,2362.900," past the hour so let's reconvene a little bit more let's say a 48 minutes after so we got a bit of time"
2363.600,2365.700," we want to make a cup of tea or anything like that"
2366.800,2370.000," see you in eight or nine"
2370.600,2371.600," minutes time"
2372.800,2374.100," however you choose to"
2374.800,2377.600," spend that time where they're with more sitting or something else"
2378.600,2380.200," just be gentle and"
2381.100,2381.900," the best you can"
2383.000,2383.500," aware"
2384.800,2385.000," okay"
2386.200,2386.500," thank you"
2708.400,2709.900," okay so"
2711.300,2713.400," I think with we're all gently coming back"
2715.500,2715.800," just"
2717.300,2718.800," weigh the moment longer"
2720.200,2721.300," as people Returned"
2736.300,2736.600,"uh yeah"
2738.200,2740.100," yeah okay great thanks everybody"
2743.200,2745.100," hope you hope you enjoyed the sit"
2745.500,2745.700," and"
2747.200,2748.000," or you know"
2749.200,2751.900," in some way it was fruitful for you or helpful"
2752.800,2754.500," I used to often sit"
2756.100,2758.100," and feel that I'd absolutely got nowhere"
2758.400,2759.000," you know and"
2759.900,2761.700," that it was just one big sort of"
2762.900,2763.300," I don't know"
2764.000,2765.200," male strong of"
2766.600,2767.400," of confusion"
2768.400,2770.200," and yet I get to the end of it"
2770.800,2771.100," and"
2773.200,2774.200," and and and feel"
2777.100,2777.300," better"
2778.500,2780.500," just better like I've done something"
2781.600,2782.300," worth doing"
2783.700,2785.400," just having the space of"
2788.000,2788.400," not"
2789.500,2791.700," not being out with the engaged"
2792.700,2796.500," or in inwardly entangled you know was"
2798.300,2802.200," maybe being actually inwardly entangled during it"
2802.700,2804.700," but still the fact that I sat still"
2805.600,2806.900," had a value"
2807.600,2811.600," and in time I mean there are of course different set of"
2812.600,2821.000," people with interpret what that value might be in different ways but I I come to think that just the fact of being still"
2822.200,2822.900," is a"
2824.500,2826.200," is in acknowledgement somehow"
2827.500,2828.900," that we definitely may not"
2829.400,2832.700," feel it to be over time but it is an acknowledgement of the"
2833.500,2834.600," gift of being alive"
2835.400,2837.100," it's a recognition somehow"
2837.700,2839.700," that being alive itself"
2840.700,2843.900," is worthy to be recognised and acknowledged"
2844.800,2845.600," if you see it I mean"
2846.100,2848.600," because you know as when we're so rushing"
2849.500,2849.700," through"
2851.100,2854.200," the things we rushed through about outwardly and in our minds"
2855.100,2857.900," you know the one thing we're not really aware of"
2858.800,2862.200," is the basic fact that we're alive that we're getting to experience"
2863.500,2865.000," conscious existence"
2866.500,2868.100," and you know whatever"
2869.200,2873.500," is before that and after it whatever we we can only speculate on but"
2874.300,2878.100," and or maybe it's just nothing that the lights go out you know"
2878.700,2880.000," but right now"
2880.900,2884.100," that's not the case right now we're having conscious experience"
2884.700,2885.400," and if I"
2886.400,2886.700," just"
2887.100,2888.400," pay some kind of"
2889.300,2892.600," you know sort of homage really to that some kind of"
2893.400,2894.200," acknowledgement"
2894.900,2895.400," to that"
2896.200,2898.700," gift of all gifts I mean ultimate gifts really"
2902.200,2902.400," it's"
2903.200,2903.500," healthy"
2904.400,2905.400," just to do that"
2911.200,2911.200," so"
2911.600,2914.000," here's what I'm planning for now"
2915.000,2921.000," is the let's see what happens but I wanted to give a hoping to give a really short to talk"
2921.700,2923.600," and have more time for Q&A"
2924.500,2925.200," that's the plan"
2925.800,2927.700," and what I want to talk about is"
2929.400,2935.000," emerged from it's been sort of brewing over over recent weeks"
2935.700,2937.400," and I'm going to kick it off bye"
2938.200,2938.900," Reading"
2939.500,2940.000," art of"
2941.200,2945.500," I guess a message that I've you know one of these practices that I sometimes"
2946.700,2948.800," uh we sometimes put out and"
2949.500,2950.900," wish I'd been"
2952.000,2953.500," working on for a while and"
2955.600,2959.400," it's about a trip to the shops I've seen to"
2959.900,2961.000," have a very nice time"
2961.700,2965.000," making trips to shops these days because where we live in Santa Fe"
2965.800,2969.400," we can we can we can do most of our"
2970.400,2973.200," weekly round of errands on foot"
2974.200,2975.100," which is"
2976.700,2980.500," something that used to be quite a common experience to me when living back in the UK"
2981.300,2981.500," but"
2981.900,2984.000," what has been less so living in"
2984.900,2986.500," the American West where"
2987.100,2988.700," you tend to get in a car"
2989.500,2991.200," to do any kind of errand"
2991.800,2995.700," and it's so nice to be doing errands on Foot Again"
2996.500,2996.600," and"
2997.900,3001.800," I wish I wish more of us could have that experience and"
3002.500,3004.200," you know but really you have to live in"
3005.000,3008.100," generally have to live in an older city one that predates"
3009.000,3011.300," or at least some of parts of it predate the car"
3012.000,3013.300," where"
3013.900,3015.800," you know it's it's it's the old"
3016.400,3018.900," that you know a human way from"
3019.600,3020.400," you know so many"
3021.000,3025.300," millennia and and even millions of years we've got around on foot"
3026.100,3026.300," and"
3028.500,3034.900," so this one it's I'm just going to read the start of it another trip to the shops this time to see the s to buy supplements"
3036.200,3039.200," it was later afternoon on a sublime Winters day"
3040.000,3041.300," calm and clear"
3041.700,3043.300," and afternoon that felt"
3044.600,3047.900," as if the grime and grind and Hustle of the world"
3048.700,3049.600," her guard choir"
3050.000,3051.500," and what was left was"
3052.700,3053.400," the town"
3054.300,3055.900," draped in fresh snow"
3056.900,3057.700," and above it"
3059.000,3060.500," the body of the Mountains"
3061.400,3062.300," where the cold"
3062.700,3063.600," had preserved"
3064.500,3066.000," their coat of White"
3066.500,3066.900," fur"
3067.600,3069.200," from last night's storm"
3071.100,3075.200," seeing just at the hour now when the last of the sun"
3075.900,3077.700," across the plane"
3078.600,3080.000," and gave them a blush"
3080.900,3081.400," of Pink"
3083.000,3085.200," by the time I came out of CVS"
3086.000,3086.500," the pink"
3087.400,3089.200," on the mountains had deepened"
3090.000,3091.200," to burnt orange"
3093.600,3097.500," I see it is really remarkable what happens to"
3098.400,3100.000," the light in Santa Fe"
3100.700,3104.500," in the late afternoon this much celebrated but rightly the"
3105.500,3108.400," the hour or so before the sun goes down"
3109.300,3111.700," really any season of the year in Santa Fe"
3112.200,3115.000," it's just extraordinary and you do have these mountains"
3115.600,3117.100," hovering above the town where"
3117.900,3120.300," the light can play out in remarkable ways and"
3120.800,3120.900," and"
3122.200,3125.800," you know whether they're snowy or not and this case they were"
3126.400,3129.900," then the colour more into a pale violet"
3130.800,3132.700," as the Shadow of the Earth"
3133.300,3134.400," took away colour"
3135.100,3136.100," from the lower slopes"
3137.200,3139.100," as if the colours were draining down"
3139.900,3141.500," into the body of the Mountains"
3142.400,3143.200," nourishing it"
3143.900,3146.400," as if the mountains were drinking in the colour"
3147.000,3148.800," like a rich drink of supplements"
3149.400,3150.500," that we're keep them well"
3151.500,3152.600," under the pelts"
3153.200,3154.600," that the forest and snow"
3155.400,3156.200," had given to them"
3158.200,3158.500," okay"
3159.200,3159.600," um"
3160.900,3161.900," but all along"
3163.900,3164.900," seeing this beauty"
3165.400,3166.900," there was another note"
3167.400,3167.900," sound"
3169.000,3169.600," in me"
3170.400,3172.500," some kind of pain or sadness"
3173.500,3175.500," I had been half ignoring it"
3177.300,3180.100," but while lifting up my eye to the Hills"
3181.900,3182.400," finally"
3182.900,3184.500," I heard what it was"
3185.900,3186.500," a feeling"
3187.100,3187.800," about my"
3188.600,3189.500," grandparents"
3191.700,3193.100," the suffering and despair"
3193.700,3196.400," that drove them to leave their native lands"
3197.100,3198.500," in Poland and Ukraine"
3199.700,3203.100," under pressure of pogrom and persecution"
3204.200,3205.300," they fled to London"
3206.200,3207.400," with two young children"
3208.800,3210.100," where my own father"
3211.500,3215.200," was later born to them much later in Central London"
3215.900,3217.300," the last of many children"
3219.600,3225.900," and it really struck me actually with a bit of a jilt of surprised there was really just one step"
3227.100,3227.400," between"
3228.500,3229.200," their"
3229.500,3230.100," suffering"
3230.800,3231.100," in"
3232.600,3233.500," Eastern Europe"
3235.400,3235.600," and"
3237.300,3237.600," today"
3238.800,3240.800," there's just my dad because they"
3241.700,3243.200," they left when they were young"
3244.300,3245.200," he was born"
3248.200,3250.500," 25 or so years later"
3251.800,3253.900," the last of their kids they had"
3254.400,3255.300," seven who lived"
3256.100,3258.400," and and then me you know"
3258.900,3260.100," I mean my dad died"
3260.700,3262.400," 10 12 years ago now"
3262.900,3263.600," the"
3264.100,3267.300," at the age of 81 which then seemed like a rifle days but"
3267.800,3268.300," so many"
3268.900,3271.500," so many deer older friends these days are living"
3272.300,3274.500," a good 10 years more than that"
3275.500,3277.800," 81 no longer seems quite such a"
3278.200,3279.300," such a formidable age"
3280.100,3284.900," but anyway so there's just you know he because he was born late to them and he lived his long life"
3285.600,3288.500," and you know he had me not particularly young either so"
3289.100,3290.800," there's really just one step between"
3291.900,3293.000," my grandparents"
3293.400,3294.300," his mum and dad"
3295.500,3296.500," leaving"
3298.000,3299.300," Poland and Ukraine"
3299.800,3302.000," she was from the Ukraine he was proponent"
3303.000,3304.900," and going to London"
3305.900,3307.400," boom then they have"
3308.700,3309.300," my dad"
3309.700,3311.200," here I am living in"
3312.200,3313.100," western US"
3314.900,3315.000," and"
3315.900,3316.500," what really"
3317.200,3318.100," hit me was"
3320.200,3320.500," that"
3322.200,3322.300," you know"
3323.000,3324.200," how would"
3324.600,3325.600," they take"
3326.900,3327.200," what"
3328.300,3328.900," is going on"
3330.000,3330.800," in Gaza"
3332.100,3333.500," that their suffering"
3335.200,3338.500," which drove them to you know take them momentous step"
3339.600,3341.400," of leaving their homeland"
3342.700,3343.700," with their with the"
3344.800,3346.900," with the Beginnings of their family"
3350.500,3351.300," the that"
3352.500,3354.700," misery and oppression and persecution"
3356.600,3357.600," should now be"
3358.200,3358.800," going on"
3360.000,3363.000," in just as horrific away"
3364.100,3365.000," in Israel"
3365.900,3368.400," you know and some number of the family went to Israel"
3369.600,3369.900," actually"
3370.900,3371.200," and"
3371.700,3372.700," some number"
3373.300,3374.200," went to London"
3375.300,3377.100," and a much larger number"
3378.200,3379.200," did neither"
3380.800,3381.100," and"
3383.000,3388.700," this has you know in the already know what I mean by that you know they stayed where they were"
3389.600,3392.400," and actually one of the first death camps"
3393.700,3397.300," that was created in I think late 1941"
3398.100,3398.700," so I'll be bought"
3399.700,3401.800," in Poland was where"
3402.700,3404.300," you know some number"
3405.200,3407.300," of close relatives died"
3408.100,3409.800," and we we know"
3410.900,3413.800," of 42 who lived in the particular Village"
3414.800,3418.600," who were there in a census in something like 1940"
3419.000,3420.100," and of course not there"
3420.900,3423.600," in a sense of the mid or late forties"
3424.600,3427.000," because it all died in the camp"
3429.200,3429.400," and"
3430.700,3432.100," you know so so how"
3435.000,3435.300," so"
3436.500,3438.300," sorry I've just losing my track"
3440.000,3440.500," so there's"
3441.400,3443.300," so really the question was"
3444.300,3448.500," in that was that was that was sounding in me was"
3450.100,3450.500," what"
3451.400,3453.500," what's the connection or what's the"
3456.200,3459.600," you know the suffering that my own grandparents had"
3461.500,3462.900," back in their homeland"
3463.800,3467.000," of being you know brutally persecuted"
3468.000,3468.200," and"
3471.500,3471.800," then"
3473.400,3474.300," 100 years ago"
3476.000,3476.500," and then"
3477.800,3478.100," today"
3479.700,3480.500," Merciless"
3480.900,3481.300," persecution"
3482.000,3482.600," brutality"
3482.900,3483.400," going on"
3484.200,3486.100," buying an occupying Force"
3486.900,3489.500," very comparable and imperial Force"
3490.400,3491.600," you know totally"
3492.300,3494.000," buttressed and empowered by"
3495.000,3496.700," the US and by the UK"
3497.900,3498.000," you know"
3499.400,3501.000," all these decades you know"
3501.900,3504.100," creating such Misery for so long"
3504.800,3506.400," 70 years and counting you know"
3509.700,3511.400," what's the connection and what would"
3512.200,3514.100," what would they feel"
3514.600,3516.000," to see what has become"
3516.600,3517.500," of their suffering"
3518.600,3519.300," you know what"
3520.000,3520.700," is is it"
3521.900,3523.900," you know that that they left"
3525.100,3526.900," and you know what and and and and and and and and"
3527.700,3531.900," and and and and and how their their hopes that piece for safety for well-being"
3532.600,3534.500," which you know and many ways who are answered"
3535.600,3536.100," for them"
3537.100,3539.900," but the same thing that drove them from their"
3540.500,3541.600," drove others to Israel"
3542.300,3543.600," and has turned to"
3545.800,3546.900," multi-generational"
3547.300,3548.000," suffering"
3548.400,3548.800," there"
3549.500,3549.800," too"
3550.800,3550.900," and"
3552.100,3553.900," I don't believe that they would"
3555.300,3557.300," they would for a minute want that"
3557.700,3558.500," to have been done"
3559.300,3560.200," in their name"
3561.100,3562.000," if you see it in it"
3563.100,3565.300," I don't think for a minute that they would consider"
3566.200,3566.800," that that was"
3567.700,3568.200," the rite"
3569.600,3570.900," result"
3572.600,3573.800," their own escape"
3574.100,3574.300," from"
3574.900,3575.500," persecution"
3578.800,3579.400," I've been"
3580.000,3582.300," you know like many of us I mean very sort of"
3583.500,3584.600," in a troubled by"
3585.600,3585.900," bye"
3586.600,3589.900," the behaviour of the this particular Israeli"
3591.400,3593.800," government you know for so many decades now"
3594.400,3596.700," being empower or ones like it"
3597.400,3597.600," and"
3599.700,3600.800," it's it's"
3601.200,3601.500," it's it's"
3602.400,3606.300," it's it's it's it's particularly difficult to actually being in America where as much more"
3606.900,3607.500," propaganda"
3608.200,3610.200," about Israel and as much harder for"
3610.800,3615.200," anybody really to understand what's really going on there is being extraordinary"
3616.000,3618.200," to becoming here as a European Jew"
3619.300,3620.000," half Jew"
3621.000,3624.000," to see how you know all these years I've lived here seeing how"
3624.900,3625.000," how"
3626.200,3629.600," the difference in the way things are reported is just extraordinary I mean"
3630.600,3631.200," you'll see"
3632.000,3633.900," you know the BBC will report"
3635.200,3638.000," British Israeli commandos attacking a"
3638.600,3642.300," ship trying to bring food into into Gaza"
3642.900,3645.500," I remember seeing this some 10 or 15 years ago"
3646.500,3649.100," you know this really commander helicopter you know"
3649.800,3651.000," povert over the ship and"
3652.000,3655.700," you know half a dozen or a dozen come on those dropped onto the"
3656.200,3658.500," vessel and started attacking the crew"
3659.300,3661.600," and it was reported on CNN as"
3662.300,3664.200," a even on CNN you know as"
3664.800,3665.600," there have been"
3666.400,3667.500," a some kind of"
3669.000,3674.100," Combat between a crew of a ship and some Israeli soldiers"
3675.200,3678.700," it wasn't simply stated that you know they're attacked this ship"
3679.900,3683.800," and I think how what what are the forces at work that"
3684.800,3688.000," that weren't just present this stuff straightforwardly"
3689.000,3690.000," and it's actually"
3691.700,3695.800," you know and and so much vested and really in this country and not"
3699.300,3703.400," not letting the the fairly plain facts of the matter"
3704.200,3705.500," be stated but then"
3706.300,3710.500," actually you know it's it's very easy to I've held that view like well"
3711.300,3714.200," damn you know it's an apartment regime all these"
3715.000,3715.800," 70 years and"
3716.300,3717.300," surely that's obvious"
3718.200,3718.400," and"
3721.100,3726.100," personally I mean I I don't I don't think that's wrong now I think I still think that's"
3726.800,3727.300," basically"
3728.800,3731.300," a way of looking at it that probably has"
3732.100,3733.700," you know it's pretty sound and"
3735.000,3737.400," you know you can find tons of if you listen to"
3738.000,3741.500," gamble matte who speaks about it very closely and you listen to"
3742.200,3744.000," there's a lot of there's a lot of material on it"
3745.000,3747.000," that you can find and just read a"
3747.600,3749.900," an lrb any any any any any"
3751.100,3753.500," any sort of reliable"
3754.400,3755.900," you know reasonably"
3756.500,3757.300," impartial"
3757.900,3758.100," sort of"
3760.900,3762.100," you know coverage will"
3763.900,3765.100," you can find out"
3766.400,3769.000," the history of it fairly fairly easily but"
3771.300,3772.200," the difficulty"
3773.200,3776.300," is the is how entangle it gets"
3777.200,3777.400," and"
3778.900,3781.900," you know I mean speaking personally you know I can see"
3782.900,3783.800," on one level"
3784.900,3788.600," it's it's another Legacy of colonial imperialism"
3790.600,3792.500," my own British ancestors"
3793.400,3794.600," involved in that actually"
3795.400,3796.100," in different ways"
3797.300,3797.800," um"
3798.500,3801.300," and on another Level you know it's"
3802.300,3805.500," there's this absolutely desperate Jewish history that"
3806.300,3808.400," that so needed"
3809.600,3810.400," a home land"
3811.500,3811.600," and"
3813.300,3814.300," it's it's just"
3815.200,3816.400," so easy to"
3817.300,3818.600," think it's simple"
3820.400,3820.600," when"
3821.800,3822.200," it isn't"
3826.500,3830.600," and how do we how do we what do we how do we be with it all well"
3834.900,3838.700," one thing as a two things I want to draw out here actually"
3840.000,3840.700," in the because I'm trying"
3841.600,3843.400," it's sounded like I'm I'm being rather"
3844.300,3848.700," dogmatic about it perhaps or over simplicity about it but I don't I don't want to be"
3849.500,3851.400," I don't mean to be uncomfort that's not really"
3852.300,3856.000," where I'm at with it actually but here's the couple of points"
3857.100,3858.700," the first is that I'm"
3861.700,3861.900," there's"
3864.800,3865.600," there's a human"
3867.100,3868.200," evolutionary"
3869.600,3870.700,"a capacity"
3872.100,3874.400," can relatively easily get activated"
3875.100,3876.500," to dehumanize"
3877.200,3877.800," other humans"
3878.800,3879.500," and it's not"
3880.100,3880.700," cultural"
3881.800,3883.800," it's not about education"
3884.500,3885.600," it's not about"
3888.300,3891.000," yeah bubble is not about culture because sometimes"
3891.600,3895.100," you know people have thought that these terrible things humans do to one another"
3895.800,3900.100," you know let's say we'll look at the culture that was doing it it had all these"
3900.600,3903.400," problems it was authoritarian and it was this and it was that"
3904.500,3908.600," but actually that just doesn't the contemporary research"
3909.400,3911.200," on it just doesn't hold hold up"
3912.100,3914.800," that view it is actually a human"
3915.400,3917.100," either loosen tendency"
3917.800,3918.500," to get into"
3919.300,3920.200," pretty intense"
3921.100,3923.200," you know tribal or group"
3924.000,3925.600," Dynamics of"
3927.000,3927.600," opposition"
3928.300,3929.000," and and the"
3929.400,3930.500," and the and the most"
3931.200,3932.400," sort of the most"
3933.200,3935.000," Extreme form of that which happens"
3935.800,3938.200," much more often than we we would think"
3938.600,3940.300," is the dehumanising"
3940.600,3941.400," to be"
3942.600,3944.200," not according"
3944.800,3946.600," to sort of the status of human"
3947.000,3948.300," to people outside the group"
3949.100,3952.800," and that I'm speaking a lot from this book"
3953.100,3954.200," the survival of the friendliest"
3955.100,3956.800," which I think"
3957.900,3960.900," had really recommend everybody take a look at"
3962.800,3964.200," with survival of the friend list"
3966.400,3967.100," and"
3971.700,3971.900," we"
3972.900,3973.900," as practitioners"
3975.700,3976.700," you know we can"
3977.600,3978.000," become"
3979.300,3981.300," we have a we have less hope"
3982.000,3983.200," easier time"
3984.300,3985.400," becoming aware of that"
3986.000,3987.800," so I'm just going to read that about what I said"
3988.500,3994.000," along with our species exceptional capacity for Cooperative communication for collaborative action"
3994.900,3999.100," we also have the capacity to dehumanize other human groups"
4000.200,4003.500," wherever there's been cruelty in oppression dehumanising"
4004.300,4005.600," typically accompanies it"
4006.600,4008.700," and in a vicious spiral actually"
4009.300,4012.500," nothing insights one group to teach humanize another"
4013.100,4014.800," like feeling that the other group"
4015.300,4017.400," is already dehumanizing it"
4019.900,4026.800," and you know we know that populist politicians will will play into that they'll use that"
4027.600,4028.800," as a way of manufacturing"
4030.000,4032.000," tribes and tribal"
4033.700,4037.200," what sort of moc tribes and inciting their their anger"
4038.300,4040.600," but so just a call out"
4041.900,4042.400," are"
4043.200,4045.200," capacity for dehumanizing"
4046.500,4049.200," you know which is part of our evolutionary equipment"
4050.600,4052.300," is a first step"
4052.800,4053.600," recognising"
4054.600,4054.800," that"
4055.700,4056.500," it's a human"
4057.000,4057.200," problem"
4058.100,4059.300," not a culture what"
4060.500,4063.800," you know our evolutionary history up to this point"
4064.900,4069.800," has wired us to be able to dehumanize others relatively easily"
4071.100,4072.900," and which naturally we don't like to admit"
4073.900,4074.600," and it takes"
4075.200,4077.200," recognising it and accepting it"
4078.300,4081.100," and being prepared to get educated about it"
4081.800,4083.300," doing some work on it"
4084.200,4085.400," to diminish it's impact"
4086.600,4086.800," and"
4088.100,4088.500," I think"
4090.400,4091.600," I think we could"
4092.800,4094.200," say that practice"
4095.500,4097.000," will help with that"
4097.400,4098.300," process because"
4099.300,4101.100," it's easier to get"
4102.000,4104.800," less attached to our identities"
4105.600,4106.400," through practice"
4107.000,4108.200," it can soften"
4108.700,4109.000," our"
4109.800,4110.700," attachment to"
4112.100,4114.200," all manner of identification"
4115.000,4115.800," I mean in the end"
4117.000,4118.200," practice can actually"
4119.100,4120.700," defuse"
4121.600,4123.200," identifying altogether"
4124.100,4128.100," it can I mean we may not think that that's a terribly good thing"
4128.600,4130.800," but at least we can see that"
4131.400,4133.700," the process of identification is a"
4137.300,4140.500," is just a construction it's just a process"
4141.600,4143.800," and we can see that it's possible"
4144.800,4146.300," to hold it"
4147.500,4149.200," in a in an"
4149.500,4150.800," unidentified or"
4151.400,4152.100," a wide open"
4152.700,4153.700," way to"
4154.100,4155.600," see identification"
4156.700,4157.400," in action"
4158.100,4160.400," and not be caught up in it"
4163.600,4165.000," but there's a but there's another"
4165.900,4169.300," another lens actually as well which is a"
4172.600,4174.700," which is a really old fashioned one"
4175.600,4179.600," and and I I don't know that it's very defensible but I want to"
4180.400,4181.300," share it anyway"
4182.400,4182.700," um"
4183.200,4183.400," it's"
4183.900,4184.100," it's"
4186.900,4189.900," I'm almost a little embarrassed to offer it actually"
4190.600,4192.400," because it seems so ridiculous but"
4194.300,4195.600," you know there was a time"
4196.000,4196.300," when"
4199.900,4202.000," the view that beauty"
4203.600,4205.300," appreciation for beauty"
4206.000,4207.300," could help humans"
4209.000,4209.300," Waze"
4210.100,4213.900," powerfully popular among intellectuals in Europe"
4214.600,4218.900," basically you know the late 17th early 19th century the romantic"
4219.300,4219.700," period"
4220.700,4221.600," was"
4222.700,4224.100," a time when"
4225.100,4226.100," you um"
4226.500,4230.200," well there was a german poet and playwright Schiller you may"
4230.800,4232.200," you may have heard of who was"
4232.900,4235.900," particular advocate of a sort of aesthetic"
4236.100,4236.600," Theory"
4237.400,4239.400," that it appreciating"
4240.100,4240.800," beauty"
4241.500,4242.000," Waze"
4243.100,4244.300," a shield"
4245.200,4245.800," against"
4248.200,4249.500," immorality"
4250.000,4252.300," and brutality he actually"
4252.800,4254.800," and this would became a very popular view"
4256.200,4256.300," and"
4257.600,4260.600," you can see I mean the logic in it I think is is"
4261.200,4263.800," there is there is there is something to it you know"
4264.600,4269.000," the idea and you look at words worth it was greatly influenced by that you know he"
4270.200,4270.800," was worth"
4271.400,4272.600," believed in"
4273.600,4275.100," the experience of beauty"
4276.000,4276.800," as a kind of"
4277.500,4279.500," edifying or educational"
4282.300,4285.100," element in a life that it actually was"
4286.000,4286.600," it was the"
4287.300,4288.800," discovery of beauty"
4289.300,4290.600," where you could find it that"
4291.300,4292.200," help to grow"
4293.300,4294.400," what he called the soul"
4295.200,4296.100," the the"
4297.100,4299.300," something in US that's innocent"
4300.000,4301.600," and and and and and and good"
4302.300,4304.400," that's a sort of core of who we are"
4305.000,4307.300," is nourished by beauty"
4308.200,4308.400," and"
4309.000,4310.400," and in the course of"
4310.900,4312.700," being so nourished"
4313.400,4315.800," it may come to moments"
4316.900,4318.800," of recognising that it's"
4319.300,4320.400," it's part of"
4322.000,4324.600," guess what in a great oneness that"
4325.900,4332.100," that there's a he used to talking I mean not used to now and then he described incredibly powerful beautifully"
4332.700,4334.300," experiencing a sense that"
4334.900,4337.500," the whole world was one mind"
4339.000,4340.800," was a single consciousness"
4341.800,4343.900," you know that was forming itself into"
4344.800,4348.100," Great hills and things like that I mean there's a marvelous description and"
4348.900,4349.200," in this"
4349.700,4352.800," thing that very few people read these days the prelude Is Massive"
4353.200,4353.800," long work"
4354.400,4356.100," when his hiking as a young man"
4357.000,4361.900," in North Wales and Snowdonia there's a the biggest mountain in Wales is called Snowden"
4362.900,4364.000," and I just"
4364.500,4366.700," temporarily forgotten as well as name I'm sorry"
4367.300,4367.700," um"
4370.800,4374.900," and you know he's he's a he's out he's up there on a moonlit night"
4375.700,4375.900," and"
4377.900,4378.600," and there's a great"
4379.200,4382.400," he gets above the cloud so this great sea of"
4382.800,4385.600," white mist below him like like an ocean"
4386.500,4386.700," and then"
4387.600,4388.400," they get to the top"
4388.900,4390.200," and as they're coming down the"
4390.800,4393.100," the Miss starts to part and he sees these"
4393.800,4396.900," deep deep valleys and the great ridges of Hill"
4397.300,4398.000," between them"
4398.800,4401.800," in the Moonlight you know incredibly beautifully described you know"
4402.500,4404.200," and he just he just has this sort of"
4405.200,4408.900," I don't know what you call it a flash of intuition or a flash of insight or"
4409.600,4410.400," and Awakening"
4410.800,4411.000," that"
4412.200,4412.700," they are"
4414.000,4414.500," the very"
4415.200,4417.300," presence of a single mind"
4419.000,4420.200," that he too is"
4422.300,4423.400," a manifestation of"
4423.700,4423.700," so"
4424.500,4426.900," a deep sense of one Ness"
4428.000,4428.100," that"
4428.600,4429.300," the kind of"
4430.400,4434.600," comes to his attention is comes into his experience"
4435.600,4435.800," through"
4437.000,4437.500," beauty"
4439.000,4439.300," you know"
4439.600,4440.200," um"
4441.200,4445.300," and to see Beauty I mean this is and this is incredibly unpopular"
4445.800,4446.200," I'm sure"
4446.800,4447.400," point of view and I"
4447.900,4448.800," I don't really want to"
4449.300,4450.600," get to attach to it but"
4451.300,4457.100," but seeing beauty has a value and let me just I'm going to just come back to what I was writing"
4460.700,4460.900," so"
4462.000,4471.700," so yeah there's the frame of the humanization one way of just understanding that and that I too have that capacity to dehumanize so I'm not"
4472.400,4473.500," going to dehumanize"
4474.200,4476.900," the dehumanizes by saying they're dehumanizes"
4477.700,4478.300," but I am not"
4479.100,4481.700," know it's a part of our human wiring"
4482.200,4483.100," to be able to do this"
4483.800,4484.400," and I"
4484.900,4487.100," last must own it to"
4488.300,4489.500," you know and it seems to me"
4490.300,4490.600," that's"
4491.200,4493.800," one way of kind of interrupting the cycle of"
4494.700,4495.600," dehumanization"
4497.000,4497.800," understanding that"
4498.700,4502.000," everybody involved in this terrible tangle of suffering"
4502.700,4503.000," you know"
4503.500,4504.700," my Jewish Forbes"
4505.100,4505.600," me"
4506.200,4507.900," my British Forbes"
4508.700,4512.100," you know I didn't I didn't really know how involved I mean"
4512.400,4514.500," you know again as I said I know"
4515.100,4516.200," a couple of them anyway we're"
4516.700,4518.100," colonial administrators"
4518.900,4522.500," you know and it's all it's a such a tangle the whole thing so"
4523.000,4523.700," to forget"
4524.200,4525.100," taking signs"
4525.500,4526.500," they're doing wrong"
4527.200,4528.600," we're right they're wrong"
4529.100,4529.800," forget that"
4530.400,4531.900," instead let"
4532.600,4533.600," the acknowledgement"
4534.400,4537.300," that we have this evolutionary the"
4538.200,4539.900," developed wiring"
4540.800,4541.500," to say"
4541.800,4543.200," you know us and then"
4544.000,4544.100," and"
4544.600,4545.000," us"
4545.300,4545.600," good"
4546.000,4547.100," them bad"
4548.500,4549.100," you know and"
4549.800,4549.900," to"
4551.400,4552.400," I've got it too"
4553.200,4554.700," therefore I practice"
4555.500,4557.100," therefore I acknowledge"
4557.600,4558.200," the need"
4558.500,4559.300," to train"
4560.300,4561.500," my heart and my mind"
4562.300,4563.400," I don't assume"
4564.200,4565.100," that there are given"
4566.100,4567.800," that they're just automatically good"
4568.700,4571.400," what I think when I feel boom let me just act it out"
4572.100,4572.500," no"
4573.200,4573.700," I say"
4574.500,4575.500," I'm going to practice"
4576.600,4576.900," I'm going to"
4577.500,4580.000," I'm going to find Wisdom where I can"
4580.900,4582.600," and follow what it"
4583.100,4583.700," suggests"
4584.300,4584.900," wisdom"
4586.600,4587.100," meaning"
4588.200,4588.500," not"
4588.900,4591.300," doctrine not Creed not Dogma"
4592.100,4592.200," but"
4592.800,4594.900," understanding of Human Nature"
4595.700,4596.000," that"
4596.500,4598.200," understands it's capacity"
4599.000,4599.300," for"
4599.600,4600.100," harm"
4600.900,4603.200," and it's capacity for"
4604.200,4605.800," developing into"
4606.700,4607.500," harmlessness"
4608.300,4608.900," or at least"
4609.300,4610.600," reducing harm"
4611.500,4614.600," and and I'm going to I'm going to go with that I'm going to"
4615.400,4616.300," let myself"
4617.100,4617.300," you know"
4618.600,4622.800," trained in ways that have been shown to be effective"
4623.500,4626.300," and that are not about adopting more Dogma"
4626.600,4628.300," more belief more faith in"
4628.800,4629.800," blind creed's"
4630.500,4631.000," they're about"
4631.700,4633.600," actually understanding the human"
4636.200,4640.700," neuro psychological biological equipment"
4642.000,4642.300," and"
4643.000,4643.700," and actually"
4644.700,4646.700," yes sort of training it"
4647.400,4647.700," so"
4648.200,4650.200," there's a particular kind of training"
4651.500,4657.100," because it's very paradoxical it's not the kind of training where you force it to do certain things"
4657.800,4659.900," you know like going to the gym and"
4660.200,4661.900," building strength through resistance and"
4662.600,4664.700," repetition and whatever all the"
4665.500,4666.100," the ways that"
4666.500,4668.800," we can build that kind of physical strength"
4669.300,4670.300," this is different"
4671.100,4672.200," it's much more"
4672.600,4675.600," about the opposite for that actually it's much more"
4676.300,4677.300," about releasing"
4678.000,4679.700," it's more about allowing"
4680.100,4682.300," in the sense of giving space for"
4684.000,4688.500," not sort of allowing just I have an impulse I act it that's not what we mean by allowing"
4689.200,4692.100," it's allowing us to allow the Impulse"
4692.600,4694.500," to be with the impulse to get to"
4695.200,4698.200," understand and experience and read and know"
4698.800,4701.400," the impulse to understand to understand and"
4701.900,4702.500," and read"
4702.900,4705.500," detect read and understand no"
4706.200,4706.500," our"
4707.300,4707.900," reactivity"
4708.900,4708.900," to"
4709.500,4711.000," have this space"
4711.600,4712.600," to hold it"
4713.900,4714.900," that's how it's"
4715.700,4716.400," undone"
4717.200,4718.800," the simply given space"
4720.600,4721.400," to be known"
4722.200,4724.100," is how it can"
4724.200,4725.200," be undone"
4726.000,4729.100," so it's a different kind of training from others we might think of"
4729.400,4730.500," but man it's"
4731.600,4732.300," worth"
4733.500,4733.600," it but"
4734.400,4734.800," also"
4736.800,4737.100," then"
4737.600,4738.900," let's also see"
4739.800,4740.000," you know"
4740.900,4741.600," what about"
4743.000,4744.400," coming back to that walk"
4744.700,4748.600," to CBS to buy supplements the beautiful beautiful mountains"
4749.400,4752.000," then going on off on this this whole thing around"
4753.100,4755.400," the tragedies of human suffering"
4756.400,4758.900," passed on passed around needed out"
4759.300,4761.100," this way that way so on"
4761.600,4764.600," and the role of dehumanization and making all that happen"
4765.300,4766.600," but at the same time"
4767.500,4768.300," coming out of"
4769.100,4769.800," CVS"
4770.600,4771.500," and seeing"
4772.200,4773.500," these mountain"
4774.800,4777.800," which are part of my experience"
4778.300,4780.600," that part of this world we're living in"
4781.400,4782.300," very very"
4783.100,4783.600," beautiful"
4784.700,4785.300," why"
4786.000,4786.500," how"
4787.100,4787.600," who knows"
4788.100,4788.700," here they are"
4789.700,4790.600," their magnificent"
4791.600,4793.000," just in and of themselves"
4793.500,4796.100," and it almost feels like there's a teaching"
4796.500,4797.200," being given"
4797.700,4798.200," by them"
4798.500,4799.100," somehow"
4799.800,4801.500," because of their great beauty"
4802.100,4803.300," or because of what"
4803.500,4804.800," because of that presence"
4805.400,4806.400," because of their"
4808.600,4809.100," peace"
4809.400,4810.300," because of their"
4811.500,4813.300," solidity because of their"
4814.000,4814.500," well"
4815.200,4816.300," play of colour"
4816.700,4817.300," I don't know"
4817.800,4818.800," but there they are"
4819.600,4820.400," am I just gonna"
4822.200,4822.500," ignore"
4823.200,4823.900," come back to"
4824.400,4826.000," trying to figure out this human tangle"
4826.600,4827.600," but they're there as well"
4828.300,4830.700," so the second lens for being with it all"
4831.200,4834.200," at the same time isn't there a necessity to meet"
4834.900,4835.400," and feel"
4836.200,4839.700," and know the beauty of these mountains as the sun is saying"
4840.300,4841.200," farewell to them"
4841.600,4842.300," as they meet"
4842.800,4845.200," and receive the fading light of the sun"
4845.900,4847.500," isn't that somehow important"
4848.300,4848.700," as well"
4849.500,4851.400," in this brief time we walk the earth"
4853.400,4853.500," so"
4854.200,4854.500," what"
4855.200,4856.000," what do we do"
4856.900,4857.100," well"
4860.200,4862.400," you know we help where we can at least"
4863.100,4864.600," that seems to be fairly"
4865.900,4866.900," self-explanatory"
4869.000,4874.100," but can we also know the beauty that being alive is in and of itself"
4874.900,4877.900," even in our sorrow and our despair and our anguish"
4879.800,4881.100," the way governments behave"
4881.800,4882.900," the way we"
4883.500,4886.700," as a species create such massive harm for us ourselves"
4888.200,4889.700," the way harm"
4890.600,4893.000," itself violence itself"
4895.700,4897.100," is still not sort of"
4898.000,4899.600," acknowledged as a no-go"
4900.700,4903.500," it's just we just whatever we do we don't go there"
4904.100,4906.700," we don't blow children to pieces"
4907.400,4908.700," which just don't do that"
4909.700,4909.800," but"
4910.400,4911.200," we do still"
4912.000,4912.100," you know"
4912.800,4913.500," can't we"
4914.300,4915.800," just get that agreed"
4916.300,4916.600," no"
4917.400,4919.300," and what do we feel about that well"
4919.800,4921.000," often I feel anguish"
4922.000,4922.100," you know"
4923.300,4923.600," and"
4924.800,4925.300," but"
4926.000,4926.800," nevertheless"
4928.600,4929.600," the mountains are beautiful"
4936.600,4938.100," and all of it"
4939.400,4941.800,"is processed by the the shin"
4942.400,4943.600," the human heart mind"
4944.200,4945.700," the shin in Chinese"
4946.300,4947.100," the heartland"
4947.500,4949.100," is processing all of"
4952.400,4954.000," that how to keep it open"
4956.100,4957.100," how to keep it not"
4957.400,4958.100," getting stuck"
4959.400,4959.800," fixed"
4960.700,4961.600," thinking it knows"
4962.200,4963.700," so easy for it to close"
4964.500,4967.100," onto Solutions onto understanding is that it"
4968.400,4969.300," feelz must be alright"
4971.100,4974.700," and and I'm about to start but just the last thing"
4977.100,4977.400," god"
4978.400,4979.100," damn I I"
4980.100,4982.300," I most amazing thing happened to me recently"
4982.900,4984.900," in this whole terrain which was that"
4985.800,4987.100," it costs"
4987.500,4989.900," I certainly got a box in the mail"
4990.700,4990.900," and"
4993.800,4998.400," it was it was the most ingenious gift it was a it was a gift sent from Poland"
4999.100,5000.900," and it had four things in it"
5001.900,5003.100," the fourth however"
5003.900,5007.000," it would have had for but the fourth one couldn't be sent"
5007.900,5010.100," because it was a bottle of vodka"
5010.500,5012.900," that had a single blade of grass in"
5013.200,5014.900," it which was an acknowledgement of my book"
5015.300,5016.800," one blade of grass by"
5017.300,5021.500," a kind original love participant Xenon"
5022.200,5024.000," who's translating the book actually at the moment"
5024.800,5025.900," in Poland"
5026.500,5027.900," but he had it had"
5028.500,5030.500," it had a couple of other things that it has four"
5031.000,5033.900," it should have had that and it had three other things that it did have"
5034.600,5035.900," one of which was a little"
5036.900,5039.000," golden bag about the size of"
5039.700,5040.400," a matchbox"
5041.500,5042.700," with something heavy in it"
5044.400,5044.600," and"
5045.800,5046.100," actually"
5047.700,5048.700," another of the things"
5049.200,5051.100," was a set of three photographs"
5052.500,5052.800," of"
5053.900,5054.400," the camp"
5054.800,5055.700," so be bored"
5056.800,5058.400," and one of those photographs"
5060.200,5060.400," most"
5062.300,5066.200," was really extraordinarily beautiful this field"
5067.500,5069.500," a great great wide field"
5070.700,5072.100," a little pieces of White"
5072.500,5073.000," marble"
5074.500,5077.500," that had just completely carpeted this great area"
5079.500,5079.800," just"
5081.600,5082.400," you know rubble"
5083.300,5084.800," but the Rubble was white Marr"
5087.300,5090.300," dealing this a lot of just a large large large field"
5091.400,5095.500," of White Mark Stones pebbles little pieces of white marble"
5096.600,5097.500," nothing but that"
5099.300,5099.500," and"
5102.000,5102.500," ah"
5102.700,5104.500," there's this little little little bag"
5104.900,5105.500," in my gift"
5107.100,5108.200," with a heavy thing in it"
5110.100,5110.200," and"
5112.300,5112.800," I've been sort of"
5113.500,5114.100," enjoying the"
5115.000,5117.900," little cards and things as well and that's enjoying"
5118.700,5120.400," kind of unpacking it all and"
5121.700,5123.200," and then I got to this little bag"
5124.300,5125.300," and actually"
5127.300,5129.500," it was very strange I- held it"
5130.400,5131.900," and I just burst into tears"
5136.400,5137.400," actually before"
5138.100,5139.000," I knew I was in it"
5141.000,5141.200," and"
5143.100,5145.000," I am tired it's a little sort of lace"
5146.300,5147.300," just touched it"
5148.200,5150.700," what was inside I didn't dare take it out"
5151.500,5152.700," and I I but I"
5153.600,5156.000," like it was as if I knew what it was before I"
5156.300,5157.400," cognitively knew"
5158.600,5161.400," but it was indeed a little piece of white marble"
5164.500,5164.700," and"
5166.100,5167.500," with an extraordinary gift"
5168.600,5172.800," and maybe another I've got a little poem I wrote about it but not now"
5174.800,5174.900," so"
5177.000,5178.700," that's the end of that little story"
5179.200,5180.900," and that little um"
5181.300,5182.400," exploration and I"
5183.300,5184.800," I am I I think we should"
5185.600,5187.100," just have a moment of quiet"
5187.900,5189.600," I'll have a look at the chat"
5191.100,5193.400," and we'll we'll go to questions"
5195.400,5196.000," that we all"
5197.100,5199.600," as we all wrestle with these difficult things you know"
5314.300,5314.900," well"
5328.800,5328.900," you know"
5334.500,5334.700," yeah"
5335.200,5335.400," you know"
5336.700,5339.800," yeah yeah I'm just I'm just reading some of the great comments in the"
5340.300,5341.000," in the chat"
5342.800,5343.000," yeah"
5343.500,5345.500," it's I mean I think I don't know whether"
5348.600,5353.700," there's a lot of concern about how do we what you know what how do we sort of how do we approach it"
5355.000,5356.200," and I'm trying to"
5357.700,5360.500," America what do I know you know"
5361.100,5364.600," I'm just going to speak from my own practice that I think there's a"
5366.400,5369.100," there's a there is it does seem to me that"
5372.800,5378.800," you know it was cooled out quite well in traditional Buddhism which says there are three poison"
5379.900,5380.400," and they are"
5381.200,5381.700," breed"
5382.700,5383.400," and Hate"
5384.100,5384.300," and"
5385.000,5389.200," misunderstanding or sometimes called Delusion or confusion or"
5391.300,5391.500," yeah"
5392.600,5397.100," misunderstanding really I think is the best or is the most"
5397.700,5400.800," least sort of the pejorative where putting it"
5402.000,5402.300," and I think"
5403.100,5405.400," I think it's it's recognising"
5406.000,5406.600," that early"
5407.000,5408.000," Buddhist position"
5409.400,5409.600," that"
5410.800,5413.300," we've got over even loosening wiring"
5413.600,5414.300," but we've inherited"
5415.200,5416.000," and it's not"
5416.700,5417.500," impossible"
5418.200,5420.700," it's not easy but it's not impossible"
5422.100,5422.200," to"
5423.400,5424.200," correct it"
5424.600,5426.900," or work on correcting it somebody says yeah"
5427.400,5429.300," there was a I like that comment"
5430.500,5435.700," you know we're a failed experiment or how did that has it there was it was quite there was quite a humerus"
5436.700,5440.200," yeah I think of it as a design floor this is Laurie"
5440.900,5444.700," the design for on a human DNA often that we're a failed experiment"
5445.700,5449.200," and and then so we're all failing together and last"
5450.400,5451.700," well I think that's a much"
5452.700,5455.300," sort of wiser and safer position to be"
5456.400,5457.800," at than thinking we're right"
5459.300,5460.600," you know which is Which is"
5461.300,5463.900," which is Which is what we might often"
5465.100,5468.500," we might often think we're all drowning in the three poisons I think so"
5469.100,5471.400," I mean thanks for the appreciation in here by the way"
5472.200,5473.000," of people"
5473.600,5477.500," I mean it's a terribly difficult thing to talk about because as somebody said"
5478.300,5479.700," even if you if you come"
5480.400,5482.100," from a sort of neutral position"
5483.100,5484.300," that's deeply"
5485.200,5485.800," hurtful"
5486.600,5491.400," to the vulnerable how do we do this without being clinical neutral which also hurts the vulnerable"
5491.800,5493.500," who suffer with the status quo"
5494.100,5499.500," because in this case for example there's a clear side that is morally monstrous bombing hospitals engineering famine"
5499.800,5500.400," etc"
5501.200,5502.300," well I mean I agree"
5503.100,5506.200," but we must also still recognise"
5506.900,5509.600," that we all suffer from"
5510.800,5514.200," the same liabilities you know and"
5515.600,5519.600," God and and and and and somehow make the distinction between governments and people"
5520.600,5521.500," you know that that"
5524.200,5527.700," you know what I mean there's so easy to to our god is them"
5528.300,5529.800," then without nationality"
5530.500,5531.400," of course it's not"
5532.300,5536.600," all nationalities are at the mercy of these ghastly governments that we all seem to get"
5537.200,5537.300," you know"
5538.000,5538.100," and"
5540.500,5546.500," I mean just and I agree with this so yeah whoever said it's been rinse and repeat throughout human history I think so too"
5547.300,5548.200," and I think again"
5548.800,5552.300," that that's a value of this practice I don't want to be"
5553.000,5554.600," drugly Buddhist or kind of"
5555.200,5556.700," side with Buddhism against other"
5557.300,5557.700," forms of"
5558.300,5558.800," spirituality"
5559.200,5560.000," of course not but"
5561.300,5562.600," but I think any"
5563.200,5565.700," I remember once hearing somebody say that you know what was"
5566.500,5567.700," particularly good about"
5569.000,5570.600," indigenous wisdom"
5571.600,5574.200," is that it always seemed to recognise"
5575.300,5577.000," that damage limitation"
5577.500,5580.600," was more important than anything else with humans"
5581.300,5583.200," then it's sort of came from this place that"
5583.600,5584.700," we're Wayne words"
5585.000,5587.300," harmful creatures who need to"
5588.100,5591.200," kind of defuse our harmful sides"
5592.000,5592.900," that there's more about"
5593.500,5598.000," the spirituality I mean this is I'm sure this is a gross generalization and I can't remember who said this but"
5598.700,5600.000," some indigenous Elder"
5600.400,5601.500," who who had a"
5604.300,5605.800," shakura was"
5606.400,5607.900," but anyway the point was like"
5609.400,5612.000," we indigenous people so to speak there was saying"
5612.600,5615.400," understand better than you civilized people"
5616.000,5617.000," that you've got to"
5618.700,5620.000," you've got to tame"
5620.400,5621.100," that a lot of"
5621.900,5623.400," spiritualities about taming"
5623.900,5625.200," human harmfulness"
5625.900,5627.500," human the negative side"
5628.800,5629.700," not so much about"
5630.800,5632.300," going into the positive side"
5633.300,5634.300," see what I mean it's like"
5634.900,5637.900," you know you can see I'm wondering be quite interesting to look at different"
5638.400,5638.700," sort of"
5640.000,5642.000," kinds of religion and spiritual practice"
5642.700,5643.600," you can perhaps sort of"
5644.300,5646.000," you can see how much they both"
5647.200,5648.100," recognise"
5648.400,5652.200," either side the positive and the negative or prefer one you know"
5652.700,5656.600," I mean there's some kind of Buddhism that are that all they really are is"
5657.900,5659.100," reducing the negative"
5659.900,5661.300," and there's other signs that are"
5662.400,5668.700," yeah there's the negative but man there's a positive two let's let's let's not forget that let's enjoy that you know"
5669.500,5671.600," and unless get with that so seeing"
5672.300,5672.700," practice"
5673.400,5676.500," whether you see practice as a decontamination Project"
5677.600,5678.800," or whether you see practice"
5679.400,5680.700," as a reconnection"
5681.400,5681.700," Project"
5682.300,5683.600," and I was reconnecting"
5684.200,5685.300," with what's marvelous"
5685.600,5687.300," the primordial jewel you know"
5687.800,5688.600," reconnect with it"
5689.500,5689.900," or"
5690.400,5693.200," is it just decontamination just detox"
5693.900,5695.900," just decontaminate you know it's"
5697.000,5697.300," I think"
5698.600,5700.400," it's probably safer to er"
5700.500,5701.700," on the side of the latter"
5703.100,5703.100," but"
5703.600,5703.900," of course"
5704.400,5706.000," the former can help with the latter"
5706.300,5707.900," that to get glimpses of"
5708.700,5709.400," a primordial"
5711.800,5714.900," boundless piece or primordial boundless love"
5715.800,5717.600," can be very inspiring"
5718.200,5720.300," for the project of decontaminating"
5721.000,5721.900," but either way I think"
5723.500,5724.800," did you get what I'm saying that"
5725.600,5728.300," you know they're doing some Buddhism just at all it is is"
5729.600,5730.200," eliminate"
5730.600,5732.500," purify the defilements"
5733.100,5735.100," yeah if the filled with defilements"
5735.800,5738.500," you got to gradually become aware of them and release them"
5740.000,5741.300," all you get other phone say"
5742.000,5742.900," there's original nature"
5743.400,5746.000," all you've got to do is find your original nature"
5747.000,5747.800," and then live it"
5748.800,5749.300," live it"
5751.900,5753.400," but how do you find it well"
5755.100,5756.400," usually you have to"
5757.300,5760.600," let go of the delusions that obscure it"
5761.800,5762.200," which are"
5762.600,5763.200," powerfully"
5764.600,5765.700," fortified"
5766.500,5766.600," bye"
5767.700,5768.700," Greed and Hate"
5770.400,5771.000," desire"
5771.800,5772.000," and"
5773.700,5776.500," aversion or this light or Ill Will"
5780.900,5781.000," okay"
5781.500,5785.700," anybody want to speak I see if you have a question you want to say"
5786.200,5786.900," rather than yeah"
5787.300,5788.700," yeah go ahead Mark hi"
5792.900,5795.100," wait we got to unmute you just a sec"
5798.100,5799.700,"I think I can do that"
5800.300,5800.700," yeah"
5801.300,5801.900," yeah there we go"
5802.300,5802.700," hi"
5803.100,5803.600," good yeah"
5804.900,5806.600," this is so resonant for me"
5808.100,5813.300," I'm still bouncing back from last night where I had a four-hour conversation with one of my oldest"
5814.100,5816.100," friends from High School we grew up down the street"
5816.400,5818.000," together and"
5819.400,5819.500," we"
5820.900,5825.500," well we did not go down the Horror Show of the Israeli Palestine situation we"
5826.200,5830.400," we talk a lot about politics and we were talking about the American political situation"
5831.800,5832.000," and"
5832.600,5834.400," to make a long story short"
5835.000,5837.600," after this really intense conversation I"
5838.600,5842.100," you know I I turned to my own practice and and and basically"
5843.500,5848.300," with the you know you could get lost in the weeds of all of these discussions and all of the"
5849.900,5854.800," you know nuanced of of these political things and I came down on saying"
5855.800,5856.200," look if"
5862.000,5863.000," there's other ring"
5863.700,5865.200," if there's other ring going on"
5865.800,5868.100," it's problematic like it's some level"
5869.100,5875.300," you know whatever this whatever the conversation is if there's other in going on it's problematic and if"
5875.500,5877.100," and if there's not there's right"
5877.400,5877.700," and"
5879.000,5884.000," you know and so I said yes or one for me you know and this is a very close friend"
5884.500,5890.900," who largely we agree on most things but but we've diverged in our 50 years of knowing each other you know"
5892.800,5893.900," and then and then"
5894.700,5895.000," I"
5895.800,5900.200," we were talking a lot about the rise of fascism that is clearly evident"
5901.400,5902.300," and I and I went"
5903.100,5903.700," berserk"
5904.200,5904.500," on"
5906.100,5908.200," what's happening in America with this topic"
5909.800,5912.800," and it was it was alcohol fuelled discussion"
5913.800,5913.900," and"
5915.400,5916.300," and at the end of my"
5917.000,5918.200," five minute tie rate"
5919.900,5920.800," my friend said"
5921.900,5924.000," you're you're all the ring right now bro"
5926.500,5927.400," and it stopped me short-"
5929.100,5932.800," and you know and and so that that's it it's um"
5933.800,5935.200," and I checked myself with that"
5938.600,5944.400,"anyway so thank you Henry for because I was saying I sit in a lot of I do a lot of groups"
5945.300,5949.300," and in the in a lot of the political stuff people shy away from and in these"
5950.400,5952.300," and I and I very much appreciate you"
5953.900,5955.100," bringing all this up today"
5955.500,5959.900," thank you oh thank you Mark I mean it's yeah thank you so much it's you know it's been"
5961.200,5972.900," I'm a clumsy fool you know so I I really and I'm glad to just at least are the topic in some way because I think and I do think this thing about othering I think you're right I agree with you totally and"
5973.700,5975.700," and I have to watch it in myself because it's"
5976.500,5978.000," you know honestly I I had this sort of"
5978.600,5980.700," pretty entrenched view since the age of"
5981.200,5982.400," 13 or somebody that"
5983.300,5983.600," that"
5984.400,5987.900," you know I won't go into the details but around Israel"
5988.200,5994.400," because my father was very involved in in Israel as well and tried trying to change the education system now and stuff"
5996.000,5997.200," but when I heard"
5998.300,5999.600," gebel maty"
6000.900,6002.400," and his two sons"
6003.100,6003.300," actually"
6004.200,6006.600," you know all brought up thoroughly in the"
6007.100,6008.400," bosom of Jewish"
6009.000,6010.200," life in North America"
6010.700,6015.800," but a really really very very strongly auntie"
6016.500,6017.900," Netanyahu let's say"
6018.500,6018.700," you know"
6019.200,6021.300," and strongly auntie the policies going on"
6022.500,6023.300," actually it was"
6024.000,6024.600," to hear"
6025.400,6026.300," the three of them"
6027.500,6027.600," so"
6028.600,6029.200," poji"
6029.900,6031.700," argue the points that I"
6032.400,6033.500," had been very attached to"
6035.100,6036.700," in myself for years you know"
6038.000,6038.900," it was helpful"
6040.400,6040.500," but"
6041.000,6041.900," they're doing it"
6042.200,6049.100," I don't have to do it you know it's like it gave me an he's actually and and suddenly I realised"
6050.200,6052.800," damn I've been over simplifying it"
6053.600,6054.900," because hearing then"
6056.500,6058.700," say what I would want to hear somebody say"
6060.000,6061.200," actually allowed me"
6061.900,6062.000," to"
6062.600,6063.700," to become more"
6064.400,6066.600," I don't know softer about the whole thing"
6067.100,6069.600," that I think I think of the poor is really people"
6070.100,6070.800," living in fear"
6071.200,6072.000," you know as well"
6072.600,6075.000," and it's not really their fault"
6075.500,6075.900," you know there's"
6076.600,6076.900," yeah there's"
6077.200,6077.700," there's"
6078.900,6082.400," ah I don't know it's so complicated I feel anything I say is going to just"
6082.800,6086.800," put my foot in it so let's Carol why don't you"
6087.600,6088.600," unmute please"
6093.900,6094.500," I Henry"
6095.100,6095.400," hi"
6096.000,6100.900," I actually have three questions they're not once related to this and then I have a couple of others"
6102.100,6106.200," I don't get to attend very often lives so I'm hoping I can ask them but let me know if it's too much"
6107.100,6110.000," the first one is just following on from this just"
6110.800,6115.900," I see you know you're the talk is really encouraging us to think about common humanity and"
6116.400,6120.600," what we have you know empathy for all beings and I'm just wondering within the training"
6121.400,6123.200," of your training on the path"
6124.500,6126.500," you know apart from more practice or you know"
6127.000,6128.600," this organically will come"
6129.100,6132.600," if there was anything specific mind training or technique or"
6133.400,6138.200," you know I've read Parma show drone and some of these you know in the way of the body safer"
6138.700,6143.000," if there's anything you use that helps you kind of bring that state open and remember"
6143.600,6144.800," in those moments to"
6145.700,6149.700," yeah yeah I can speak to that let me just do that first and then we'll see about the other two questions"
6150.200,6154.600," so yes I think what I find most helpful of all"
6155.100,6156.000," is developing"
6156.800,6158.100," you know coming back to"
6158.900,6160.800," a certain kind of spacious"
6161.400,6161.900," allowing"
6162.600,6164.000," that can let me"
6165.000,6166.600," feel when I'm tightening"
6167.800,6171.900," when my heart area has got a literally a physical tension in it"
6173.200,6174.800," and letting it be there"
6175.800,6179.900," because you know that's really the zone where all the hindrances when I could"
6181.100,6181.700," arise"
6182.300,6183.400," as a physical experience"
6184.000,6185.700," it's also the area where"
6186.500,6187.600," preference"
6188.000,6189.600," arises and preference"
6190.000,6192.600," is a mild word for what can be very strong"
6193.500,6194.300," strong desire"
6194.700,6195.000," strong"
6195.800,6196.700," dislike or hate"
6197.700,6199.100," and so getting to know"
6199.900,6202.500," that sort of almost like a muscle you know"
6203.200,6205.100," or whatever it is that activates there"
6206.100,6207.000," the the real"
6207.600,6208.900," sort of seat of"
6210.500,6211.600," like and dislike"
6212.500,6213.100," or hate"
6213.800,6214.500," hate and"
6215.100,6215.700," desire"
6216.100,6217.200," clinging grass being"
6217.900,6218.400," desiring"
6219.100,6219.700," anchoring"
6220.400,6221.500," you know vs"
6222.100,6223.400," pushing away hating"
6223.900,6224.200," other"
6224.700,6225.900," ring you know it would all"
6226.300,6227.600," really have a kind of"
6229.100,6231.400," physical slash emotional seat"
6231.700,6241.900," right in my diaphragm or chest and I want to get to know that and I want to give it space to show itself I don't want to eliminate it or raise It or compartmentalize it or suppress it"
6242.500,6245.200," the country I want to give it space and allow it"
6245.700,6247.100," because that's how it shows itself"
6247.900,6248.200," so and then"
6248.700,6255.500," then I can be in the in the the space of allowing I'm literally more identified with what is doing the allowing"
6256.000,6257.900," then I am with the pension"
6258.500,6259.200," if that makes sense"
6259.800,6260.600," and so I find that"
6261.900,6262.200," that's"
6262.700,6267.000," I love that practice because actually then I end up finding that even this"
6268.000,6272.000," miserable clinching thing that I don't want to be doing becomes beautiful"
6272.900,6275.900," and that seems to be the most Potent way of disarming it"
6276.900,6278.900," is to really thoroughly allow it"
6281.600,6283.000," but that's just me"
6284.500,6288.500," hey Nicole actually kind of why don't you tell me what the other two questions are and I'll see if I"
6289.000,6289.900," can answer one of them"
6290.400,6292.800," them thank you we'll the other two questions one is"
6293.500,6294.900," regarding the app"
6298.600,6304.500," kind of progressing daily versus repeating I have that question and my est the third question is"
6305.500,6306.200," I've had these"
6306.700,6310.000," what I think you've talked to Maddie or Awakening or glimpses"
6310.700,6312.700," and there are a company with a lot of Fear"
6313.400,6314.400," and panic"
6314.900,6315.900," and I wanted to sort of"
6316.300,6318.300," also just get some perspective on that"
6318.900,6324.400," yeah okay so that's that's something that let me just I mean with the app I think you do what you want"
6324.800,6324.900," you know"
6326.700,6330.400," with the with the with the with the panic the fear"
6331.000,6333.900," that can happen there's a first thing I want to say"
6334.600,6334.700," and"
6335.900,6338.600," it's very understandable actually because"
6341.200,6342.600," any sort of"
6344.300,6344.600," any"
6345.500,6351.800," I don't know what to start to put it like any Discovery that the way we ordinarily experienced"
6353.000,6355.700," is not as simply not the only way"
6357.400,6359.300," can be quite shocking because"
6361.300,6363.600," we've been so sure it is the only way"
6363.900,6369.400," this is what experience is it's this kind of thing where I'm in here in the world is out there"
6370.100,6372.400," you know or whatever and I kind of know who I am and"
6372.900,6375.300," so I don't know exactly the details and we"
6376.300,6379.800," maybe another time we can get it out of what you've been glimpsing but"
6380.500,6382.600," but typically I mean I would probably"
6383.400,6384.300," draw a line"
6384.800,6388.100," as a more on the Buddhist side I draw a line between samadhi"
6388.600,6390.400," and The Awakening and glimpses because"
6391.300,6393.200," in the Buddhist world samadhi means"
6394.100,6395.500," states of diep absorption"
6395.900,6398.800," which generally don't really challenged our"
6399.700,6400.400," worldview"
6401.200,6402.200," they're just beautiful"
6403.000,6404.900," and but in a bit but they don't"
6405.800,6406.700," suddenly show us"
6407.500,6413.100," that that you know we're not in here in the world's not out there the way we thought or something like that"
6413.700,6417.200," whereas glimpses will suddenly shift perspective from"
6418.100,6419.100," what if I'm not here"
6419.500,6420.700," at all or what if"
6421.300,6422.300," what I really am"
6422.900,6424.900," is all encompassing or what if"
6426.200,6429.500," you know actually the simply no separation anywhere"
6430.000,6431.700," there's a fabric that's one"
6432.000,6432.200," you know"
6433.000,6433.100," so"
6434.700,6436.600," yeah it's a matter just of"
6442.500,6443.200,"it just we just"
6445.300,6447.000," it's okay you know just there's"
6449.100,6454.600," yeah it's I mean what's what probably is happening is here some release of self"
6455.600,6458.000," and then something's revealed and then"
6458.500,6460.900," self jumps back oh my god was that you know"
6461.800,6462.300," right"
6463.000,6463.900," so it's just it's sort of"
6464.500,6465.800," it's sort of on the other side"
6466.700,6471.800," we're we're just more used to it's just there isn't a self to to mind"
6473.500,6475.500," it's back on this side that there's a self"
6475.800,6476.200," to mind"
6476.700,6478.000," about it it sort of in"
6478.700,6480.400," so it's quite natural to get"
6481.400,6483.300," little sort of startle response"
6483.700,6483.800," you know"
6486.000,6489.600," but just not not to make too much of it just you know"
6490.200,6492.000," just do practices that keep you"
6492.900,6493.600," after that"
6494.300,6496.000," keep practices that keep you quite"
6496.800,6497.300," quite"
6497.500,6498.600," you know soothed"
6499.900,6504.300," you know soothed as okay it's a well trodden path"
6505.400,6506.200," you know you know it's"
6506.800,6509.800," you just go gently at your own pace the pace is right for you"
6511.300,6511.600," okay"
6512.300,6513.900," so let me just have it yeah thanks"
6518.600,6524.400," yeah I love this comment here from Tracy actually you mentioned the incarnation to dehumanization separation of self other"
6524.900,6529.200," is even Lucerne wired seems that many indigenous cultures had a deeper understanding of"
6529.900,6531.200," interdependent slash"
6531.900,6532.700," original love"
6533.300,6535.000," I mean I have that sense too"
6537.300,6540.300," and but I think they worked at it you know they were"
6540.900,6543.300," they didn't want to forget their indebtedness"
6544.600,6546.900," I mean god there's I'm generalizing horribly"
6547.200,6547.300," but"
6549.500,6552.000," generally speaking you know from"
6552.900,6557.600," the some anthropological study I did actually at college way back and general Reading"
6558.300,6559.800," it seems that there's more"
6561.000,6564.700," animistic wisdom around acknowledging our"
6565.300,6566.300," human"
6567.800,6570.400," place among the great family of all creatures"
6570.800,6571.000," and"
6571.700,6573.300," and landscape and land and"
6574.000,6574.400," all of that"
6575.100,6575.600," you know and"
6576.200,6576.800," that is"
6577.700,6578.200," definitely"
6579.400,6581.500," encouraging a sense of interdependence"
6582.400,6585.400," rather than this sort of humanists independence"
6586.100,6586.300," you know"
6587.600,6590.200," now okay trace Nicole hi"
6590.700,6591.200," how about"
6593.300,6593.700," a question"
6597.600,6599.800," well the way I'm not hearing it exactly speak again"
6607.100,6608.300," I still not hearing you"
6610.100,6612.400," and assume that nobody else is either"
6614.600,6616.300," let me just have a quick look at all"
6616.900,6620.100," yeah you you're on oh no you're muted hold on I'm gonna unmute you"

6632.200,6633.800," okay well Nicholas"
6634.200,6635.900," I'm gonna I'm gonna go back to the"
6637.000,6641.500," the chat and if we can figure that out Sarah I don't know if that's figure out a bull"
6642.500,6642.900," but I'm"
6644.500,6645.900," let me just have a quick look"
6647.800,6652.400," dehumanizing my consciousness and a new deeper level from Carla thank you for sharing"
6653.600,6657.600," about Iraq or get any okay thank you I also had a Ukrainian Grandpa"
6657.800,6659.500," somebody else mentioned Ukrainian"
6660.400,6661.600," ancestors well"
6663.200,6669.100," thank you SRI arabind thought humanity is in a transitional state of being is a transitional state of being"
6669.600,6670.600," like a caterpillar"
6671.200,6675.600," we're in the process of evolving into a butterfly that's beautiful I actually agree"
6676.200,6676.700," I think that"
6677.800,6679.800," I felt that we are a bit of a"
6680.300,6683.400," sometimes in the old days when I was sitting in the vendor a lot I feel like"
6684.100,6685.600," we're all like bulbs"
6686.400,6688.900," you know plant bulbs planted in soil"
6689.500,6690.500," sitting there in our"
6690.800,6691.700," in our posture"
6692.100,6694.800," on the on the cushions in lines or on chairs"
6695.200,6696.000," just sitting there"
6696.300,6697.500," we're like a bulb"
6698.100,6700.000," and actually there's a phrase in Zen"
6700.300,6702.800," let the mind flower Bloom"
6703.300,6704.200," but sort of"
6704.600,6706.600," waiting for this Bloom to appear"
6707.200,6709.000," the bloom is already here"
6710.000,6713.800," it's just a matter of waiting to recognize it that are mines"
6715.000,6719.800," and are attachment and I was constriction into a sense of self"
6720.500,6724.600," is just it's fine it's just it's just a process going on"
6726.200,6728.300," among a vast"
6730.300,6731.400," array"
6731.600,6732.800," of other processes"
6733.700,6736.900," and where that too with that vast array as well"
6737.700,6738.400," and and"
6739.400,6741.500," I think that is a kind of"
6744.400,6745.700," yeah kind of a"
6754.600,6757.000," yeah that we're an intrinsically transformational"
6757.400,6759.300," state or something like that that we're"
6759.800,6761.300," I also think the sense of self"
6762.800,6764.300," is like a little seed"
6765.400,6766.700," that is intended to"
6767.300,6769.500," grow to open a germinate"
6770.200,6770.500," open"
6771.500,6771.800," brought"
6772.200,6774.300," you know because I think it's it's"
6775.400,6777.500," I mean that's a pretty weird view of probably"
6778.300,6778.400," let's"
6778.900,6782.400," but I I experienced it that way so in other words the census self that"
6783.100,6783.500," you know these"
6784.400,6785.900," we'll Buddhism in particularly"
6786.600,6789.100," particular perhaps might see as a kind of"
6789.800,6792.000," you know the the target is own of practice"
6792.800,6795.700," studying this self getting to know it see what it is"
6796.600,6798.100," um but actually"
6798.700,6800.700," is in a sense not a problem"
6801.500,6802.500," it's an opportunity"
6803.500,6804.300," you know because it"
6804.700,6806.100," it is what can"
6807.200,6810.000," drive us to practice and it is what can"
6810.800,6812.200," germinate and sort of"
6813.300,6813.700," become"
6814.700,6816.600," what it really is show us what it really is"
6818.200,6820.000," okay so now I am"
6820.600,6826.000," here no mud no Lotus exactly exactly know there's a lot here that I want to read but um"
6829.300,6833.400," what's this does the act of loving those who hate"
6834.300,6835.100," change"
6836.100,6836.700," the present"
6839.100,6843.900," I would guess yes I mean you know techna harness a great"
6844.600,6846.600," who's just up above is just a great"
6848.000,6849.900," knowledge of that I think"
6851.600,6853.400," that hate is an ended by hate"
6859.200,6860.200," I think we're going to stop"
6860.600,6860.700," so"
6861.400,6866.600," but as sorry Nicola we couldn't work it out and Francisco will"
