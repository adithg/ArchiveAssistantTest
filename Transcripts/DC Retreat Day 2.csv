3.000,8.200,"good morning everybody welcome to day two good morning everybody online"
8.900,9.400," and everybody"
11.000,11.800," online in"
12.300,14.000," person here in the DC area"
14.400,16.000," if you weren't here yesterday my name is Luke"
16.600,19.400," I'm going to start us off with a little bit of embodied movement"
20.200,23.000," a little bit of brisk light movement so I would say stand up please"
24.700,30.100," just be mindful of your neighbor's and give a little bit of space if you can't we have space you guys can kind of spread out if you'd like"
32.900,36.600," and yesterday we started with this today we'll do the same thing of"
37.100,42.400," very simple like put that put your hands on your hips for a moment look down at your feet step your feet about his wiser hips and just"
42.900,45.800," begin to let the weight displace from foot to foot"
46.400,51.300," and if it feels okay for you you can spread your toes open as you plug down into the four corners of both feet"
52.200,54.900," and then you can put your arms down by your sides and just a little bit of shaking"
55.500,59.400," just kind of like here just kind of grooving in place let's put what's called that"
59.900,63.900," and then we'll get into smooth breathing exhale together through your nose"
65.900,68.300," good and then circles with your wrist inhale through your nose"
70.500,72.400," good and then exhale and begin the bounce"
74.600,75.500," just let the"
75.900,81.500," breath become apparent in the way that you're moving gently from your feet to your knees and letting that"
82.000,83.500," vibratory movement happen"
83.900,88.700," you might feel this up to your armpits Your Collar bones write your face super relaxed your head can just kind of wobble around"
90.700,91.500," and notice how"
92.300,94.800," in time we're going to do this for about three minutes"
95.500,96.800," to start this simple bounce"
97.500,101.700," if you want to intensify it I'll tell you something that you can do and in"
102.300,104.700," a moment of instruction but just pay attention to breathe"
105.300,106.800," pay attention to tension"
107.500,107.700," and"
108.300,109.900," softened both breath and tension"
112.400,114.100," so funny this gentle movement can"
115.400,118.300," be replaced where we can observe default in doing"
118.700,119.300," in efforting"
120.000,121.700," so just finding us"
123.700,127.300," and what I find is interesting in this kind of an opening"
127.900,132.800," the breath becomes kind of a staggered motion in the vibration through the knees and the body like"
141.100,141.900," you can do that of your mouth"
144.200,146.900," notice how it comes really together we then with your mouth"
148.700,149.900," and breathe out your mouth"
151.200,153.700," really good feel this pathway really well your mouth"
155.200,156.200," breathe out with your nose"
156.900,160.300," and then breathe in and out and then whatever mouth or nose feels best for you"
160.900,164.300," and if you want to intensify the way this feels you can lift your heels"
165.600,167.900," and you'll feel this all the way up in your eyes"
170.600,171.500," waving to my brother"
172.100,174.500," is here with us today which is a great great joy"
174.900,175.600," and I'm here"
180.300,182.100," and of course all my other brothers and sisters"
186.900,190.200," so just notice that a little bit more rigor happens through the body"
190.800,195.800," as you lift the heels really moving from the bomb and your feet with maybe a little bit more of a bend in your knees"
196.600,198.400," you know we're into like two minutes right now and"
198.800,199.300," I find the"
199.900,201.200," the juice of this"
202.200,206.500," very simple chi Kong bounce opening happens becomes observable through breath"
207.300,209.800," and through also um the end of it which you'll get"
210.300,211.300," rotate stuff in it in"
211.900,214.500," less than a minute so lift your heels now and really let this"
215.200,216.700," thug be felt all the way up to your eyes"
223.000,226.000," giving the whole building the sense that there's a earthquake happening"
227.300,229.100," we're not in California so they wouldn't take that"
230.600,233.300," so arms like ropes really just kind of easy shake it"
234.000,237.000," and maybe do another lifting of the heels like 20 or 30 thuds"
238.500,238.900," with breath"
244.500,245.900," feel the back of your head relax"
247.100,247.900," back your jaw relax"
249.000,251.700," take them two more breaths with lifting of the heels"
253.500,254.100," up and down"
256.800,257.400," one of my breath"
259.900,265.300," and let the heels come down but keep bending the knees and take you my breaths with just the bends and you just make the bounce softer"
267.900,269.800," make the bread softer and quieter"
272.100,272.600," breathe out"
273.400,274.700," and through your feet stop"
276.100,278.000," and then breathe up from your feet and feel that"
279.600,280.400," smoothness now"
281.600,284.100," really this like and bought this arriving in your own body"
286.300,289.200," and so just For A Moment Like fill your bones and feel your flesh"
289.800,290.400," feel the ground"
291.200,293.300," feel your feet almost spreading down into the ground"
293.700,294.700," really from your naval down"
296.700,300.000," and from your naval up through your spine is there your spine was a string"
300.700,302.200," and your head was a healing bl"
304.000,304.600," and gravity"
305.200,305.900," you know kind of like"
306.900,307.800," this evening yet right"
309.500,312.800," okay so just very gentle feel your feet and your hands"
313.400,314.600," both kind of dropping"
315.700,317.000," into gravity on an exhale"
317.700,320.400," and then simply from your feet lift your hands up"
321.300,322.200," slowly as you breathe in"
323.000,324.400," it might take a couple breaths to get up here"
327.100,332.500," and so let the bones of your arms do the lifting and let them muscles in your hands all the way through your"
333.300,337.600," arms and down your torso down into your feet do the dropping take a breath in"
338.100,338.900," up through the bones"
339.800,341.100," and out down through the feet"
342.400,342.700," good"
343.300,344.500," and you can bring your hands together"
345.600,348.400," so just a little bit more muscle action as you take your hands up"
349.400,350.100," and you can look up"
351.000,353.400," good and then we'll let the arms come down just like this"
354.800,357.700," so just turn your thumbs out to the sides as you breathe in and look up"
359.400,361.000," and then spin your thumbs in"
361.800,363.800," relax your arms and drop your chin down"
365.100,366.000," just let this happen"
366.600,367.600," in your upper neck"
368.500,371.500," just like your hands are dropping towards your knees bend your knees a little bit"
372.200,372.900," breathe"
374.800,379.300," and then route from your feet when you breathe in slowly from the ground come back up"
383.200,387.600," and then just mindful of your neighbor Arms out to your sides when they get to about as high as your"
388.000,389.400," heart turn your hands up"
390.100,392.600," come all the way up and just grab your opposite elbow"
392.900,393.500," my default"
394.300,396.500," right in fact pull the elbow skin up if you can"
396.900,399.200," notice this is this is common head goes down"
400.100,404.300," so ears behind the arms find your breath here and drop your shoulders relax your face in your jaw"
405.000,406.000," then you need just a little bit"
407.100,407.500," take a breath"
409.400,411.200," good and look at this go"
411.800,414.400," and when your arms get to where they are shoulder I just let go"
415.000,415.400," Shake"
416.200,418.700," and then just stand again gravity and Point C"
419.700,421.600," and then we'll do that one more time breathe out"
422.700,423.800," breathe in and reach Up"
424.700,427.600," and this time grab your opposite elbow so feel different"
429.500,429.800," good"
430.200,433.100," and if you need to you can kind of like wag your hips a little bit and sit down"
434.100,434.700," bind your breath"
436.500,440.200," and just see how it feels to breathe into the bottom of your lungs and the back of your lungs"
443.300,444.300," and then stand up"
444.900,445.900," bring your arms down"
447.200,447.800," drop them"
448.400,448.600," but"
449.000,452.400," this just makes circles with the head maybe 10 times I'm One Direction"
456.700,458.100," stay with that soft breathing"
458.700,459.300," and then the other way"
466.100,467.900," and then from the head you can sort of in the news"
468.400,469.900," and we just do this little bounce out again"
470.900,472.300," let's put a little bit more Thick of the hands"
472.900,475.700," and we'll take a couple rigorous three rigorous breaths nose in"
477.400,478.100," and a hot sound"
479.500,480.500," really good again"
484.200,485.900," softer bouncing one more big breath"
487.100,488.800," and a softer quieter sound"
491.500,493.100," welcome every Friday thank you"
494.100,494.300," Henry"
498.400,501.000," okay oh man thank you thank you so much Luke"
501.600,504.400," yeah good morning everybody great to be with you thanks for being here"
506.600,507.600," I've ever had a good"
509.500,512.700," either live or restful or whatever was evening"
513.700,514.300," nutritional"
514.600,515.500," as well I hope"
515.900,517.600," we had some insane"
520.000,522.500," rotisserie Argentinian chicken I see that"
523.300,525.000," apparently with a staple of Luke's family"
525.900,527.000," in his youth called"
527.900,529.900," crispy and juicy if you haven't"
532.800,534.600," if you guys haven't been there oh my gosh"
535.900,536.600," it's so good"
538.800,539.600," anyway here we are"
540.700,541.000," right now"
542.500,543.700," we've already had a day"
544.200,545.200," most of us of"
546.200,547.200," doing this"
547.900,549.900," beautiful thing of basically"
550.600,550.900," is this"
552.000,552.300," yeah"
553.000,556.600," doing the beautiful thing of basically not doing"
558.500,559.700," you know interrupting"
560.600,562.400," the ordinary flow of"
563.500,563.900," of doing"
564.500,565.900," constant doing and then we come"
566.400,569.900," and we don't do we gather we actually get together to do"
570.800,571.200," not doing"
572.100,573.700," we get together to not do"
574.500,576.500," and what's the beautiful thing about not doing"
577.500,580.200," the really valuable thing about not doing it's not just like"
580.800,589.500," hey let me just disengage for a bit and be aware of what my life actually is because I'm not so caught in everything that I do and all the"
590.100,593.100," outward Focus that I ordinarily have it's not just"
593.900,595.000," to disengage"
596.000,596.400," from doing"
597.500,597.600," the"
598.100,602.700," even the best part of the not doing is actually"
603.900,604.200," being"
605.100,605.800," UN"
608.700,615.400," that's why not doing is valuable not simply yes initially it's valuable because we're simply not"
616.200,619.300," solely focused on the doing doing which which"
620.100,625.700," is you know we got to do things we got project we got relationships and all that's good and we're trying to help the world in the various ways we do"
626.400,627.300," great butt"
628.100,630.200," we're not supposed to miss"
632.500,634.200," the best part which is actually"
634.900,637.200," the Bare fact of existing"
638.400,639.700," the father we're given"
640.400,640.700," this"
641.300,641.600," moment"
642.200,642.400," to"
643.100,645.800," exist and experience it"
646.600,648.900," it's so easy to miss that"
649.900,651.100," but it's the Greatest Gift of all"
652.200,652.900," and it's not"
653.400,653.900," permanent"
654.700,657.600," you know it's it's you know the exists in this form"
658.200,661.300," as this consciousness that's aware that's experiencing as we are"
661.700,662.400," it's not"
662.900,663.300," actually"
664.300,666.200," a hesitate to say this but it's not forever"
666.500,668.500," okay so it's a gift that we're given"
668.900,672.400," and it's not that easy to unwrap it because we're so caught up in what we do"
674.600,675.700," and it's not forever"
676.300,680.800," we don't have forever in which to unwrap it now the reason I hesitate to say the forever part because"
681.900,686.200," it's a little weird when we really do receive this gift of just now"
686.700,688.500," and we do experience it"
689.600,692.600," in its in its it's in its fullness"
692.900,693.500," actually"
694.200,696.200," there's some weird way in which"
697.100,697.300," this"
698.100,698.700," very moment"
699.800,701.300," is actually kind of"
704.100,704.800," full of"
705.600,706.300," Eternity"
707.500,708.300," so so that"
708.700,710.500," it's a bit of a paradox because"
711.400,712.400," it's only this moment"
713.300,716.400," but when we really discovered that we are"
719.300,722.700," participants in this moment we're part of"
723.800,725.000," this moment then"
725.900,726.300," basically"
727.000,727.600," time"
728.500,729.100," essentially"
729.700,730.300," stops"
730.700,734.200," and the reason time stops is that we realize that moment"
734.800,736.900," that time was only ever an idea"
738.500,741.900," it was a one of those constructions that are going on in our minds making"
742.500,742.800," us"
743.300,744.700," experience filter"
745.500,748.300," the world in the ways that we do but it's actually just"
748.900,752.400," it's nothing more than an idea basically clock time is an idea"
753.200,754.500," it's a useful idea and we're going to"
755.300,762.100," you know meet and stuff like that and everybody's got to be there at the same time we can't have a meeting and was useful but it's only an idea"
762.800,765.000," it's not a real thing the only real thing"
765.600,768.400," as I saying yes it really is only one teaching"
769.300,770.100," and it's now"
770.600,772.700," it's just now because they're real thing"
777.800,778.100," is now"
778.600,779.000," and the"
780.800,781.700," to find it"
782.200,783.600," to really find it we don't"
784.500,787.100," we we don't only stop doing"
788.700,789.400," we let"
790.200,790.800," ourselves"
791.200,791.700," somehow"
792.600,792.900," be"
793.500,794.100," and"
794.300,794.600," done"
795.700,797.200," it's an undoing"
798.800,800.000," it's like there's a knot"
802.500,806.000," and some invisible hands come in and they UN"
806.400,807.000," tyre"
808.600,811.500," and the invisible hands are actually just this moment"
812.600,813.800," when we settle"
814.300,815.000," and stop"
815.700,820.200," our ordinary outward orientation and and do do do do do"
821.100,824.600," act act upon the external world when we stop that"
826.700,828.900," the invisible hands of this very moment"
829.700,832.000," and I'm talking about weirdly today but let's see how it goes"
832.600,835.000," the invisible has a different moment come in"
835.400,835.900," and they"
836.400,837.600," untie"
838.700,839.100," the knot"
840.200,841.900," they undo us"
843.000,844.700," or what happens when we're undone"
845.400,846.000," well let's see"
847.300,847.600," we'll see"
848.700,851.000," but it's what this whole strange Project"
851.800,853.200," of meditation"
853.700,857.000," somebody asked what is meditation yesterday how do you define meditation"
857.800,861.200," and I I wasn't it wasn't quite in the place to really address that question"
862.000,864.400," at that moment but meditation is is"
865.800,866.500," the act"
867.100,867.800," that isn't an act"
868.200,869.600," of being undone"
870.600,871.300," as sitting"
872.300,872.600," still"
873.200,873.900," and quiet"
874.500,875.100," and letting"
875.700,876.300," quiet"
876.800,881.000," come because you know I'm convinced there's a great ocean of quiet"
881.500,882.200," always here"
882.900,885.300," and it's ready for us to start to recognize it"
885.600,888.000," and when we do it undoes us"
889.200,889.800," and we just"
891.200,892.100," we we stop"
893.300,895.300," the story of who we think we are"
896.100,897.600," it just gets into rupt it"
899.500,901.900," and it's very nice it'll be waiting on the shore"
902.300,903.600," for us to pick it up again"
904.400,905.000," if we want to"
907.300,908.000," but for a while"
909.500,910.500," we can be free of it"
912.700,913.900," we can be free of it and"
914.700,916.900," it's actually the great gift"
918.200,918.600," is to"
919.900,922.200," is to be undone and to stop being"
923.000,923.800," the me"
924.600,925.000," that I think"
925.800,927.500," I am is you know this me this"
928.200,929.700," always it work there's a lot of"
930.300,933.300," conversation yesterday about you know how do I find this at a"
933.600,937.100," how do I get this how do I get the piece that's promised in these practices and"
937.800,939.100," I want to get it and"
939.700,941.300," the whole paradox of it"
942.100,948.500," is that you actually on the one hand yeah we train and we can pick up skills and we can do these things that help us that's"
949.000,952.400," one of these wheel tracks I was talking about yesterday on the kart track"
952.900,953.800," but the other one"
954.300,954.500," is"
955.300,958.400," it's like actually you don't have to get"
958.900,959.300," anything"
960.300,961.500," you don't need any skills"
962.200,964.300," you don't need any training you don't need any"
964.600,965.100," path"
968.100,969.400," it's already here"
970.500,971.700," you know and it's actually already"
972.900,973.100," not"
974.100,976.600," around you but it is actually you"
978.600,980.900," it's actually you know what we ourselves are"
982.000,983.300," is what we're"
983.900,984.400," looking for"
985.900,988.200," but the one who's looking can't ever find it"
988.900,990.500," because the one is looking is already it"
991.400,992.900," and it was it who was it Saint Francis"
993.600,994.500," what you're looking for"
995.400,996.300," is the thing that's looking"
997.300,1000.500," is the thing that what you're looking for is the very thing that's doing the looking"
1004.100,1004.300," okay"
1004.900,1006.200," let's let's do some"
1008.200,1009.600," let's do some not doing"
1010.500,1010.900," and let's"
1011.700,1014.000," let's let's let's let's let's let's see how"
1015.300,1015.900," ready we are"
1017.300,1020.600," without any trying you can't try with this but to be undone"
1021.400,1022.300," you can't make"
1023.100,1023.800," undoing"
1028.000,1030.500," because it's not it's not about doing anything okay"
1030.900,1031.700," so we'll have a sit"
1032.600,1035.200," 20 25 minutes I'm not sure exactly we'll see how it goes"
1036.000,1037.200," so get get comfortable"
1073.200,1073.800," so you might have"
1074.800,1075.100," eyes"
1075.500,1075.900," closed"
1076.300,1077.100," let's give it"
1078.100,1079.800," you might have eyes closed or you might have"
1081.100,1082.900," eyes eyes open and the gaze lowered"
1087.900,1090.600," you know we've we've basically want to be still"
1091.300,1092.900," so find a comfortable position"
1094.000,1101.200," if you do need to move of course you you must please do move don't hesitate if you feel uncomfortable to change position"
1102.200,1102.700," the only"
1104.000,1108.500," pointer is to do its little slower than you normally would"
1109.700,1111.300," so that you can stay aware of"
1111.700,1114.000," moving as you move if you move"
1154.800,1155.900," so let's start by"
1157.600,1157.800," finding"
1159.500,1165.000," our body coming in and arriving coming into the body being aware of the body"
1166.600,1170.200," you might want to just sway a little bit from side to side"
1170.700,1171.400," very gently"
1177.000,1183.000," or so if you're if you're sitting with a free back you can rock gently forwards and backwards a few times"
1187.400,1193.100," and as you're doing that or if you're sitting with a supported back just sitting still at while we're sitting here"
1194.700,1197.500," check that your head is really in a comfortable position"
1198.700,1199.700," between your shoulders"
1202.500,1204.700," you might find as comfortable to"
1206.000,1208.600," to slightly elongate the back of the neck"
1209.500,1210.900," it's lightly tuck the chin"
1211.600,1212.700," just Explorer that"
1214.200,1215.300," see if that's good for you"
1219.400,1221.300," then we are going to relax the jaw"
1223.300,1224.100," that in the jaw"
1224.900,1226.200," kind of slide"
1227.200,1229.000," a little bit down and Away"
1232.000,1233.100," a millimeter or two"
1239.200,1243.600," and right there that might bring a certain release into the whole body"
1244.800,1245.700," we carry"
1246.400,1248.100," a lot of tension in the jaw"
1250.400,1251.400," really let it go"
1253.700,1255.700," imagine there's a soft pillow"
1257.400,1260.600," just underneath your chin that your jaw can rest on"
1267.000,1268.500," peel what it's like to let it go"
1273.200,1276.100," you can perhaps find that the tongue also"
1277.400,1278.200," relaxants"
1284.400,1287.400," tongue is busy with a lot of micro muscles"
1289.400,1291.100," that it go let it rest"
1298.200,1299.900," let's shoulders arms and hands"
1300.900,1301.700," be limp"
1303.300,1304.100," totally limp"
1310.700,1313.700," at the chest go let it be soft let it be warm"
1315.800,1316.500," Slack"
1318.100,1318.700," let it go"
1324.300,1326.300," diaphragm and belly"
1327.700,1328.800," let them be soft"
1330.900,1331.600," warm"
1337.500,1338.100," whole body"
1341.400,1345.800," with a glowing warmth spreading through it right down the legs into the feet"
1350.200,1352.000," shoulders Arms hands again and"
1353.300,1356.100," all through the torso warm glow"
1357.300,1359.300," spreading up into the back of the neck"
1360.800,1361.300," the head"
1362.900,1363.300," face"
1365.600,1367.700," eyeballs in their little cave"
1370.100,1370.500," so soft"
1375.000,1375.700," nose and"
1376.400,1377.700," sinuses and cheeks"
1381.500,1383.300," lips gums tongue"
1388.000,1389.700," Everything pervaded by"
1392.400,1394.300," soft warm glow"
1401.000,1403.800," kind of endemic native actually to the body"
1416.200,1420.000," now we can notice that we're enveloped by the soundscape"
1437.100,1440.100," so you might really sense this here's this body"
1442.600,1443.400," and here's this"
1445.000,1445.300," kind of"
1447.100,1448.900," wrapping counter- pain"
1449.100,1450.100," I did down of"
1451.600,1453.700," townscape in developing the body"
1492.600,1494.900," and you might just check in is there"
1495.900,1499.100," some sense that you need to do something"
1501.000,1502.400," there's some sense that"
1504.000,1505.400," you have to try to"
1506.100,1508.200," do something or make something happen"
1509.000,1509.900," as we're sitting here"
1521.900,1524.200," and if you think there might be then"
1525.400,1527.700," see if you can kind of locate it"
1528.600,1529.900," perhaps somewhere in your body"
1532.300,1536.500," it might show up for example in the chest area just check it out"
1540.000,1543.500," that something needs to happen or the something you need to do"
1545.500,1547.800," or there's some right way to do this"
1555.900,1557.800," and if you're not finding anything like that"
1558.700,1559.500," fine and good"
1560.100,1560.900," and if you are"
1563.200,1564.600," see if you can really"
1565.800,1566.600," welcome it"
1568.200,1570.100," allow it to be a rising"
1572.700,1573.500," welcome it"
1577.800,1578.900," and so sort of love it"
1581.800,1584.200," that if feel recognized and acknowledged"
1612.400,1614.000," when allow it to be present"
1618.200,1620.500," as you also allow"
1623.600,1625.400," the sensation of the body"
1626.500,1627.300," to be present"
1632.600,1637.000," and as you're allow also the soundscape all the sounds that are rising"
1637.800,1639.100," to also be present"
1680.300,1682.500," once again relaxing the jaw"
1682.800,1683.600," and the throw"
1686.900,1687.500," tone"
1688.000,1688.700," shoulders"
1765.100,1766.900," if you can really taste"
1767.200,1768.200," being still"
1770.300,1771.500," what it's like to be"
1772.800,1773.400," still"
1787.400,1789.500," or even what it's like to taste"
1790.500,1791.400," dil nest"
1792.500,1794.600," that there is a stillness"
1798.100,1798.900," as present"
1842.000,1843.600," can we detect the"
1844.600,1846.800," yeah there's body sensations"
1850.200,1851.000," there's the sound"
1851.400,1852.300," sound feel"
1855.200,1856.800," and there's also"
1858.800,1860.200," a kind of presence"
1862.000,1863.200," and awareness"
1867.200,1869.100," still quiet"
1870.400,1871.200," awareness"
1919.300,1920.000," if that"
1920.800,1922.600," sense of awareness is not"
1922.900,1924.800," clear to you that's just 100%"
1925.300,1925.800," fine"
1928.400,1929.000," see if you can"
1930.700,1931.400," just listen"
1933.300,1934.500," and be with"
1939.200,1939.800," sounds"
1943.000,1944.900," and sense the whole body"
1947.200,1948.500," and be with"
1951.100,1952.400," a sensations of the body"
1953.700,1954.800," without doing anything"
1956.500,1957.900," just be with"
1959.500,1960.400," your experience"
1967.800,1970.800," and if you are getting some sense of"
1972.100,1974.300," awareness as something you can"
1975.800,1976.600," detect or"
1977.600,1978.500," or be aware of"
1980.400,1981.400," be with that"
1982.700,1983.800," and don't do anything"
2010.500,2013.800," what is it like if they're just isn't anything"
2014.700,2015.200," to"
2023.600,2024.800," get just be"
2049.800,2051.100," with and what's it like if"
2052.500,2053.600," there isn't anything to do"
2056.700,2058.500," they're really isn't anything to do"
2062.200,2063.100," just be"
2148.600,2150.600," really we're just resting"
2161.200,2161.900,"being"
2167.400,2168.300," a"
2173.900,2174.600," not doing"
2191.400,2192.300," sensing"
2199.500,2200.300," receiving"
2240.000,2242.900," if thoughts come up which they"
2243.600,2246.100," may do at times just welcome them"
2247.000,2248.100," receive them"
2249.900,2251.800," acknowledge them note them"
2253.100,2255.800," talk in the mind or images in the mind"
2256.300,2257.400," let them be present"
2410.800,2412.100," what's it like"
2413.300,2414.500," not to do anything"
2422.200,2423.800," really not to do anything"
2496.400,2498.200,"I'm gonna ring the bell shortly"
2498.800,2501.200," let yourself remains still and listen"
2502.600,2504.200," to the sound of the Bell"
2506.900,2511.700," and then sort of come out in your own time you don't have to have a hard line"
2512.700,2514.500," like this was meditation"
2515.100,2519.800," and now it's ended and now this is non meditation just let it be seamless"
2572.700,2575.900," when you're ready you might bring a little movement back into the body"
2594.300,2594.800,"how"
2599.900,2600.200," mmm"
2639.400,2640.700," the crowded Airport"
2642.200,2649.000," I used to be sent on writing assignments in remote and less developed areas of Latin America and often"
2649.700,2651.100," I flew through Miami"
2652.100,2654.400," I remember one particular time arriving back"
2655.500,2660.700," in Miami airport at what must have been an unfortunate confluence of circumstances"
2662.000,2665.200," perhaps several jumbo jets had arrived at the same time"
2666.000,2667.300," although there was an unforeseen"
2668.000,2669.900," shortage of immigration staff"
2670.600,2671.500," whatever it was"
2672.300,2673.600," the place was jammed"
2674.300,2676.100," hundreds upon hundreds of people"
2677.000,2679.500," were filing into towards the immigration Hall"
2680.100,2681.300," even the corridor"
2681.700,2682.500," leading into it"
2683.000,2685.200," was maybe 12 wide with people"
2685.900,2687.500," and hardly moving at all"
2688.700,2689.300," at first"
2690.000,2691.900," I had a customary reaction"
2692.800,2693.500," oh boy"
2694.100,2695.500," this is going to take hours"
2696.600,2697.500," standing upright"
2698.000,2700.000," packed among so many people"
2700.900,2703.200," all of us trying to get into the hall"
2703.900,2706.400," where our queuing and waiting would really begin"
2707.400,2710.100," ah this is awful I started to think"
2712.500,2713.200," it could easily"
2713.700,2714.900," have turned into something"
2715.600,2717.400," excruciating but luckily"
2718.300,2719.400," I have my practice"
2720.600,2722.400," I took an inner step"
2723.000,2723.300," back"
2724.700,2725.700," I became a"
2726.000,2726.400," mute"
2726.900,2727.700," the Observer"
2728.700,2729.700," it all flips"
2730.800,2731.600," instead of being"
2732.100,2732.900," a frustration"
2734.000,2734.600," it became"
2735.300,2736.100," a wonder"
2737.000,2737.600," a gift"
2737.900,2738.400," a truly"
2738.900,2740.400," precious opportunity"
2741.200,2742.300," to be among so many"
2743.000,2744.400," exquisite beings"
2745.800,2746.100," it was a"
2746.700,2747.600," rare privilege"
2748.400,2749.400," of course it was"
2750.100,2752.700," to be pressed among this Great Gathering"
2753.300,2754.600," of these wonderful creatures"
2755.300,2756.200," human beings"
2757.100,2758.400," who all had plans"
2759.100,2761.600," and things they loved and loved ones"
2762.000,2762.800," in their lives"
2763.400,2765.200," and all had consciousness"
2765.900,2767.300," and knew they were alive"
2767.700,2769.100," and knew how to love"
2770.100,2772.500," suddenly I felt blessed beyond measure"
2773.000,2774.500," to be among these upright"
2775.000,2775.500," balanced"
2776.100,2777.500," exceptional creatures"
2778.400,2780.600," just to feel their physical warm"
2781.500,2782.800," their intentionality"
2783.500,2785.300," and their innate kindness"
2786.200,2787.400," it was A Wondrous thing"
2788.000,2789.700," to be among that throng"
2790.700,2793.400," as I shuffled along in my place in the line"
2794.100,2795.900," slowly creeping toward"
2796.500,2798.000," the immigration counters"
2798.600,2799.500," I almost"
2799.900,2801.600," didn't want it to ever end"
2804.700,2805.300," not quite"
2808.600,2809.400," not all the way"
2811.000,2814.500," but actually seriously I I think it's some"
2815.200,2816.300," I wanted to read this because"
2817.400,2818.200," it just really"
2819.700,2823.700," I just got a little reminder actually yesterday as we were sitting in one of the sets that"
2826.700,2829.500," somehow is become I think quite easy"
2830.400,2832.100," to think of the human"
2833.400,2835.300," of humanity as a problem"
2836.200,2837.500," you know we're so used to the"
2838.100,2840.800," of course the climate crisis that we've created and"
2841.500,2844.000," and you know and obviously the wars that we"
2844.800,2845.600," we're so good at"
2846.200,2846.900," killing each other"
2847.900,2849.900," you know I often think of that thing when"
2850.700,2851.800," people are saying why"
2852.500,2855.800," why we're nervous creatures is because of the saber tooth tiger"
2856.300,2858.600," you know what I mean like we're we're involved because of"
2858.900,2860.300," to be anxious because of the"
2860.800,2861.700," the bears and"
2862.300,2862.900," the massive"
2863.900,2864.800," mega fauna"
2865.400,2866.100," rubbish"
2866.700,2868.700," it's because we're afraid of other humans"
2869.800,2872.600," the far by far the most lethal thing"
2873.400,2874.100," for human beings"
2874.600,2875.600," of being human beings"
2876.100,2876.800," by far"
2877.800,2878.500," and away"
2880.200,2883.100," um yeah I guess there's the odd meteorite and earthquake okay"
2885.600,2887.200," but basically you know we've"
2887.700,2889.200," we've been lethal"
2889.700,2890.400," to ourselves"
2892.700,2893.200," and yet"
2894.000,2894.400," actually"
2896.000,2896.900," human beings"
2898.700,2899.200," I mean I"
2899.900,2902.600," I've got to include myself in this are beautiful"
2903.800,2905.100," incredible creatures"
2905.900,2907.800," are capacity for love"
2908.500,2909.400," for cooperation"
2910.100,2911.800," for collaboration for"
2913.500,2915.600," anticipatory help"
2915.900,2916.300," for others"
2917.500,2921.200," for figuring out what others need before they might even know and helping them"
2922.300,2922.700," it's just"
2923.400,2924.200," it's incredible"
2926.500,2927.500," and you know there's a"
2927.900,2929.100," I don't know if any of you have read"
2930.600,2931.800," survival of the friendliest"
2933.100,2934.300," by Brian hair"
2935.100,2938.500," is a researcher Duke"
2939.300,2939.900," University"
2940.800,2943.100," is actually most of his research is into dogs"
2944.100,2947.900," how wolves became dogs our foxes maybe also became dogs"
2948.500,2948.700," and"
2949.800,2954.600," and how it's totally fascinating it's just I really recommend a book the survival of the friendliest"
2955.800,2957.100," as opposed to the fittest you know"
2957.600,2959.100," actually in is our"
2959.600,2960.600," collaborative"
2962.800,2964.200," nature or wiring"
2964.600,2965.500," Co-operative"
2967.900,2968.600," wiring"
2968.900,2969.500," that has"
2969.900,2970.800," got us to where we are"
2971.600,2973.300," in all the incredible things we've"
2974.100,2976.600," accomplished as a species and achieved as a species"
2977.700,2980.700," but unfortunately we still have some other wiring still"
2981.500,2984.900," you know the conflict on turn on a diamond to dehumanisation"
2985.900,2989.800," they taught he is I won't tell you the whole thesis but it's a great book"
2990.900,2991.900," survival of the friend is"
2992.300,2992.400," and"
2994.300,2995.100," you know it is the"
2996.100,2997.800," the it's we've got this"
2999.100,3000.800," along with this capacity to"
3002.400,3004.300," to connect very very profoundly"
3004.900,3006.200," uh we do also have"
3007.400,3008.500," the capacity yeah"
3009.200,3010.500," be really really vicious"
3011.200,3011.400," to"
3011.900,3012.800," humans we consider"
3013.700,3014.000," other"
3014.400,3015.200," and not human"
3015.800,3017.300," and it's it's unfortunately"
3018.300,3020.300," it's his argument is it's not cultural"
3021.300,3023.300," it's not like some cultures are nice and don't do that"
3023.900,3024.800," it's human"
3025.800,3028.400," you know and any human being can be turned that way"
3029.200,3030.300," and then he group of humans"
3031.100,3032.400," so that's why we need to do some"
3032.900,3034.800," training and some work on ourselves to"
3035.400,3037.400," be more aware of that capacity"
3038.200,3038.800," and have it"
3039.200,3040.800," be less easily"
3041.900,3042.400," turned on"
3043.800,3044.000," yeah"
3045.700,3046.500," that's one reason"
3047.100,3048.200," according to the old"
3049.200,3050.800," Buddhist view that's one reason"
3051.700,3053.400," we do this kind of practice"
3054.000,3054.800," is the training"
3055.500,3057.400," that defuses the so-called"
3058.100,3059.000," three poison"
3060.000,3061.300," sans and the three poisons are"
3062.900,3064.900," hunger greed grasping"
3065.400,3065.800," number one"
3066.600,3067.200," number two"
3068.500,3069.000," hey"
3069.300,3069.900," I'll will"
3070.200,3070.700," a version"
3071.700,3072.600," that can lead to violence"
3073.200,3074.200," aggression and violence"
3075.000,3075.600," and number three"
3076.500,3077.500," misunderstanding"
3078.700,3080.900," and the biggest misunderstanding is"
3081.500,3083.600," the mistake about who we really are"
3085.000,3086.200," and the separatists"
3087.300,3088.100," that we think is"
3089.200,3090.200," the only thing we are"
3092.000,3092.800," you know and so"
3093.600,3094.800," this kind of practice"
3095.500,3098.100," can can weaken and soften and dissolve"
3099.200,3100.100," at least a time"
3100.700,3101.800," some of these poisons"
3102.300,3103.000," these three poisons"
3103.800,3107.800," especially those first two I was talking about it yesterday afternoon the thing about preference"
3108.700,3110.700," how strongly that can reinforce"
3111.400,3114.100," my sense of who I am that I want this and I don't want that"
3115.200,3115.600," and you know"
3116.600,3116.900," actually"
3117.700,3119.100," preferences just arise"
3119.900,3120.000," but"
3120.500,3122.500," then they bring in their training this"
3123.400,3125.000," third confusion that"
3125.900,3126.500," I am"
3127.100,3127.600," only"
3128.300,3129.000," the separate"
3130.300,3132.000," individual independent"
3132.200,3133.300," person I think I am"
3135.400,3137.900," who is his really got to navigate this world"
3139.700,3140.400," to get the things"
3141.500,3141.800," they want"
3142.500,3143.300," and avoid the things"
3143.800,3144.300," they don't want"
3145.000,3147.000," not realising all along"
3148.300,3148.800," all"
3149.400,3151.000," along there's been a completely different"
3151.700,3152.200," picture"
3153.400,3154.000," reality"
3154.800,3155.600," this present"
3156.300,3157.800," and when we sit like this"
3158.800,3159.100," that"
3159.600,3159.900," other"
3160.900,3162.700," dimension of things has a chance"
3164.200,3164.900," to reach us"
3173.300,3175.800," and actually simply the act of"
3177.200,3177.900," being still"
3180.000,3180.700," can be enough"
3184.500,3187.500," and if we can't be still we can at least go a bit slower"
3188.700,3189.500," that can help too"
3191.800,3193.200," just going a bit slower"
3194.900,3196.500," this is a little poem called slow"
3200.500,3208.200," I was living in California quite a bit over the last few years where one of a dear beloved one was having a very hard time and we were there to"
3208.600,3210.100," try to support them my wife and I"
3210.600,3215.700," and first I didn't particularly coming from New Mexico where I live which is you know glorious"
3216.400,3217.900," deserts and mountains and"
3219.000,3222.300," and for gorgeous seasons and"
3223.100,3224.900," sumptuous chili and"
3225.400,3228.900," pinion and and juniper trees everywhere and the fragrance of"
3230.000,3236.800," pinion smoking winter and Autumn and it's all it's gorgeous and there's a very creative community out there in Santa Fe"
3237.700,3239.800," and quite a strong set of spiritual community"
3240.600,3245.200," and then I was in suburban southern California suddenly which is really very different"
3245.700,3247.400," but actually I grew to love it"
3247.900,3249.600," and one of the things that I"
3250.000,3252.900," grew to really love with getting down to the ocean early"
3253.500,3254.200," before the traffic"
3254.800,3256.000," and Dawn was just starting"
3256.400,3257.400," and I started and even though"
3258.200,3262.400," who would have thought that the sea is pretty actually cold in Southern California"
3262.900,3264.700," you know it's often in the 50s especially"
3265.500,3266.200," in the winter months"
3267.000,3267.200," and"
3268.000,3269.700," but I would go down and just jump in"
3270.300,3271.200," you know and and"
3272.600,3273.700," because it's a rare treat"
3274.000,3274.600," you know living"
3276.100,3280.700," 900 miles from the ocean in Santa Fe and like many mornings most mornings"
3281.700,3282.400," drive down early"
3283.200,3283.400," just"
3283.900,3284.500," get in the sea"
3285.100,3286.500," and it helped with the with the"
3286.900,3288.800," challenges we were we were facing as well"
3290.000,3290.800," slow"
3291.500,3293.500," the real me moves"
3294.100,3295.000," slowly"
3296.500,3298.800," he looks at things a long time"
3300.000,3302.000," until he understands"
3302.700,3303.500," what is looking at"
3304.800,3309.700," like this morning in the sea down by the Broad beach early"
3311.200,3313.500," when the sun was Bright Like oil"
3314.000,3315.500," on the water and the water"
3316.200,3317.100," was dark"
3317.400,3318.500," purple almost"
3319.300,3319.600," black"
3321.200,3322.100," and the sun itself"
3322.600,3324.100," the sun itself had just risen"
3324.600,3325.800," over the far roof top"
3327.300,3327.800," and it was the"
3328.800,3329.300," Seas"
3329.900,3330.600," surface"
3331.100,3333.100," it was the Seas surface"
3334.000,3335.400," the seeming thickness"
3335.800,3337.800," of it like animal hide"
3339.400,3341.900," but also Slickers tar and breathing"
3342.400,3344.700," moving and it's big slow rhythm"
3345.100,3345.900," the court"
3346.200,3346.300," his"
3347.100,3347.900," attention"
3349.900,3352.800," it seemed heavy like a blanket"
3353.200,3354.200," being shaken"
3354.600,3355.600," in slow motion"
3356.400,3357.300," it's colours"
3358.000,3358.900," and Folds"
3359.400,3360.000," lit"
3360.300,3361.600," by the morning sun"
3362.100,3363.300," he was studying"
3364.500,3365.600," it in enjoying it"
3366.400,3367.500," learning from it"
3369.400,3371.800," when all ready we were showering off"
3372.400,3373.500," at the public speaker"
3374.500,3375.300," and towering"
3376.700,3378.100," dry and getting in the car"
3378.800,3379.700," into the traffic"
3380.200,3381.000," and he was still"
3381.800,3384.400," to daring back trying to see the sea"
3384.800,3386.700," with the great light risen"
3387.100,3387.900," across it"
3388.600,3389.400," which wanted to"
3390.000,3391.500," show him who he was"
3392.000,3392.900," and his place"
3393.300,3394.000," in this world"
3394.600,3397.000," something he was always happy to learn"
3397.500,3398.100," again"
3398.500,3399.100," and again"
3400.300,3401.500," but someone else"
3403.100,3403.800," thought less"
3404.400,3405.100," heedless"
3406.000,3406.400," busy"
3407.500,3407.900," had already"
3408.400,3409.300," taken him away"
3419.800,3420.700," how easily"
3421.300,3421.500," you know"
3422.500,3423.300," I forget"
3423.800,3425.200," I told all these years of practice"
3425.900,3427.100," I had noticed you know I"
3428.700,3431.300," somehow I'm just captivated and loving it"
3432.400,3433.600,"ah but there's work"
3434.400,3438.200," gotta get back to work and I need coffee and I need to get into the day"
3438.900,3441.000," and actually it has tearing"
3441.300,3442.300," something in me"
3442.800,3443.800," away from"
3444.600,3446.200," and true love"
3447.000,3449.100," of this world and of being alive in it"
3452.100,3452.200," and"
3454.900,3455.100," yeah"
3457.400,3459.400," we don't have to do that actually"
3460.600,3461.400," we can really"
3463.500,3464.400," flow down a bit"
3465.700,3466.400," be present"
3478.400,3478.400," so"
3479.200,3481.000," coming back to the map"
3482.400,3485.800," that we were touching on yesterday which is represented in this book original love"
3486.300,3486.700," there's"
3487.900,3490.600," there's two parts one is a powerful this path"
3491.000,3492.000," the other is a path"
3492.600,3493.000," that has"
3493.500,3494.100," stages on it"
3494.500,3495.500," mindfulness first"
3497.600,3498.500," becoming aware"
3499.000,3499.900," of Here and Now"
3500.400,3500.900," as it is"
3501.800,3505.900," and that often means A Little Bit Of Heart opening has to happen"
3506.700,3507.000," because"
3508.300,3509.100," often there's"
3509.800,3510.400," we come home"
3510.900,3511.800," to hear and now"
3512.300,3512.800," and"
3514.000,3515.900," maybe that's stuff here that's not so comfortable"
3517.200,3519.600," and somehow we got a we got a be with it"
3520.600,3522.200," you know whatever difficulty it is"
3523.300,3524.500," and most of us are got stuff"
3524.900,3525.000," you know"
3525.900,3529.900," there's habituated mild anxiety is extremely Common"
3531.300,3535.400," that pull gotta go back to work whatever it is got a sort this thing out got"
3535.800,3538.800," the various problems that never quite let me go"
3539.300,3539.500," you know"
3540.000,3540.800," so we've got to learn"
3541.500,3542.900," how to be with that"
3544.800,3545.400," without doing"
3547.000,3549.500," and that takes a little bit of a heart opening"
3551.400,3553.400," you know and sometimes things come along in life"
3554.200,3556.100," that require our heart to open"
3557.100,3559.500," that it's very difficult to navigate"
3560.200,3562.600," and only heartbreak actually will let us"
3563.700,3564.600," so the release"
3565.400,3566.800," of what we try to hold together"
3567.700,3569.200," sometimes is the only way"
3571.100,3573.400," that we can move through some of the great challenges"
3574.400,3575.100," that life brings"
3575.800,3576.700," and if you're a parent"
3577.500,3579.800," you know your kids will break your heart"
3580.100,3581.200," if they haven't yet"
3581.500,3582.200," just wait"
3582.500,3582.900," you know"
3583.900,3584.600," and actually"
3586.100,3587.300," the house first of break"
3588.200,3589.600," because a broken heart"
3590.100,3590.900," is an open heart"
3594.000,3595.100," so that's one way"
3595.800,3597.500," that we learn to be more present"
3598.200,3599.300," is having our hearts broken"
3603.100,3603.300," and"
3604.800,3605.200," then"
3606.900,3608.700," it's great because then we can connect more"
3609.600,3610.300," as their second"
3611.100,3614.900," in or second zone of growth of practice through meditation"
3615.500,3617.100," is being more available"
3618.200,3621.200," recognizing that we're not a separate of they think we are"
3622.100,3623.500," being able to receive"
3624.200,3626.800," experience receive this world receive"
3627.600,3627.800," the"
3629.800,3633.000," conversation that's being invited from other beings and other things"
3635.000,3637.900," and that that part of us that knows how to be mindful"
3638.900,3640.200," also knows how to connect"
3640.800,3641.600," and knows how to"
3642.100,3643.200," appreciate this world"
3644.800,3647.400," and it's just it's living just under the surface"
3648.500,3649.200," of what we"
3649.600,3650.300," sort of skate over"
3654.600,3660.200," so we've been exploring a little bit starting to explore that second area of connectedness yesterday"
3661.500,3661.700," and"
3664.000,3666.300," that'll be part of what we do today as well but"
3666.800,3668.000," we're also looking to"
3668.400,3669.000," to the next"
3669.900,3670.400," sort of"
3671.200,3672.000," invitation"
3672.600,3672.900," of this"
3673.900,3675.700," second track of practice which is"
3676.700,3677.600," Finding flow"
3679.300,3680.000," and Flo"
3680.900,3682.200," is a well-researched"
3682.600,3683.000," condition"
3683.700,3685.000," that human beings can get into"
3685.700,3686.600," chicks and me hi"
3687.600,3688.200," was the Great"
3689.000,3689.800," pioneer"
3690.200,3693.300," of flow research in the 70s the University of Chicago"
3694.100,3695.300," me hi chicks sent me high"
3696.100,3699.900," if you have a look at this name your foot you're not know how to pronounce it I guarantee it"
3701.100,3702.800," but it's actually quite easy if you hear it"
3703.800,3704.400," chicks at me how"
3705.200,3707.700," good is that it's a Scramble of 15 consonants you know"
3709.500,3710.000," but he"
3711.700,3713.200," started to really"
3714.000,3715.500," really into this thing that"
3716.000,3717.800," lots of people report where"
3718.300,3720.400," they're doing some activity whether it's"
3720.900,3722.900," basketball or violin or"
3723.500,3724.200," painting or"
3725.400,3725.500," or"
3726.200,3727.200," washing up"
3727.900,3729.200," you know laundry and"
3730.600,3732.300," tidy in the house clean the car"
3732.600,3735.100," ordinary activities not just sort of special"
3735.900,3737.200," super athletes and musicians"
3737.900,3742.600," or all of us ordinary folks we will get into states of flow at times"
3743.300,3744.700," when we're absorbed in an activity"
3745.700,3747.700," and times sort of becomes irrelevant"
3749.100,3749.400," and"
3751.000,3754.300," we find that we're doing whatever the activity is somehow"
3754.900,3755.900," more fluidly"
3756.400,3757.400," and kind of better"
3758.000,3759.800," than we ordinarily think we can"
3761.600,3762.600," and it's very fulfilling"
3763.700,3764.700," it's a beautiful feeling"
3767.600,3769.000," so meditation"
3769.700,3770.600," is a really good"
3771.700,3772.300," crime"
3772.900,3773.600," crimes the pump"
3774.500,3775.000," for flow"
3775.900,3777.100," if we have regular"
3777.900,3778.500," quietness"
3779.700,3781.800," stillness in our life a little pocket"
3782.600,3783.900," 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes"
3785.600,3787.200," best of all twice a day"
3787.600,3789.000," even better if you can but"
3789.300,3790.600," having it in our day"
3792.400,3793.100," means we'll"
3793.900,3794.700," we'll likely"
3795.300,3796.900," drop into flow a bit more"
3797.900,3798.600," often through"
3799.400,3799.900," the day"
3800.400,3801.600," and not only that"
3802.200,3804.500," in meditation we can get into flow States"
3805.100,3806.400," it's known as Samadi"
3807.300,3808.000," when when we do"
3808.800,3811.500," which means something like everything held together"
3812.300,3814.100," etymologically samadhi"
3814.500,3815.700," all held together"
3816.300,3818.100," and there's a great sense of wholeness"
3819.300,3820.200," actually when we get"
3820.700,3821.600," somebody when we get"
3822.400,3823.200," meditative"
3823.800,3827.000," flow and the key difference between"
3828.000,3828.400," flow"
3829.000,3829.800," when your"
3832.200,3833.400," driving down a country lane"
3834.200,3835.200," riding a mountain bike"
3835.900,3839.000," playing a piano the key difference between doing it in an activity"
3840.300,3841.400," that's got an outward"
3842.200,3844.700," orientation vs doing it in meditation"
3845.300,3847.700," when we're not engaged in an outward activity"
3848.700,3849.200," is that"
3850.800,3851.800," in meditation"
3852.500,3853.000," when we get"
3854.100,3854.500," flow"
3855.800,3856.100," it's"
3856.900,3857.500," it's about"
3858.400,3858.700," the very"
3859.800,3860.300," condition"
3861.400,3862.200," of being"
3863.100,3864.900," it's about our very own"
3866.300,3867.400," being it's FL"
3867.900,3868.500," with"
3869.300,3869.700," just"
3873.300,3873.900," being and that's"
3875.000,3876.000," sort of wonderful"
3876.700,3877.900," in a different way"
3880.100,3880.600," because it's"
3881.700,3881.800," I mean"
3882.800,3886.600," you'll explore for yourself and see if you agree with this but my take is that"
3887.500,3888.200," it's wonderful"
3888.800,3890.500," because we're not doing anything"
3891.300,3893.100," because there's no outward input"
3893.500,3894.100," because we're just"
3895.000,3895.300," being"
3895.600,3897.100," and yet we're finding"
3898.400,3899.800," an extraordinary fulfillment"
3901.100,3902.600," even though we're not doing anything"
3903.600,3904.100," and when we're not"
3905.000,3905.900," needing any"
3906.900,3907.400," input"
3908.100,3908.600," from outside"
3910.100,3910.700," it's as if"
3911.300,3912.200," we're uncovering"
3913.600,3913.800," some"
3915.100,3916.000," place in US"
3917.200,3917.800," that's already"
3919.200,3920.400," thoroughly okay"
3921.800,3925.100," without any engagements you know with the outer world we're just"
3926.200,3927.200," in our very being"
3928.500,3928.800," okay"
3930.300,3932.500," and that's a beautiful thing to get to know"
3934.000,3935.400," it starts to"
3936.900,3938.300," sort of undercut"
3939.700,3942.100," are habitual cents that we need stuff"
3943.500,3946.500," you know that the outside is going to be the source of our"
3946.700,3947.200," well-being"
3948.000,3948.800," we start to find"
3950.000,3950.700," what if I've got"
3951.700,3952.800," an onboard"
3953.300,3953.900," well-being"
3955.000,3956.800," and it doesn't need special conditions"
3959.000,3960.000," I can get there just"
3963.100,3963.600," I mean still"
3965.400,3967.000," it's very special it's sort of"
3967.800,3969.300," it comes with a sense that"
3971.500,3972.700," can I put it that"
3976.300,3977.600," yeah like there's"
3978.600,3979.800," there's a blessedness"
3980.400,3981.000," about being"
3981.600,3982.100," at all"
3983.000,3983.600," put it like that"
3989.600,3989.900," okay"
3990.500,3990.700," let's"
3991.200,3993.900," do a little bit of connecting again"
3994.300,3994.900," and so"
3995.600,3995.900," we're going to"
3996.800,3997.300," pair up"
3998.400,3999.300," no let's get in threes"
4000.100,4000.700," get in threes"
4001.400,4001.600," and"
4002.100,4003.800," we will we will"
4004.300,4005.300," take it in turn"
4006.700,4009.400," you know to speak and the other two please just kind of listen"
4010.100,4010.400," as"
4010.600,4011.200," as a"
4012.200,4013.100," as best you can"
4014.000,4016.400," listen without encouragement just listen"
4017.300,4018.600," you know you'll find it"
4019.400,4020.600," you want to know and you know"
4021.100,4023.300," and yeah yeah yeah yeah but see if you can just really"
4023.900,4024.200," listen"
4025.200,4027.400," let the words flow into your heart"
4028.800,4029.000," and"
4030.500,4034.700," and what this what we're going to talk about is just any moments of blessedness"
4035.700,4036.200," that you've known"
4038.100,4041.300," whatever comes up you don't have to pick the right one just walk comes up"
4042.300,4043.500," okay we'll take it in turns"
4044.200,4045.400," and I think we're I won't"
4046.000,4047.800," yesterday I was trying to ring the bell when"
4048.600,4049.400," we traded off"
4049.800,4052.100," who's speaking but I think I'm not going to do that just"
4053.000,4054.000," we're going to have five minutes"
4054.600,4055.300," for it so"
4057.200,4060.800," do I need to ring the bell shall I ring the bell yeah I carrying the Bell okay"

4065.100,4070.500," okay and but it's not it's not an exact thing it's not the end of the world if it will have a bit of extra time"

4236.700,4238.500," or not the same as they have"
4239.600,4242.700," so in person talked about birdsong and how it's never the same"
4243.200,4245.400," you can listen to a bird and it's just not like"
4245.600,4247.600," always regular machines sounds regular"
4249.300,4251.100," write into the beautiful thing that is"
4251.900,4252.300," created"
4252.700,4254.500," anew and always different"
4255.500,4259.900," and then also in our group we talked about a birth or a death"
4260.900,4261.800," in ones life"
4262.900,4264.100," and how the same thing"
4265.300,4269.100," once it's happened the world is never the same again and you can feel the world"
4270.400,4270.600," as changed"
4271.200,4273.300," and you walk around looking at people how can you"
4274.700,4275.000," business"
4275.900,4276.900," has totally changed"
4278.000,4278.000," and"
4279.900,4280.600," the lines of"
4281.800,4284.800," your heart is broken and everything is new and"
4286.900,4289.700," different wow that's sounds like yeah quite a trio you"
4293.100,4294.900," this is the Power Group god that's a"
4295.900,4297.300," no that's really that's really"
4297.800,4302.800," profound I mean did did you all hear that yeah about renewal of some kind or"
4303.700,4305.000," some unrepeatable"
4307.100,4308.400," if I got that right yeah"
4309.500,4309.800," wow"
4310.700,4311.200," freshness"
4312.100,4313.500," well beautiful thank you so much"
4314.000,4315.400," anybody else yes"
4318.000,4320.400," Luke I'm tethered by all these chords so I can't"
4334.800,4336.300," give everyone your name"
4340.000,4342.500," think an art group as a reflecting now"
4343.600,4344.000," we really"
4350.400,4352.500," I I have been particular shared a story about"
4353.400,4354.500," taking my grandmother to"
4355.000,4355.400," be with"
4357.600,4358.800," other as everyone hearing okay"
4360.100,4360.700," great and"
4362.200,4363.200," for me it felt like"
4365.200,4366.400," there's a connection of place"
4367.100,4367.400," on"
4367.700,4368.900," where I'm from but also"
4369.900,4371.300," have experiencing the long"
4374.100,4375.000," Vamp"
4375.800,4377.300," and my group members also"
4377.600,4378.200," here at the stories of"
4378.900,4379.700," connections to nature"
4381.500,4381.700," younger"
4382.600,4383.200," fans kind of this interesting"
4384.300,4385.500," sense I was saying you know there"
4387.000,4388.500,"there there's this connection to specific"
4391.700,4392.800," then it almost feels like"
4394.200,4396.700," a layered deeper or more primal maybe as the"
4397.300,4397.600," connection nature"
4399.300,4399.800," so it was this interesting"
4401.000,4402.500," like multi-layered discussion"
4405.500,4405.800," about really"
4409.400,4414.200," well thank you so much for sharing that and we got another Power Group here that's amazing so"
4414.900,4417.100," so just if just checking I heard right like"
4417.900,4419.500," the censor connectedness"
4420.800,4422.300," whether that's to nature"
4422.900,4424.600," the biosphere that we we are"
4424.900,4425.700," in fact part of"
4426.400,4427.200," whether it's to"
4428.400,4429.100," Ancestry"
4429.500,4430.700," and they're lineages were part of"
4432.000,4433.500," whether so that process of"
4434.500,4436.300," new life coming new life passing on"
4437.100,4439.300," the connectedness was a key"
4440.200,4440.500," yeah"
4441.300,4442.600," that's beautiful thank you"
4444.700,4445.900," any any any any anybody else"
4447.100,4447.500," winning to"
4448.700,4450.800," impart the wisdom yeah great thanks"
4460.100,4462.500,"wait wait and please give your name as well"
4464.600,4464.800," yeah"
4465.100,4465.700," can everybody hear"
4467.800,4469.100," yeah hold it right close yeah"
4472.400,4475.700," something that came out"
4476.700,4476.800," you know"
4477.300,4477.600," he"
4477.900,4479.300," lower when you do something"
4481.000,4481.600," it hurts that"
4482.000,4483.400," digital challenge should meet your"
4484.000,4484.000," skill"
4484.700,4485.100," if"
4485.800,4486.600," two challenging"
4487.100,4488.100," you get the stress"
4489.200,4489.300," it's"
4489.800,4491.200," not challenging him might get bored"
4491.900,4495.000," but then when you talked about this watching the dish"
4495.200,4496.400," but just being"
4497.400,4498.500," it doesn't seem"
4501.100,4501.400," that"
4501.900,4502.500," just"
4503.100,4503.600," curious"
4504.800,4508.900," is it different kind of low when you do things better than just"
4509.300,4509.600," think"
4511.400,4512.100," so yeah just"
4515.400,4519.000," actually thank you for bringing that up it's it's true that the classic"
4519.500,4521.700," research on show is about on flow"
4522.400,4523.000," is about"
4524.300,4528.000," having a challenging task and you've just barely got the skills"
4528.400,4529.700," to meet the challenge"
4531.000,4532.300," but I personally"
4533.000,4533.700," don't agree"
4535.100,4535.500," actually"
4536.000,4539.000," I think you can enter flow in all kinds of conditions"
4540.400,4542.100," and I think that's"
4543.600,4548.400," that's just what that lens was able to see that the"
4549.000,4550.300," especially chicks amp knee high"
4551.800,4553.300," had in the 70s and 80s"
4553.900,4554.800," and 90s actually"
4555.600,4556.800," but I think now"
4557.500,4559.100," with mindfulness having gone"
4559.900,4563.300," so exponential I think we're learning that mindfulness"
4564.300,4566.300," can absolutely lead to flow"
4566.700,4566.800," I mean"
4567.600,4568.000," I believe"
4569.200,4570.800," that you can be in flow"
4571.900,4573.000," standing still"
4574.200,4575.200," you know have to have"
4576.300,4579.900," a task at all let alone a challenging one"
4580.700,4581.800," I I'm really"
4582.700,4585.000," feel that quite strongly and"
4585.900,4586.600," there's a"
4586.900,4590.300," I'm trying to think if I can clutch it any research that supports that"
4590.800,4594.900," I mean there is this there's this thing called the flow research collective and a little organisation"
4595.700,4597.500," founded by Steve Cutler"
4597.800,4601.100," you know who's written about flow really well in a book called stealing fire"
4602.200,4604.500," which is a great book I mean I I really"
4605.100,4612.000," thank you for bringing that up but it mostly because it allows me to say this that I think part of the whole point of doing this kind of practice"
4612.700,4614.200," is that you can be in flow"
4614.700,4616.000," potentially all the time"
4616.800,4618.200," you don't have to keep getting"
4618.700,4620.600," contracted back into the"
4621.200,4622.200," troubled self"
4623.000,4624.300," the anxious self the"
4625.200,4625.400," the"
4626.300,4628.400," threatened defended self"
4629.300,4630.300," you know really it's"
4631.700,4632.800," we can we can"
4633.400,4633.400," be"
4634.100,4637.200," developing compassion for that defend itself"
4638.200,4639.300," which softens it"
4640.300,4641.600," and and let's"
4642.100,4646.600," it do its little thing without us being caught up in what it thinks"
4647.400,4648.400," if you see what I mean yeah"
4650.200,4653.700," now any other group report outs for yeah thanks money"
4654.300,4654.800," can we yeah"
4659.200,4661.300," hold it really close to it yeah"
4663.400,4664.400," yes yeah yeah"
4667.300,4672.500," grateful I am for the opportunity to do this together"
4673.300,4673.800," I"
4674.900,4675.900," had never talked"
4676.100,4677.000," to my Two Partners"
4677.600,4678.600," before this morning"
4679.500,4679.800," and"
4681.100,4681.100," I"
4682.300,4683.500," real heart clinic"
4684.100,4684.200," with"
4684.700,4685.600," our blessings"
4686.400,4689.300," sharing them together and I'm just a great grateful for that"
4692.700,4693.600," thank you for sharing that"
4694.200,4698.100," yeah I do think it's it's really special you know that we can"
4698.700,4699.800," gather like this"
4701.100,4701.400," you know"
4702.800,4704.500," we I know quite a number of you"
4706.000,4709.300," yesterday they put out your hand when I asked whether you encountered the way"
4709.700,4710.000," the app"
4710.700,4712.400," and I think it's it's great that you know"
4714.200,4717.000," you do the app we do you know on your Honor on your own"
4717.700,4720.400," you know they can seem like a little isolated bubble"
4720.900,4725.000," but it's not really because there's lots of other people doing it as well and of course there's"
4725.900,4727.800," you know millions of millions of other people doing"
4728.400,4729.100," similar kinds of"
4730.500,4734.700," practice and I think the more that we're aware of that the more that we can connect"
4735.600,4736.800," better that Buddha"
4737.600,4739.200," famously said at some point"
4740.400,4745.600," well there's an old teaching in Buddhism and acting and I think other Wisdom traditions that"
4746.200,4746.900," that the"
4747.500,4751.800," path that path of spiritual development you need basically three things you need"
4752.700,4755.200," your whatever your habituated practice is"
4756.000,4758.500," you know other traditional terms of Buddha Dharma"
4758.900,4760.200," Tanga and Buddha"
4760.700,4763.700," is usually taken the you know of course it's the person"
4764.900,4765.500," sudata"
4766.500,4769.300," but it's really what the person did which was meditate"
4769.900,4771.000," daily meditation"
4771.900,4772.100," that was"
4772.700,4776.600," you know that was the habituated spiritual practice and other words"
4777.000,4778.800," a thing that we do that's not"
4779.600,4779.900," for"
4780.400,4782.300," all the other stuff which I try to do in life"
4783.000,4786.200," it's not for that it's for the Bare fact of existing"
4787.100,4789.300," and the gift of existing at all"
4789.800,4792.200," is dedicated the time dedicated really"
4793.100,4795.800," to that a habituated time dedicated"
4796.900,4797.600," to The Wonder"
4798.000,4800.000," the Marvel the absolute miracle"
4800.300,4801.700," of existing consciously"
4802.800,4803.000," you know"
4805.800,4807.100," secondly Dharma"
4807.800,4810.500," it's got a lot of means but basically it's guidance"
4811.600,4812.100," teachings"
4812.900,4816.800," and it's getting a framework so you understand the possibilities and why to do it"
4817.300,4819.100," but also getting specific guidance"
4819.500,4821.800," how to do it and step by step you know"
4823.500,4825.000," and then the third thing was"
4825.400,4826.700," Sanger community"
4827.500,4827.700," which"
4828.800,4829.500," on one level"
4830.900,4832.500," when he used the term"
4833.100,4834.600," 2500 years ago it meant"
4836.200,4839.900," the Increasingly enormous group of people who are doing it together"
4840.600,4844.400," you know the that kind of those first two things you know the"
4844.800,4848.900," butt more and more it's come to mean actually it can come to me in any way"
4849.700,4850.500," all beings"
4851.000,4855.400," you know it go all humans they can mean all humans that can mean all beings they come in"
4856.100,4857.400," all existence even"
4857.700,4861.000," you can sometimes get these flashes of experience that"
4861.500,4864.000," all is one Great Sanger"
4864.700,4866.900," including the asteroids and you know"
4867.400,4868.600," andromedae and"
4869.100,4870.800," the whole cosmos is that one"
4871.600,4873.400," community you can sometimes"
4874.000,4875.700," get a flash of that not to mention"
4876.200,4877.200," the mountains the rivers"
4877.900,4879.700," and the trees of the clouds and the oceans"
4880.400,4881.100," and the cities"
4882.100,4883.300," and the Ants of course"
4885.700,4885.800," but"
4886.800,4887.300," he then"
4887.900,4892.400," was asked of these three which one matters most he said"
4894.400,4896.100," you can do away with the first two"
4896.600,4897.300," as long as you have"
4897.700,4898.200," Tanga"
4898.700,4899.200," community"
4900.000,4900.100," so"
4901.600,4904.300," yeah it's quite a shiver really that one"
4905.900,4906.900," that actually maybe"
4909.400,4910.400," that's what we really"
4912.500,4913.100," really need"
4914.100,4914.600," just that"
4915.700,4916.100," so"
4917.000,4917.300," anyway"
4918.100,4919.000," we still do it with the three"
4921.200,4923.000," but it's nice to get this together time"
4923.400,4923.700," for sure"
4924.800,4925.400," I'm let's see"
4926.500,4929.500," maybe if there's just one more group so yeah"
4933.700,4935.300," wait wait let's wait for the mic because then the"
4935.900,4936.800," folks on like in here"
4942.200,4943.300," so yeah so"
4945.800,4947.800," everyone else is insane things are"
4948.900,4950.600," yeah these moments of life"
4951.800,4952.500," that or"
4953.300,4956.900," where our hearts trading open rival forget ourselves and"
4957.700,4959.200," we're in a sense of communion"
4959.700,4962.300," know with each other is it's a way of"
4964.400,4966.900," yeah just really like yourself break our hearts open and"
4968.200,4968.800," it's like the"
4970.300,4971.900," legs playing to them my my experience"
4972.400,4972.600," with"
4974.400,4976.200," losing my sense itself or"
4977.700,4981.600," you know where my eagle sort of dissolves into this state of presence"
4982.200,4986.500," and in my experience being with my grandmother was passing my family was there my heart was"
4987.100,4987.300," to"
4988.100,4990.600," deal with and you could feel this invisible red"
4991.200,4993.200," connecting our hearts together and"
4993.800,5000.000," you could feel some of them are stronger some of them are weaker and depending in the state you're in whether you want your receptive you can receive love"
5000.600,5001.200," or to someone you feel"
5001.900,5004.500," threat is a little better you can give love horses for it"
5006.500,5009.300," yeah and I think those are just really powerful moments and just"
5010.900,5012.300," where you can be in your"
5013.700,5015.500," person you know that your own me but"
5016.000,5018.600," you can be inconvenient with others and share that"
5018.900,5019.200," love"
5020.800,5024.700," yeah and then another note I mentioned space on weird but"
5025.200,5026.900," I mentioned astral projection where"
5027.700,5030.600," I would be I left my body by accident one time I told dying"
5031.100,5031.900," both scary"
5032.300,5032.600," and then"
5033.600,5036.700," I told a friend about it and tell me it was actually projection last for less"
5037.200,5037.600," problem"
5037.800,5041.500," so anyways I I've practiced it and someone told me that"
5042.000,5043.100," you got a wine bottle of water"
5043.600,5044.800," and the bottom of the little bit of dirt"
5045.200,5047.400," shook it up and said this is your mind when you're thinking"
5048.100,5048.300," you should model"
5048.700,5050.000," this is just the Ball still"
5050.600,5051.900," and just watch the"
5052.200,5056.200," Thomas town this is like you'll still have a couple of one's floating in there but you want the bottle"
5056.600,5056.800," computer"
5057.300,5062.300," and just Express your attitude and let it go yeah so I did that for a couple of weeks and then I was able to ask"
5063.100,5063.400," potentially"
5064.300,5067.700," and the only was exactly what you said this profound love where"
5068.500,5074.800," I didn't exist I couldn't think of the future I couldn't think of the past is just eternal Court is forever as you can possibly imagine"
5075.500,5077.700," and whatever sense I had of my body yourself"
5078.200,5081.200," it's like every cell was just filled with like this"
5082.500,5084.200," curious love energy and"
5085.000,5087.900," felt like I had like an orgasim anymore and"
5088.800,5092.600," it was just incredible and I was like floating in my room and then after a while I was just"
5093.500,5094.500," like I mean and then eventually"
5095.000,5096.900," come back into my body I love wow like"
5097.500,5098.400," you know what I mean yeah"
5103.300,5103.800,"so but yeah"
5106.800,5107.700," that's who we are"
5111.900,5112.000," learning"
5114.300,5114.500," yes"
5116.100,5116.900," beautiful beautiful"
5117.300,5120.100," another Power Group yeah the power room"
5120.700,5121.800," fantastic thank you Paula"
5122.100,5123.000," I just a little"
5123.500,5126.100," comment there that I'd make that actually"
5128.100,5130.900," don't all feel you have to learn how to ask your project"
5133.300,5134.000," some people seem to just"
5134.700,5136.400," have that kind of experience quite easily"
5137.000,5138.400," but it's not considered like"
5139.400,5140.800," a necessary part of the path"
5141.100,5141.200," but"
5141.700,5145.700," hooray if you get it you know it's very like a practice called Jana"
5146.500,5148.000," practice is a particular"
5151.300,5151.300," that"
5152.500,5155.700," that is pretty cool and you can sort of reverse engineer"
5156.500,5161.200," well actually maybe I won't go into it I think I won't go into that because it's not essential"
5161.900,5163.500," but it's but it's nice but the"
5163.900,5164.600," important part"
5165.300,5167.400," is the important part is exactly"
5168.400,5169.200," that sense that"
5169.900,5174.200," finding where we really come from and actually where we really are"
5175.300,5179.100," as they see you don't have to be in some special place"
5179.700,5180.900," whether it's astral projection"
5181.300,5181.900," or whatever"
5182.700,5183.500," it's here"
5184.500,5185.100," this this"
5185.800,5187.900," this this all encompassing"
5189.400,5191.000," thing that is no thing"
5192.000,5196.500," that is actually you know what we're and all this is kind of made of"
5197.100,5198.000," is always"
5199.100,5199.400," here"
5200.400,5201.300," and it can't"
5202.100,5202.600," not b"
5203.300,5205.100," A certainly appear"
5205.500,5206.200," to not be"
5206.700,5210.600," and most of the time it does not appear to be here but it is"
5213.000,5213.700," it is and"
5214.500,5215.500," and flow"
5216.000,5216.400," is"
5217.300,5219.500," a little four tastes of that"
5220.400,5224.000," it's a foreshadowing it's a hint it's a glimpse it's a Glimmer"
5224.700,5225.200," of that"
5226.500,5226.800," that"
5227.200,5227.400," just"
5227.900,5228.100," just"
5229.300,5230.400," through the reflection"
5231.400,5233.300," you know I was talking about that yesterday the lake"
5234.300,5236.500," the still Lake has a reflection on it"
5237.200,5240.500," and you look at it and it's so convincing it looks real"
5241.000,5242.000," but how thick"
5242.400,5242.500," is"
5243.000,5243.500," the reflection"
5244.900,5248.100," but that's sometimes use the as in the analogy for"
5248.800,5250.800," this experience we're having now"
5251.600,5252.600," that it's actually"
5253.900,5256.000," thinner than thin and just through it"
5256.900,5258.100," as the unnamable"
5259.600,5261.100," and it's all in his right here"
5263.300,5264.900," anyway I'm getting weird again"
5265.200,5267.300," so let's go let's have a sit"
5267.500,5268.600," before I say more rubbish"
5268.900,5269.100," you know"
5271.200,5275.300," and then in the afternoon there's a couple of pounds I want to share with you but right now we're just going to sit"
5277.200,5277.900," and"
5296.000,5298.300," so actually it's the same thing you know it's talking about"
5299.300,5299.600," don't"
5300.400,5301.600," don't feel have to kind of"
5302.200,5303.500," have a hard stop"
5304.200,5304.800," on a sit"
5305.800,5306.300," you know like"
5306.800,5307.400," it's over now"
5308.600,5312.900," it's just part of life you know same thing going into a sit"
5313.600,5318.600," don't think there's a sort of hard stop on ordinary experience and now it's meditation"
5319.700,5320.200," now"
5320.600,5321.700," we just just kind of"
5322.400,5325.600," Glide in is it's all really the same actually"
5326.100,5327.600," it's just a time of being still"
5328.600,5329.300," and quiet"
5330.200,5334.400," and we're really remember that lesson from yesterday about performance anxiety"
5335.600,5337.500," how common it is with meditation"
5338.100,5339.400," that there's something I'm supposed to do"
5340.300,5341.200," and I must do it"
5341.700,5343.900," and this is my chance and maybe I'm missing"
5344.200,5345.300," maybe I won't do it right"
5345.800,5347.700," and then I'll have missed this chance for some"
5348.300,5350.500," special experiences of special State of Mind"
5351.300,5351.700," rubbish"
5352.900,5353.700," we're just being still"
5356.900,5357.300," quiet"
5388.200,5391.100," let the shoulders kind of sag be heavy"
5391.400,5393.100," be relaxed let them settle"
5397.000,5397.600," bin is"
5398.400,5399.400," more or less upright"
5401.000,5404.400," and then sort of hang the body on it like an old coat"
5407.200,5409.000," the skeletal structure"
5411.000,5412.200," is the coat rack"
5413.800,5414.500," and the body is"
5416.300,5417.000," a lovely old"
5417.300,5417.600," coat"
5425.900,5426.600," dangling"
5427.300,5428.600," that yourself dangle"
5430.200,5430.800," limp"
5443.200,5445.200," in this check-in How You Doin'"
5445.500,5446.300," what's going on"
5449.000,5451.600," in quite a bit of sort of happened this morning"
5453.700,5455.000," how are you doing with it all"
5473.700,5475.400," and we're going to let ourselves"
5477.100,5478.300," really come back"
5480.900,5481.400," come back"
5483.400,5485.000," to just to just this"
5498.500,5499.300," nothing special"
5500.500,5500.800," just"
5502.300,5502.500," this"
5530.100,5532.700," so it's not uncommon that we have"
5534.200,5536.400," little impulses to try to"
5538.900,5542.500," understand something or realize something or experience something"
5544.700,5548.100,"we can be very kind towards those just let them"
5549.100,5550.400," let them The Rise if they do"
5561.400,5562.200," see if they might"
5562.600,5565.200," arise and just dissol"
5566.700,5567.900," as we allow them"
5569.500,5570.400," welcome them"
5572.700,5573.600," so we're really don't"
5575.900,5577.700," don't have to try and anyway"
5583.400,5584.700," what's it like when there's"
5586.600,5587.400," no trying"
5594.900,5597.300," what's he like when there's nothing to try for"
5628.800,5630.600," letting the body release"
5632.100,5632.900," be relax"
5645.800,5646.900," and letting the mind"
5648.500,5649.700," releases itself"
5653.500,5654.000," relax"
5703.200,5703.800," that's nothing"
5704.600,5705.200," special"
5705.700,5706.100," nothing"
5706.500,5707.300," to achieve"
5709.000,5709.300," just"
5710.000,5710.300," this"
5713.700,5714.100," I'm"
5715.900,5717.500," going to invite you to try"
5718.600,5721.300," repeating in in your own mind silently"
5722.500,5723.000," the word"
5724.400,5724.700," this"
5728.900,5729.000," this"
5732.200,5735.800," you might do it on every exhale or you might do it now and then"
5739.300,5740.300," see how it is fear"
5744.700,5744.900," this"
5814.600,5815.100," this"
5821.400,5821.900," this"
5872.200,5874.200," what if all we're seeking is"
5875.000,5875.600," is here"
5879.400,5879.700," this"
6273.600,6274.000,"okay"
6276.600,6279.400," so um thank you everybody for"
6280.300,6284.600," a lovely morning thank you Luke your guidance and support and help they'll be more"
6285.400,6285.800," in the afternoon"
6287.400,6294.700," um and that's we're going into break time I thought I'd just share a little little snippet of the poet William Wordsworth"
6296.100,6296.100," worth"
6297.600,6298.700," this is when he was"
6299.900,6300.700," freed from"
6301.800,6304.700," college and going off on a walking tours"
6305.300,6305.900," the Earth"
6306.700,6308.200," the Earth was all before me"
6309.600,6311.500," and where the heart joyous"
6312.500,6315.100," nor scared and its own Liberty"
6316.000,6316.700," I look about"
6318.000,6318.500," and should"
6319.100,6320.300," the Chosen guide"
6320.800,6323.400," be nothing better than a Wandering cloud"
6324.400,6325.200," I cannot"
6325.500,6325.800," miss"
6326.500,6327.000," my way"
6331.900,6331.900," so"
6333.700,6339.600," don't miss your way to Whole Foods or whatever you're going to lunch they're missing away back here either"
6641.100,6648.200," okay okay so welcome back everybody"
6651.900,6653.000," had a good break"
6654.200,6654.700," and"
6655.700,6658.100," maybe you've got some sense of that seamless"
6659.300,6659.400," but"
6660.000,6660.600," this could one"
6661.600,6670.100," one hour with meditating and that guy will walking next time we're talking they come with eating actually there's a phrase right through it all"
6671.900,6672.000," that's why"
6673.300,6674.200," this cruise right"
6675.700,6677.700," that's what we're really not"
6678.200,6680.300," meditation as a thing we're going to"
6680.900,6682.800," compartment where I got to do"
6683.500,6686.400," it's fine it'll be that for some of our life"
6687.300,6688.800," especially on the starting out"
6689.500,6692.400," but more and more I think even more like a tea bag"
6693.200,6695.900," that we're dropping into the warm water in our life"
6696.600,6697.500," so that infuses"
6698.900,6699.900," and it's"
6701.300,6704.800," but it's not as perfect magical buy anything because"
6707.600,6715.200," there's actually we rehearsed that"
6721.100,6723.600," yeah actually was more"
6726.100,6727.900," a more accurate method"
6729.000,6729.400," was being"
6730.500,6731.500," gun"
6732.400,6734.100," you know a murky cup of water"
6735.500,6737.300," and actually this natural came up early"
6737.600,6739.200," as we've got a mercy capital"
6740.700,6743.400," and because we're cutting it is stillness"
6745.500,6746.000," the"
6746.700,6747.700," Silk is 16 down"
6749.000,6750.200," and the water is getting clearer"
6751.300,6752.500," but that can't"
6753.100,6754.100," even the little"
6754.500,6755.300," meditation"
6756.100,6756.800," can't do"
6757.200,6757.600," a lot"
6759.000,6760.500," like the clarity"
6761.300,6763.400," is appearance more and more in"
6764.200,6764.800," and through"
6766.900,6767.700," and it can become"
6769.900,6771.400," so they say it can become very"
6775.000,6776.800," good"
6778.200,6779.800," there's a great constant"
6780.500,6781.600," and everything's presence"
6782.200,6783.400," and everything is also see"
6784.500,6785.000," and everything"
6785.800,6786.400," chopped through"
6790.500,6791.400," the unnamable"
6795.000,6798.700," in Islam that there's a 1999 names"
6800.200,6800.500," god"
6801.100,6802.200," everything will run as well"
6806.800,6808.100," it didn't really say that"
6808.900,6812.500," use the word love ten thousand times and everything that kind of wrong"
6818.200,6819.600," and you know this what"
6823.900,6824.300," anyway"
6825.200,6827.400," we I brought on the subject of bless"
6828.400,6829.500," you"
6830.600,6833.000," another little bit of that great point would"
6834.500,6835.200," this is a"
6835.600,6837.600," passage and his great work with friendly"
6838.900,6841.300," it is very interesting work it's a long"
6841.600,6843.500," one really long time no"
6844.300,6845.000," novel length"
6846.300,6848.000," electral the premise because"
6848.800,6849.400," it was"
6850.300,6851.800," supposed to be the trending"
6852.400,6853.400," to his great work"
6854.100,6855.100," like an introduction"
6855.700,6859.500," to the major work in planted the right for 50 in his life"
6860.600,6862.000," and he started out with"
6862.600,6863.300," the Premier League"
6865.500,6870.300," and I saw longer and longer person like a 500 lines earlier"
6871.400,6873.200," reasonable length that's whatever"
6873.600,6874.500," scheme cases"
6876.400,6876.700," and then"
6877.500,6878.200," it went on"
6878.800,6886.800," more there are more than over about five years between 17 in the age of 29 and 30 times 1799"
6889.100,6892.700," huge thing but it's still just the introduction"
6893.600,6894.600," to the real world"
6895.700,6896.900," you know and and"
6898.100,6899.000," he never wrote"
6899.300,6903.700," it's actually it already done it wasn't an issue"
6904.200,6906.800," that but I think the idea that it was just an ended up"
6907.200,6908.400," not that import"
6909.000,6910.800," with what allowed him to write"
6912.300,6915.300," he wasn't standing out to write them after seeing yes"
6915.700,6917.800," that was still to come this is just thinking about"
6919.200,6920.100," this therefore it wasn't"
6921.200,6921.500," okay"
6922.200,6923.400," so you want to try to"
6924.600,6926.300," anyway is a bit where"
6926.900,6927.500," it's been"
6928.600,6932.400," he's been away from home and his home when he grew up in the late"
6938.600,6939.100," beautiful in the word of"
6940.000,6942.100," but it is very beautiful"
6942.600,6944.400," and he'd been away a Cambridge"
6944.600,6944.900," study"
6945.900,6947.500," he hadn't had an unhappy time"
6947.800,6948.600," it's going to come back"
6949.300,6949.800," to the left"
6950.700,6951.400," home"
6952.000,6954.400," and there's a there's a kind of Village"
6954.900,6956.300," festival going on and"
6957.400,6958.500," he's up with an old friend"
6959.200,6960.100," dancing and"
6961.800,6963.900," you know three times from involved and"
6964.700,6969.900," and having a really great night and it goes on and and he's still awake at"
6970.400,6971.200," 5 a.m."
6971.800,6972.900," and they walked home"
6973.200,6974.600," over the hill back"
6976.000,6978.800," over her two miles I have to walk along the field"
6979.000,6980.300," if all I reached my home"
6980.800,6981.900," magnific"
6984.200,6985.200," a memorable"
6985.600,6986.100," pump"
6987.000,6988.100," won't glorious"
6988.400,6989.400," I've ever had to help"
6990.800,6992.700," see laughing at a distance"
6992.800,6993.100," all"
6994.000,6995.800," solid mountains were right"
6998.000,6999.200," brain to teach"
6999.500,7001.300," them life"
7002.300,7004.800," Green by the way with the red dime"
7006.400,7006.600," is"
7007.800,7008.700," from the mountains were"
7008.900,7012.500," all the solid all the solid mountains were trying to"
7013.500,7014.300," grazing"
7016.000,7017.400," in my"
7018.100,7018.600," really"
7019.400,7019.700," god"
7023.000,7027.200," in the valleys in the medals and the lower ground was all the sweetness"
7027.800,7028.900," common doors"
7030.800,7031.000," you"
7032.500,7033.300," the melody of the"
7034.400,7036.100," neighbour is going forward in"
7037.800,7039.500," I say dear friends"
7040.300,7042.200," that could have been my heart"
7045.100,7047.100,"oh the frame is the colour cod"
7048.800,7051.800," was writing"
7052.500,7053.100," this poem"
7053.300,7053.400," and"
7054.600,7057.400," need I say yes to the prince"
7057.900,7058.500," my heart"

7130.900,7131.900," he has a corner"
7133.300,7134.200," he had a corner"
7134.800,7135.600," as I should be"
7137.000,7137.700," dedicated"
7139.000,7140.000," dedicated to this"

7145.800,7146.200," appreciate"

7150.800,7151.500," in great"
7152.300,7153.900," whatever exactly that meant to"
7155.300,7156.100," be up"

7160.100,7160.400," all"
7163.500,7164.300," even yet"
7168.200,7169.200," just a Touch"
7169.700,7170.300," some kind of"
7173.400,7173.700," you know"
7175.800,7177.200," right it's very nature"
7179.000,7180.600," in white and wings"
7181.000,7182.300," sentences that"
7184.100,7184.300," you can't"
7184.800,7185.800," they"

7195.600,7195.600," that"
7196.300,7196.600," but he"
7197.900,7198.200," he"
7199.400,7200.100," was bad"
7201.100,7202.800," you know that"
7204.100,7204.700," Moses"
7206.500,7206.800," that level"
7207.600,7208.200," so the knowing"
7209.300,7209.400," of"
7211.600,7214.800," cherishing of appreciating and at the end of the rest"
7215.200,7215.900," all the way"
7217.200,7218.500," and that is it's"
7219.400,7220.000," tourism"
7222.700,7228.900," more than I mean I don't want to put words in the post now so but it seems to make connection with what we were hearing this morning"
7229.200,7229.500," good"
7230.400,7232.000," something about that connected"
7233.200,7236.400," that connectedness runs right through here and through the landing"
7239.200,7239.700," and"
7242.000,7243.000," that beautiful"
7244.700,7245.900," ate also on the"
7246.700,7247.700," on the belonging"
7248.000,7249.900," belonging in a leaning and longing"
7250.200,7251.300," in the world of being"
7251.900,7252.200," we have"
7254.300,7256.700," and there was a sensitive renew"
7257.400,7258.400," a new"
7259.200,7260.300," bringing on bless"
7261.000,7261.400," like"
7261.500,7261.600," that was"
7262.600,7264.400," that was led to what he organized in this"
7265.000,7265.800," little Kate"
7267.300,7267.500," so"
7268.800,7270.500," thanks to work with thanks all of you"
7270.900,7272.100," bring forth these products"
7273.400,7274.900," and that's let's see if we can"
7275.900,7277.500," maybe take from it that"
7278.400,7281.800," you weren't always doing mistakes less than that okay"
7296.400,7298.100," so let's we're going to come into a sit now"
7302.100,7302.300," let's"
7304.800,7305.900," let's see where we go"
7313.800,7318.100," the last set yeah we were we were beginning to pick up this little word this"
7319.600,7319.900," this"
7321.500,7322.100," just this"
7322.900,7324.200," was let's let's see"
7325.100,7325.800," if we might"
7327.700,7329.600," revisit that and see where it takes us"
7330.700,7332.300," but I'll be offering guidance"
7332.900,7333.400," as we go"
7384.700,7384.800," so"
7385.400,7387.000," get yourself comfortable"
7394.600,7395.800," if you are sitting without"
7396.400,7397.900," your back having support then"
7398.700,7399.900," check that your balance"
7403.000,7403.500," already"
7405.800,7411.100," really don't want to be working to hold ourselves up right so you can you can maybe just try"
7413.400,7417.600," tipping a little bit forwards this is for those with an unsupported back"
7418.100,7419.900," it's a little bit forward a little bit back"
7421.000,7422.100," find the midpoint"
7423.200,7423.800," where no"
7425.000,7427.200," effort is needed to stay upright"
7429.100,7432.000," and those of you with a supported back just rest"
7432.800,7434.900," yourselves into the support"
7436.800,7437.500," no effort"
7441.800,7444.100," we start to let the body release"
7446.000,7447.400," shoulders and arms are like"
7449.600,7450.700," tired old ropes"
7455.000,7456.500," go"
7458.100,7459.500," really let them be limp"
7463.900,7464.700," like the throat"
7465.500,7467.000," go let it sag"
7470.200,7471.400," jor is loose"
7472.800,7474.000," faces SLE"
7481.700,7483.200," let it be as if the whole"
7484.100,7485.100," body is"
7486.700,7488.400," kind of like old rigging"
7489.400,7490.100," on a ship"
7491.400,7492.000," at rest"
7494.500,7494.900," hanging"
7497.300,7498.700," from the Mars and spas"
7514.600,7515.100," and then we"
7516.000,7517.800," sort of let the mind just open"
7519.600,7520.300," open like a"
7520.900,7521.600," little flower"
7529.200,7529.900," it's as if"
7532.700,7535.600," the in the quality of restfulness"
7537.400,7538.300," of resting"
7542.700,7545.200," this is as if in the rest there's another"
7546.900,7548.400," kind of awareness"
7552.200,7552.400," that"
7553.000,7555.400," in its own time just sort of opens"
7557.200,7558.700," nothing is nothing special"
7559.900,7561.100," just a very"
7562.800,7564.100," very much part of you"
7571.300,7573.200," simple open awareness"
7602.700,7604.000," if you happen to be"
7605.700,7608.400," experiencing any traces of fatigue"
7608.900,7609.600," or tiredness"
7611.400,7614.000," let them be present don't fight them"
7615.900,7617.400," perfectly okay to be"
7619.400,7621.300," little bit tired or sleepy"
7621.700,7622.500," sluggish"
7623.200,7625.500," if that happens to be coming up here"
7627.300,7628.600," this be with it"
7630.400,7631.100," Let It Be"
7631.700,7632.200," present"
7641.500,7642.200," actually"
7643.600,7646.700," present Cohen about a master who was"
7649.500,7653.100," asked what is Buddha what is Awakening and he said"
7654.300,7655.300," I'm so tired"
7656.100,7657.300," I've been sitting a long time"
7669.400,7670.000," whatever is"
7671.100,7672.000," whatever is arising"
7673.500,7675.700," we're going to just be with"
7680.100,7681.200," don't have to do anything"
7682.500,7682.800," just"
7683.300,7683.400," be"
7684.300,7684.600," with"
7748.300,7749.000," can"
7749.300,7750.200," you can you imagine"
7750.900,7751.600," time"
7752.800,7753.800," almost like a little"
7754.500,7755.300," clock face"
7756.600,7758.400," somewhere in the corner of your"
7758.600,7759.100," awareness"
7767.400,7769.100," summer awareness of time"
7771.100,7773.200," tucked in the corner of the mind"
7776.000,7777.900," can you imagine that little clock"
7779.800,7780.500," disappearing"
7800.400,7801.200," can you imagine"
7803.200,7804.400," even just for a moment"
7807.400,7808.000," the right now"
7811.100,7812.300," they're really is no"
7812.800,7813.200," time"
7841.100,7842.000," what is this"
7843.400,7844.000," like"
7847.500,7848.500," when there's no time"
7916.800,7918.100," what if right now"
7920.000,7921.400," nothing needs"
7922.200,7922.900," to be different"
7944.000,7944.700," what is this"
7945.100,7945.600," like"
7947.700,7949.400," when nothing needs to be different"
8105.500,8106.400,"just this"
8110.100,8110.900," just this"
8146.800,8147.800," coming into"
8148.800,8149.500," really"
8150.500,8151.400," deep rest"
8151.600,8153.100," kind of Ultimate rest"
8155.000,8156.000," nothing to be done"
8156.300,8157.100," no effort"
8158.500,8159.100," no try"
8162.000,8162.700," try none is needed"
8164.700,8165.300," just this"
8268.000,8269.200,"letting the"
8270.200,8270.900," presence"
8273.400,8275.200," in the room hold you"
8280.700,8282.600," support you carry you"
8437.600,8438.900," don't trying to"
8439.900,8440.700," make anything"
8441.200,8442.300," special happen"
8445.400,8446.100," not trying"
8448.000,8448.600," just being"
8503.600,8507.900," just in the last moment or so see what happens if you bring a little"
8508.600,8510.300," half smile into your face"
8511.500,8512.400," that's my sitting"
8515.200,8517.600," the see if you can detect any effects"
8519.200,8519.700," of that"
8522.000,8524.200," in your body and your mind and your heart"
8531.400,8533.200," but no more than a half smile"
8563.600,8565.700," quarter smile 1/3 smile"
8566.400,8566.800," it's fine"
8582.400,8583.400," 18th smile"
8596.900,8598.900,"but not too fast that's too much"
8621.500,8621.900," bring a"
8623.700,8626.100," mentor or an Elder person or someone you love"
8626.700,8628.500," is helped you and your life to mind"
8630.000,8630.700," and wish them"
8631.200,8634.300," wish them well even if they've gone on already whisk them well"
8637.900,8638.000," they"
8639.900,8640.400," be well"
8646.100,8647.200," may they be happy"
8654.900,8656.500," may they be free from harm"
8695.400,8696.900," well let's see um"
8697.400,8698.100," I kind of"
8699.900,8701.000," want to just hear from"
8702.000,8702.600," here from you"
8703.000,8703.500," how's"
8704.400,8706.200," what's up for you or any questions"
8707.700,8709.500," you know that arising"
8709.800,8711.700," about details of practice or"
8712.200,8714.600," or anything else we could just take two or three now"
8715.200,8716.000," yeah great"
8716.400,8716.700," okay"
8717.400,8718.100," the can we"
8718.800,8719.400," have a mic"
8728.500,8732.400,"um so I was thinking about a conversation but power and I was having a Lux"
8735.000,8735.200," and"
8737.300,8739.300," I was talking about some confusion but I have"
8739.800,8742.200," when I meditate and some of the directions here"
8743.200,8743.400," which is"
8744.500,8744.700," great"
8745.300,8746.200," and I can do it"
8747.300,8748.900," sitting and just allowing"
8750.500,8751.300," this to be"
8753.300,8753.700," this this is the"
8755.600,8757.900," from the same time as I am trying to do that"
8758.600,8761.400," let's let everything be as it is and this is going to be looking for"
8762.500,8763.500," I find myself questioning"
8764.000,8764.900," but there's a suffering"
8765.900,8766.500," has changed"
8767.000,8768.200," yeah what shoulders are"
8769.600,8770.800," having anxiety"
8771.800,8772.800," and then I saw the question"
8773.300,8773.700," well how can"
8774.200,8775.400," this be it"
8779.100,8781.000," yeah yes okay thanks for sharing that very much"
8783.600,8784.800," did everybody hear that"
8785.200,8785.400," yeah"
8785.800,8786.000," yeah"
8786.500,8787.900," so here's the thing"
8790.400,8790.800," actually"
8791.400,8794.800," whether it's mindfulness or connectedness or flow"
8795.200,8798.400," or Awakening non-dual Awakening in all cases"
8799.600,8801.800," actually the way things are"
8802.800,8803.300," isn't"
8804.100,8804.400," the"
8806.500,8807.700," the thing we're trying to change"
8809.300,8815.500," that doesn't need to change our whole ordinary orientation is precisely that that is what I want to change"
8817.100,8820.200," but the meditative approach is very counterintuitive"
8820.800,8821.900," is that actually"
8822.900,8826.000," I am already pre-installed"
8827.500,8829.200," where they're kind of loving awareness"
8830.400,8833.200," that can precisely include"
8834.100,8836.700," those things which I think I can't"
8838.200,8839.300," happily include"
8840.100,8841.900," that's actually what the journey is"
8842.500,8843.500," it's not a journey"
8844.600,8847.200," it's just a little tiny marginal"
8848.000,8849.100," expansion of"
8850.600,8851.200," embrace"
8851.600,8853.000," of capacity of holding"
8853.800,8855.800," it's so small it's like that"
8856.700,8860.400," the I think it's a thin as the reflection on the water"
8861.200,8862.200," is that thin"
8862.800,8864.000," but it makes all the difference"
8864.500,8865.800," just that tiny little"
8866.400,8867.600," chink in the armour"
8868.200,8876.200," and again a forgive me I like switching metaphors really clumsily it's one of my favorite things but it's like a little chink in the armor"
8877.100,8879.700," just enough to let in a little bit of light"
8879.900,8882.900," and we see that there are very thing that was the problem"
8884.000,8886.300," is not really a problem"
8886.800,8888.800," the problem with thinking it was a problem"
8889.500,8889.700," and"
8890.000,8891.200," of course we have real"
8891.600,8894.100," you know big problems that is a problem"
8895.200,8898.600," you know my daughter's really in trouble that is a problem"
8899.000,8901.000," don't tell me it's not a problem it is a problem"
8901.600,8902.700," and that's on"
8903.200,8904.700," one level true"
8905.100,8906.400," and that the same time"
8907.000,8907.800," it's possible"
8908.300,8910.200," for that to be the problem it is"
8910.900,8912.300," and for there to be"
8913.000,8915.900," what Tara black has called radical acceptance"
8917.400,8919.800," actually that's actually I think it really came from"
8920.900,8921.800," Marshall Linden"
8922.300,8923.700," and dialectical behaviour therapy"
8924.100,8924.900," radical"
8925.400,8926.600," acceptance that means"
8927.300,8929.400," accepting what cannot be accepted"
8930.200,8931.900," what are some level is unacceptable"
8932.400,8934.200," now actually is a way to"
8935.000,8936.300," accept it but it's not"
8937.000,8939.700," within our ordinary understanding of accepting"
8940.300,8941.600," it's bigger than that"
8942.000,8943.900," and it's that tiny little bit bigger"
8944.700,8947.100," that is the heart of this whole process"
8947.700,8948.500," because it's not"
8950.800,8955.200," it's as I'm making any sense like it's it doesn't make sense but we can do it"
8956.100,8960.300," somehow it against all the odds and against all calculation against all logic"
8960.900,8961.900," which would say we can't"
8962.800,8963.500," somehow we can"
8964.500,8966.400," you know and I sometimes have"
8967.600,8970.900," sort of it in my own terminology as a wild Trust"
8972.000,8975.200," it's sort of feels a bit like that when I get them myself when something's going on"
8975.900,8977.400," the requires it"
8978.000,8980.800," I mean I'll often shrink and I can track and I don't want to"
8981.500,8983.000," you can't require that of me"
8983.700,8984.200," no way"
8984.700,8984.900," you know"
8985.300,8985.900," but somehow"
8986.600,8987.400," suddenly I can"
8988.300,8989.700," and it's a wild Trust"
8990.200,8991.100," it's wild because"
8991.800,8992.700," it's unconditional"
8994.100,8996.300," you know it's an unconditional oh"
8996.900,8998.000," acceptance it's"
8998.400,8998.900," it's not"
9000.000,9000.900," based on anything"
9002.300,9003.100," it's unconditional"
9003.900,9004.200," and the"
9005.400,9008.100," you know the the horrifying thing about that is unconditional"
9008.600,9008.700," you know"
9009.300,9011.200," and the good thing about it is unconditional"
9011.600,9012.100," it doesn't"
9013.400,9014.900," it doesn't depend on anything"
9015.800,9016.800," you know there and I think"
9017.500,9021.000," that makes it aligned with or in alignment with"
9021.700,9029.600," the greater reality the the the awakening the fourth Inn in my book is Awakening you know it's that other car"
9029.900,9031.100," track the other track"
9031.600,9034.500," the other wheel rut of the car"
9034.900,9036.900," track that is unable with no path"
9037.200,9037.900," it's always here"
9038.500,9040.500," it seems like it's never here but actually it's always here"
9040.900,9041.400," you know that"
9042.800,9044.200," is unconditional"
9045.000,9047.200," and that's the great beauty of it is that"
9047.800,9050.200," lots of things about our practice are conditional"
9050.900,9052.000," if I really you know"
9052.600,9057.400," put aside the time I do my mindfulness I'm going to slowly get more mindful"
9057.700,9060.800," and when we slowly increase my capacity to be with"
9061.300,9063.200," experience as it arises whatever it is"
9063.600,9066.400," I'm going to increase in that way it's going to incrementally"
9067.000,9067.400," grow"
9071.400,9079.000," although actually was really happening is it's not incrementally growing what's incrementally growing with my capacity to open up to it"
9079.500,9081.000," that is incrementally growing"
9082.700,9084.400," on the other hand so that's conditional"
9084.700,9085.700," but on the other hand"
9085.900,9087.200," The Awakening thing"
9087.700,9089.000," it's non-conditional"
9090.300,9091.200," that's why"
9092.400,9095.000," practice can't make it happen"
9095.800,9100.000," you know there's a famous line from a Zen teacher ate Robert Aitken roshi said"
9101.100,9102.200," he said enlightenment"
9102.500,9103.400," is an accident"
9104.800,9105.800," and practice"
9106.200,9108.600," can make you accident prone"
9110.300,9111.300," but that's all it can do"
9112.000,9112.200," you know"
9113.100,9116.200," and yeah it's one of the wisdom's"
9117.000,9119.400," in zen is that it understands that"
9121.000,9122.000," and it believes that"
9122.500,9123.700," it believes that"
9124.200,9126.500," you can add a little fertilizer"
9127.900,9131.100," that might increase the accident prone nests"
9131.900,9133.700," so it has these little commands"
9134.800,9135.300," that are"
9136.100,9137.300," weird little phrases"
9137.800,9139.300," does a dog have Buddha nature"
9141.800,9142.200," Mo"
9143.200,9145.000," just the word move which means not"
9147.700,9152.500," there's a both coins actually they're related the two parts of one car but they each is a coma"
9152.900,9155.100," it's a little phrase you can bring into your meditation"
9156.700,9161.300," and you see if it's helpful or not you know it might be who knows"
9161.700,9163.200," what is the sound of one hand"
9163.900,9165.600," you know the sound of two hands clapping"
9167.600,9169.400," but do you know the sound of one"
9172.200,9175.500," there what that he'll does that mean you know but that's a color you know"
9176.100,9181.000," it's a coin and sometimes people sit with it in their meditation they bring it in"
9181.500,9182.800," what is the sound of one hand"
9183.600,9186.000," and very often they think this is a waste of time"
9186.300,9187.700," but sometimes they stick with it"
9188.000,9188.600," and sometimes"
9190.400,9191.300," I don't know where"
9191.600,9192.100," they have some"
9192.600,9193.600," cosmic Awakening"
9194.300,9195.600," with this phrase that makes no sense"
9198.100,9198.200," Who"
9198.900,9199.200," is"
9199.900,9200.200," hearing"
9202.400,9203.000," who is it"
9203.800,9204.100," hearing"
9205.300,9205.800," that's another one"
9212.200,9212.600," what"
9213.400,9213.700," is"
9214.800,9215.000," this"
9217.900,9218.300," that's another"
9219.500,9219.700," um"
9220.800,9221.400," make"
9222.100,9223.100," Mount Fuji"
9223.600,9224.800," take three"
9225.800,9226.400," steps"
9228.800,9229.000," why"
9231.300,9231.900," that's another one"
9233.100,9233.700," stop"
9235.200,9237.200," people I can I can do this one"
9242.500,9242.800," okay"
9243.900,9244.200," stop"
9245.100,9245.500," the"
9246.400,9247.500," sound of the distant"
9248.100,9248.600," Bell"
9263.000,9264.800," well the earth are you talking about"
9265.300,9267.200," stop the sound of the Bell"
9269.600,9270.500," oh I'll do that"
9272.700,9274.000," no no no no no no no no"
9282.200,9285.300," yeah not yet that's what this end teacher was say"
9286.000,9287.600," if you do that the same not yet"
9288.300,9288.800," thank you very much"
9289.200,9289.800," not yet"
9293.700,9295.500," well my one of my Master's would say"
9296.400,9298.100," yeah yeah Henry so if"
9299.300,9299.600," 50%"
9300.700,9301.100," 50%"
9303.600,9304.700," sometimes hit even say"
9305.600,9306.500," 80%"
9307.900,9309.200," but that meant no"
9309.400,9311.400," it was a polite way of saying no"
9313.400,9313.800," yeah"
9317.400,9318.600," if it was just"
9319.200,9321.600," you know put your hand on it and stop the Bell"
9322.700,9324.800," that involves no change"
9326.800,9328.000," in the basic model"
9328.800,9330.000," how you experiencing in the world"
9331.100,9332.600," but coins are designed to"
9334.400,9336.300," bring about a real shift"
9336.700,9337.600," in how you experience"
9338.900,9339.500," this moment"
9341.000,9341.700," but actually"
9342.400,9345.100," their own lead like I said fertilizer because"
9346.000,9346.300," that"
9346.700,9347.100," shift"
9347.900,9350.600," is somehow possible for all of us anyway"
9351.600,9352.200," you know and"
9353.000,9353.100," and"
9354.100,9355.300," I think most of us"
9356.600,9358.300," at some time rather have had some"
9359.000,9361.600," little shimmer's or glimmers or glimpses or"
9362.800,9363.300," just little"
9364.000,9364.600," little"
9365.300,9368.100," ripples in our ordinary way of experiencing that"
9368.800,9370.700," that bring an echo of it"
9370.900,9371.000," you know"
9372.200,9372.300," and"
9373.800,9373.900," yeah"
9374.600,9375.900," meditation practice"
9376.700,9377.300," sometimes"
9377.700,9378.400," combined"
9379.000,9379.600," with with"
9380.100,9382.800," particular practices including possibly"
9383.400,9384.300," a coin or two"
9384.900,9385.200," can"
9385.700,9386.200," can do that"
9389.200,9391.800," but so can real heartbreak"
9392.400,9395.800," I've known many students actually over the years who've"
9396.400,9398.300," who've had some catastrophic loss"
9399.100,9405.200," and somewhere in the grieving process doesn't have to be in like at the moment of the last but somewhere in the grieving process"
9406.000,9408.200," there there has been some moment when"
9408.900,9411.200," they really just had to kind of let go"
9412.000,9413.200," in a large way"
9414.200,9414.900," and and"
9416.100,9417.000," stop resisting"
9418.000,9419.100," you know and and"
9420.500,9424.300," often that brought with it some some really"
9425.100,9426.300," significant shift in"
9427.100,9427.300," how they"
9427.700,9428.500," saw the world"
9429.100,9430.000," and their place in it"
9430.700,9431.800," so I've got a little poem here"
9432.900,9435.000," I thought of that little but it's short-ish"
9435.700,9437.400," called frozen Lake"
9438.400,9442.400," and has an epic graph meaning there's a little quote at the start of it"
9442.900,9444.700," which is from a sufi master called"
9445.600,9446.700," shake abuse aid"
9447.600,9450.100," who called himself nobody son of nobody"
9451.000,9452.800," you know sounds like it'd been doing a bit of Zen"
9453.600,9454.700," and he said"
9455.900,9459.100," God says or alarm says the broken ones"
9459.700,9460.400," are my beloved"
9461.900,9464.200," and it's here's the poem The Frozen Lake"
9468.000,9470.600," when I think of Friends who've been through the worst"
9471.500,9472.300," through the dread"
9472.600,9473.000," love"
9473.500,9474.000," lives with"
9474.900,9477.800," through the terrible fear anxiety can only dream"
9479.400,9480.400," of I feel sorry"
9481.500,9482.100," for the rest"
9482.800,9487.600," for those who had it all has that all as who had it all as their hoped"
9488.200,9490.000," who crossed the frozen Lake"
9490.700,9492.200," from one side to the other"
9493.200,9495.000," never guessing the Great"
9495.400,9496.000," Dark"
9496.300,9496.900," beneath"
9498.000,9498.800," but those"
9499.600,9500.100," for whom"
9500.800,9502.000," the frozen Lake"
9502.700,9503.300," cracks"
9503.800,9504.800," and opens"
9505.300,9506.100," who fall"
9506.700,9508.600," into its unspeakable night"
9509.300,9513.100," while walking upright in the light of this world"
9514.900,9515.700," whose hearts"
9516.200,9516.800," burst"
9517.200,9517.900," a any"
9518.400,9519.200," it's Waters"
9520.700,9521.200," for them"
9522.100,9523.000," there is no"
9523.600,9524.300," consolation"
9525.300,9525.900," nor"
9526.200,9526.600," is any"
9527.300,9527.800," needed"
9530.100,9532.100," for them there is no consolation"
9533.100,9534.300," nor is any"
9535.200,9535.600," needed"
9538.400,9538.800," that's it"
9551.500,9552.100," yeah so"
9556.200,9557.100," it seems like"
9560.000,9565.500," yeah there's been a little bit of a theme of heartbreak a little bit is it should always come up actually because"
9566.700,9569.800," I that's one of the key ways that we stop"
9570.900,9572.100," being so cool"
9572.500,9574.500," only by the horizontality"
9574.800,9575.300," of Life of"
9576.700,9577.700," you know trying to get"
9579.100,9579.700," an avoid"
9581.100,9583.300," the things we think we want to get and avoid"
9584.600,9584.600," and"
9585.600,9587.200," some have breaking that pattern"
9587.800,9589.800," let's talk about it yesterday a to b"
9590.400,9594.200," a is me here B is that out there I want to get from here to there"
9600.500,9601.100," practice is"
9604.800,9606.200," is a way of undercutting that"
9608.600,9609.400," what is it to just be"
9610.600,9612.900," to be a and b at the same time"
9620.300,9621.000," okay- let's"
9623.400,9624.300," let's do some movement"
9626.600,9626.800," yeah"
9627.300,9627.800," thank you Luke"
9666.000,9666.600," it"
9668.500,9669.200," sounds good"
9678.800,9680.800," so I'm gonna go movement into"
9681.200,9681.600," seated"
9682.100,9684.000," some breathing and settling cool"
9686.200,9686.300," sorry"
9687.800,9691.500," all right everybody so welcome to standing"
9692.200,9697.400," take a look down at your feet like we've done I want to just play with this um a little bit of toning"
9697.800,9701.000," so see how it feels like what your hands on your hips and just kind of spread your toes out"
9701.500,9705.600," shoes on or off doesn't matter but just feel like you're plugging down into the ground maybe a little bend in your knees"
9706.400,9710.300," and just to sense of toning in your legs your quadriceps maybe your glutes a little bit"
9710.900,9714.000," maybe even your calf muscles if you pushing your big toe Mount you might feel that"
9714.500,9715.200," breathe"
9715.700,9717.500," your hands down by your sides also"
9718.200,9722.200," don't reach down necessarily but do contract from your fingers up your arms"

9891.200,9893.600," and just kind of scan from head to feet"
9894.100,9897.500," like Henry had given us the analogy before of like a coat on a hanger"
9898.700,9901.100," the skeleton is the Hanger the muscles the skin"

9948.100,9948.200," cool"
9948.700,9949.300," and just for"
9950.100,9952.200," 30 seconds or so I go straight up"

9962.900,9965.900," not pointing up but not limp down just right in the center"
9967.100,9969.200," and just feel this space between your arms is um"
9969.700,9971.100," a non-directed"
9971.600,9974.400," chicken kind of standing meditation pose called hugging the tree"
9976.200,9977.100," feel like your feet are"
9977.800,9979.900," plugging down like roots into the tree spreading"
9981.400,9982.000," into the ground"
9983.100,9984.400," just fill all the space between you"
9985.000,9988.800," and just observe where there might be any tension that shows up in your face your shoulders"
9989.600,9992.500," as we do another 15 seconds or so here let breathing be natural"
9993.100,9994.000," but observed"
9994.900,9997.600," and neither be with whatever tension you can observe or"
9998.300,10000.600," note how you can sort of subtly dissolve it"
10001.900,10003.500," so it's it's a one of three different"
10004.100,10007.100," postures so the second we'll be right here like think"
10007.600,10008.700," Clint Eastwood in"
10010.000,10011.100," one of the old western movies"
10011.700,10015.600," you know like guns at the sides micro bending your knees so the only place in your body that"
10016.100,10018.900," might be efforting is like your inner thighs"
10019.500,10021.400," you could feel down into your feet"

10036.100,10036.400," heavy"
10037.100,10037.500," and from your"
10037.900,10039.900," from your neighbor all the way up into your head buoyant"
10041.000,10043.400," another couple seconds here again just observing tension"
10044.100,10047.800," and maybe scanning and dropping tension in your face especially your neck your shoulders"
10049.000,10051.700," and then the last pose right here right in front of the done to the end"
10052.200,10053.200," I was out of the sides"
10053.600,10055.500," same thing just a micro bend in the knees"
10057.700,10061.000," fill the whole field of your appropriate reception like your bubble"
10061.900,10067.800," maybe intersecting and overlapping of others and then just feel your hands a lot of nerves in our hands"
10068.700,10070.600," it's gentle like you're holding space"
10071.300,10072.800," n equally being held by space"
10074.100,10078.400," but your breath touch that space both inside of your body and inside of the bubble"
10079.400,10080.000," around your body"
10082.000,10084.100," very good and then just gently let the hands come down"
10085.000,10086.200," and from the"
10086.700,10090.100," Gravity from the ground simply sweep up soft hands"
10090.800,10091.200," reach Up"
10091.900,10095.700," and once you kind of look up let the hands come down one in front of the other"
10096.400,10098.900," just kind of Passing in front of this three passes"
10099.300,10100.200," we pass through"

10116.300,10116.600," subtle"
10116.900,10117.800," but it can be quite Powerful"
10119.000,10123.200," and then one more time with breath in inhale Softly and smoothly"
10124.700,10127.700," and let the left hand come in front and the right hand come"
10128.000,10128.400," on top"
10129.400,10132.500," almost like you're Gathering space from beyond your field"
10134.100,10134.500," into this"
10135.000,10136.100," space just below your navel"

10146.000,10151.200," down in the gravity up into space feel the heat of your hands so you can fill your breath there"
10153.800,10157.100," just feel this going to the second Dante and the heart space"
10157.900,10158.700," with your right hand"
10165.500,10167.100," and just notice in the presence of your own"

11036.600,11037.200," to all of us"
11037.800,11037.900," yeah"
11038.400,11038.500," okay"
11038.900,11040.600," just just yeah wait for the mic"
11054.100,11055.800," one topic that came up"
11056.400,11058.300," very strongly across all three of us was"
11059.400,11059.600," the"
11060.200,11063.500," the suffering that we feel because of mistakes that we've made in the past"
11064.200,11064.600," errors"
11065.200,11065.300," and"
11065.900,11066.300," how that"
11067.200,11067.700," conflicts"
11068.100,11068.200," with"
11069.000,11069.100," our"
11069.800,11070.500," self-concept"
11071.100,11072.500," we have a self-concept that we are"
11073.100,11075.100," kind or affective or capable or whatever"
11076.000,11077.300," but there's a conflict between"
11078.100,11079.500," that self-concept in the"
11079.900,11080.000," fact that we"
11081.000,11082.100," may previous errors"
11083.000,11084.500," harmed ourselves harm others"
11084.800,11085.300," and so forth"
11086.900,11088.500," and how do we kind of move forward"
11090.700,11093.400," we were I guess we were saying that one of the benefits of meditation for us"
11094.200,11095.000," in all the spells that"
11095.800,11096.400," it helps us to"
11097.000,11098.200," at least stop avoiding"
11098.600,11098.900," some of these"
11099.800,11101.400," facts from our personal history"
11101.900,11103.600," themselves over and over again"
11107.700,11108.800," okay that's great so"
11110.300,11114.700," did everybody get that the benefit of meditation and this case being"
11115.400,11117.400," that it allows us space and time"
11118.400,11119.100," to recognise"
11121.000,11124.000," errors of our ways yeah something like that is that about right"
11124.400,11124.600," yeah"
11125.700,11128.000," that's that's very powerful I mean in fact one of the"
11130.800,11131.800," one of the traditional"
11134.100,11135.500," hindrances so cool"
11136.100,11136.500," of"
11137.100,11139.100," which there are five in early Buddhism"
11140.000,11140.200," is"
11140.900,11144.600," called the full title is restlessness born"
11145.300,11146.000," from worry"
11146.400,11146.700," or"
11147.100,11147.700," regret"
11149.100,11151.500," so you I think you nailed that"
11151.900,11151.900," one"
11152.800,11154.400," or it nailed human yeah"
11154.700,11155.700," more or less and"
11156.200,11160.200," and it's I think it I think I think I fully agree with you I will see the meditation"
11160.900,11168.400," you know it's it's it's it's it's a complex field and it's you can't pin it all down but one of its facets is is like a barometer"
11169.500,11171.900," it sort of tells us kind of how we're doing"
11172.900,11178.800," you know and that can be in the moment and this morning and this day how I'm doing but also like"
11179.400,11179.700," yeah"
11180.600,11184.500," what about my sort of moral inventory or whatever the caller you know is"
11185.600,11186.600," it'll show up more"
11187.100,11189.300," and I I kind of agree with you"
11189.700,11191.000," the personally that's"
11191.600,11194.000," that is actually a really good thing even that can be uncomfortable"
11195.100,11195.700," you know um"
11196.500,11198.900," and it's easier I think one of it again this"
11199.900,11203.900," a to b model I know it's shorter real short hand for"
11205.500,11207.600," being in the world of doing"
11208.000,11210.300," and not reflecting on the being at all"
11211.900,11212.900," I suspect that"
11213.500,11214.000," sometimes"
11214.300,11214.900," it is a"
11215.500,11216.800," it's an unwitting"
11217.800,11220.100," but in some way deliberate distraction"
11220.700,11222.200," from what we would rather not"
11222.400,11222.800," face"
11223.600,11224.500," about ourselves"
11226.500,11229.100," so that's very good thank you for sharing that"
11230.300,11231.400," anything else that"
11232.100,11233.600," a group or a person that I'd like to yeah"
11233.900,11234.200," yes"
11237.500,11238.400," just hold it from a"
11241.500,11243.500," and then let's have a look on line after this"
11245.500,11245.800," thank you"
11248.000,11250.500," yeah please if you wouldn't mind saying your name as well yeah"
11250.900,11251.100," for"
11258.000,11258.400," sure you enjoying"
11259.500,11260.000," the rest of nature"
11261.000,11262.600," meditation and healing their children just"
11263.400,11264.800," small adjustments and"
11266.100,11266.800," tips really have"
11269.100,11272.100," a bit and then I shared with them for me kind of the real"
11273.300,11276.400," switch for me was meditation heard a couple years ago"
11277.500,11278.000," when I"
11278.800,11280.400," originally made it in with"
11280.800,11282.500," think of Sounds outside of"
11283.200,11285.000," distractions or things that I wanted to"
11286.400,11287.100," tamper down"
11288.600,11291.600," there's a garbage truck coming by my house like this is going to terrible session"
11292.200,11294.700," um and then in one meditation session"
11296.500,11299.300," guided session I the person said"
11299.700,11303.300," all of those sounds that's part of your meditation that's that's in here"
11303.800,11304.100," and"
11315.600,11318.800," oh no that's in here oh it's all in here"
11319.200,11321.000," and then I realized oh I can open my eyes"
11321.500,11321.800," and it's still"
11323.200,11324.900," in and I can take this one addition and walk"
11325.700,11326.200," and it's still"
11327.000,11328.000," I can be out in the world"
11333.000,11334.300," beautiful thank you yeah"
11335.000,11335.900," lovely Liz yeah"
11340.800,11341.900," very very nice yeah"
11343.000,11343.900," great okay um"
11345.000,11346.000," let's just see if there's any"
11346.700,11347.600," reflection for that"
11348.500,11353.000," no I don't think it needs fun yeah great excellent no actually I have got a thing"
11353.500,11355.100," I have got to think shins and young"
11355.500,11356.900," some of you might know his work you know"
11357.400,11358.700," he says the 17"
11362.100,11362.800," what is it called them"
11364.600,11365.200," challenges"
11366.000,11366.400," level"
11367.100,11368.100," I can't remember like"
11369.400,11371.800," can we stay meditatively aware"
11372.600,11373.300," when you're sitting"
11373.700,11374.800," easy number one"
11375.100,11378.300," when you're walking slowly number two fine when you"
11379.100,11380.200," preparing a meal"
11381.200,11382.000," when you're cooking"
11383.200,11384.800," when and then it goes up to"
11385.800,11389.700," a sort of egregiously aggressive conversation"
11391.600,11394.000," partner hurling abuse at you"
11394.400,11397.000," suddenly like that can you still stay"
11398.200,11399.900," like it's just a garbage truck you know"
11401.800,11401.900," yeah"
11402.500,11403.100," that's good"
11404.100,11404.300," yeah yeah"
11407.700,11408.800," yeah Online coming"
11410.600,11413.300," the way out has been surprised in the very helpful"
11414.900,11418.400," the only guidance allows for the relaxation I've struggled"
11419.900,11423.100," for many years to cultivate and maintain for any length of time"
11423.800,11426.100," in order to open to my experience"
11427.300,11431.400," the only practice and we offered like a scaffolding up for a while"
11432.200,11433.200," I can get a long look"
11434.000,11434.900," what is already"
11439.000,11439.700," a question"
11440.700,11441.600," but if you do"
11442.100,11443.400," and you elaborate"
11450.300,11451.600," our last I can"
11454.600,11455.400," length"
11458.100,11458.700," what was that"
11461.700,11462.100," oh yeah the"
11462.500,11463.300," the question was"
11463.900,11466.000," what can I elaborate on shame"
11470.000,11470.800," oh boy"
11471.200,11471.400," I mean"
11474.500,11478.200," I mean personally yeah what can I say I mean you know"
11479.000,11483.700," well you know they talk about a different thing guilt and shame guilt is sort of"
11485.000,11485.800," something I did"
11486.800,11489.500," that was bad and shame is I'm bad"
11490.400,11491.700," I'm not worthy"
11493.100,11494.200," I'm not good enough"
11496.900,11497.900," I'm not good enough"
11498.200,11498.800," and you know"
11500.300,11501.600," if we've got that habit"
11503.000,11505.600," and it can be a really ingrained habit"
11507.200,11513.400," I had it really badly actually when I was a young man it really was kind of crippling for a while"
11514.100,11515.800," just about anything that"
11517.200,11518.200," I could think of"
11518.800,11518.900," was"
11519.500,11521.000," I'm another proof"
11521.500,11525.400," you know of my unworthiness and I basically my unlovable"
11525.900,11525.900," this"
11527.400,11527.500," and"
11529.200,11530.200," I think it's probably"
11532.000,11533.200," from what I read"
11534.200,11535.200," kind of an epidemic"
11535.900,11536.700," and in Modern"
11537.600,11538.400," western"
11539.200,11542.600," society is it is that right to say I think it might be yeah"
11543.000,11543.100," yeah"
11544.300,11546.100," right right yeah"
11546.400,11546.700," um"
11547.600,11547.800," and"
11550.600,11554.800," you know I'd like to just jump up and say meditation will help meditation will help"
11555.400,11555.800," meditation"
11557.900,11562.400," is an arena where we can discover a belovedness that is the antidote"
11563.100,11563.600," for shame"
11564.000,11565.200," that we're already loved"
11566.000,11569.500," but you know there's a this there again is a big problem around"
11570.400,11571.600," performance anxiety"
11572.600,11576.400," it's very easy to get into meditation and have it just be another thing"
11577.200,11579.600," that I'm proving my own word in this"
11581.200,11582.800," in another thing I'm messing up"
11583.500,11583.900," so"
11586.800,11588.300," but I hope it wouldn't be that"
11588.700,11591.300," I'm of course at times I've I've known it"
11591.500,11594.300," be that myself and I've seen it in others of course"
11597.100,11598.000," but on the other hand"
11598.700,11602.400," truly when I started meditating the age of 24 or 25"
11606.300,11611.900," I was suffering for a lot of shame and anxiety and depression at the time kind of limping through life very unhappily"
11612.700,11615.200," and it really helped me"
11616.100,11617.100," it just did"
11617.800,11619.100," and I had a I was"
11620.000,11620.800," I wasn't doing"
11622.000,11626.000," you know modern mindfulness which might have helped even more I don't know I was doing"
11626.600,11627.100," TM"
11627.700,11628.900," Johnson doesn't meditation and"
11629.600,11630.600," very strict"
11631.800,11632.300," guidance"
11632.700,11635.600," you had to do it for 20 minutes twice a day"
11636.700,11637.000," which"
11637.300,11640.900," nowadays I would think of as quite a high starting dose"
11641.600,11643.200," you know but it worked for me"
11644.000,11645.900," and you had to do only one thing"
11646.500,11647.400," which is repeat"
11647.800,11649.700," a mantra in your mind"
11649.900,11653.400," for those 20 minutes and obviously you wouldn't do it all the time obviously"
11654.000,11656.100," but you could get chunks of time when you would"
11656.600,11659.000," and then you could do this thing called transcending"
11659.300,11660.000," as they called it"
11660.400,11663.000," which is why it was called transcendental meditation"
11663.500,11664.500," and transcending"
11665.100,11666.500," was a flow state"
11666.900,11669.900," I would now say a samadhi state is a condition where"
11670.400,11672.500," because you've been doing this repeated thing"
11673.300,11674.100," suddenly you"
11675.300,11676.200," you just find your inner"
11676.700,11680.300," it could be quite subtle it could be just a space that's very peaceful"
11681.700,11682.900," marvelously peaceful"
11683.300,11683.500," even"
11684.300,11685.600," oh it could be a place"
11686.600,11688.200," where you know the world"
11689.200,11691.500," is all peaceful around you as well"
11692.400,11693.700," you know those sort of different"
11696.200,11698.600," probably degrees of transcending I don't know I"
11699.100,11700.700," I'm not sure even now that"
11701.100,11704.400," I've always been a bit skeptical about the word transcend"
11704.800,11705.600," transcendence"
11706.600,11707.300," because I don't think"
11708.600,11712.700," insight into the basic nature of self is transcending self"
11713.300,11715.100," I think it's going right into it"
11715.800,11718.800," is the opposite not above it's right in it and it's"
11719.400,11722.200," not transcending the moment it's entering the moment"
11722.600,11724.000," is entering experience"
11724.400,11728.500," from the Inside to become find that you're part of it it's not separate from"
11729.500,11729.800," it but anyway"
11730.800,11731.700," that's a little quibell"
11732.400,11732.700," um"
11735.000,11736.800," and it was"
11738.000,11739.200," in time"
11741.700,11744.800," slow cure for intense shame for me"
11746.100,11747.000," but not without"
11747.900,11752.200," add-ons for help from other sources therapy and stuff you know"
11753.200,11754.000," so I don't know I"
11758.000,11761.300," mean I you know the fundamental position of Zen"
11761.700,11765.000," for example and all non-dual traditions would be the"
11767.100,11767.600," the the"
11769.500,11770.200," one who"
11770.900,11772.500," is a shame of the themselves"
11775.500,11781.200," is actually and I don't think this is a help for somebody suffering a lot of shame but there is actually"
11782.000,11782.600," an invention"
11783.800,11785.300," it is actually an adventure"
11785.900,11786.800," that the self"
11788.600,11789.900," that we think we are"
11791.200,11791.500," is"
11792.000,11792.600," in fact"
11794.800,11795.900," ah fabrication"
11797.500,11800.500," of our minds our minds create the sense of self"
11802.200,11802.300," now"
11802.900,11804.000," it's tricky because"
11807.100,11809.200," each of us is is actually you know"
11810.000,11810.300," who we are"
11811.000,11812.000," our own person"
11812.900,11814.400," and it's one of the Great"
11815.300,11820.700," great invitations of life is to discover more and more sort of who we really are"
11821.300,11824.400," and that can include being the particular person that each of us is and"
11825.000,11825.600," finding what"
11826.100,11829.300," this particular person needs and wants most"
11830.700,11833.100," in order to grow into what they can be and"
11833.500,11837.900," you know James Hillman the psychotherapist has this thing of course the Acorn Theory"
11838.400,11838.900," that we're all"
11839.700,11841.200," a pad within us or are"
11841.700,11844.800," deep inside a little Acorn the wants to grow into an oak tree"
11845.500,11848.200," and it's not that easy for it to grow into an oak tree"
11848.600,11851.500," you have to take little hints from the world and where you get a"
11851.900,11852.000," little"
11852.600,11854.300," infusing at them that might be"
11854.800,11855.300," a sign of"
11855.900,11857.500," this is how this thinking grow and"
11858.000,11859.600," this is what my fertilized it and"
11860.200,11862.300," Dreams can come and give you a little guidance and"
11862.900,11868.000," you know little synchronicities can give you a little guidance all of that stuff sort of Union World kind of thing"
11868.200,11869.000," can help this"
11869.500,11871.900," particular person grow as they need to"
11873.700,11878.100," and that all of that would be some kind of Antidote to shame"
11878.600,11882.800," because all of that is you getting to be you and feeling good about"
11883.100,11883.300," it you know"
11886.900,11887.600," I still think"
11888.700,11890.600," I mean I could write another book called original"
11891.000,11891.500," chain"
11893.800,11896.500," and then there was big almost saying exactly the same stuff"
11897.900,11899.200," we how to find"
11900.200,11902.900," you know what's on the underneath of that shame"
11903.200,11905.600," the beauty the love the preciousness"
11906.400,11907.900," that's on the other side of it you know"
11908.600,11909.600," flip flip it over"
11910.200,11910.900," and it's the opposite"
11911.700,11912.400," you know um"
11913.300,11919.200," and that's partly why I wrote this book is that to help us in these various ways of procures"
11919.600,11921.100," find a kind of belovedness"
11921.400,11922.000," you know that's"
11922.800,11925.000," that's always here that's our birthright I think"
11926.100,11926.300," and"
11927.900,11928.800," I think that's what"
11930.300,11936.000," at their best religions can do you know to help us find that and spiritual practice and it's best and"
11936.200,11937.300," help us find that and"
11937.800,11941.800," and and and and and and and and and all these practices that we're exploring together here"
11942.600,11946.900," should have a hand in helping with that in some some way I think"
11947.800,11950.100," you know and that it we don't have to find"
11950.900,11953.100," as I said earlier we don't have to find"
11954.100,11957.600," the great mind-blowing cosmic Awakening in order to discover that we're beloved"
11958.700,11960.400," it can come in a very small way"
11960.900,11961.800," little tiny"
11962.900,11963.200," hits"
11964.100,11964.900," little tiny"
11965.700,11966.700," micro shift"
11968.000,11968.600," where you know I've been"
11969.500,11971.900," I've been limping along with my anxious heart"
11972.500,11972.800," and then"
11973.800,11974.000," I just"
11974.500,11977.500," look and see a tree on the skyline or I"
11978.200,11981.800," you know I'm just struck by the sound of a bus going by and a new way"
11982.600,11983.100," and just"
11984.300,11984.700," somehow"
11985.700,11985.900," that"
11986.800,11989.200," dread I've been following of anxiety"
11989.900,11991.400," just for a moment it's snapped"
11992.700,11993.500," and I just hear"
11995.000,11996.200," and there isn't a thread"
11996.600,11997.400," of anxiety"
11997.800,11998.100," it's just"
11998.600,11998.700," this"
12000.200,12000.500," and it's"
12001.100,12002.400," it touches my heart"
12003.400,12004.600," and there's a Tenderness"
12006.000,12007.200," that's an antidote to shame"
12008.600,12011.100," I mean you've all seen brenet Brown's talk right"
12012.000,12013.400," vulnerability Ted"
12013.600,12014.300," she called herself"
12017.100,12017.600," you know that"
12018.500,12020.100," if you don't anybody not know that"
12021.400,12023.700," okay it's a famous TED Talk"
12024.300,12024.700," by this"
12025.700,12027.900," psychologist in Texas called brene Brown"
12028.900,12030.100," on vulnerabilities she says"
12032.700,12035.000," the opposite of shame is not pride"
12035.800,12036.900," the opposite of shame"
12037.800,12038.700," is vulnerability"
12040.900,12041.700," I hope I got that right"
12042.300,12046.700," yeah something like that that actually is the vulnerability is the Antidote to shame"
12047.600,12048.200," being okay"
12050.200,12050.500," to be"
12051.200,12051.700," vulnerable"
12055.000,12055.300," okay"
12056.100,12058.700," Luke we've got an is there anything else online by the way while we're"
12059.400,12059.600," okay"
12061.800,12062.100," and then"
12066.200,12067.300," just one more"
12071.500,12071.800," when"
12073.900,12075.500," I wanted to add on to that a little bit or"
12076.300,12076.300," yeah"
12077.600,12080.200," what's the question earlier yesterday and everything else"
12081.400,12083.200," what are the thoughts that kept coming back to was"
12083.800,12083.800," it"
12084.500,12086.400," the things that keep us from allowing"
12087.700,12089.300," awareness to those"
12089.800,12091.500," become more aware of"
12091.700,12092.500," awareness and everything else"
12093.300,12094.300," in shame and everything else"
12094.900,12096.100," that all driven more like ego"
12098.000,12098.000," this"
12098.600,12100.100," is like we're the only ones that can allow ourselves"
12100.900,12100.900," to"
12101.300,12101.300," find"
12102.500,12103.600," vampires of connect"
12104.200,12107.400," and we'll have you through the motor environment or get to let them in right"
12108.400,12108.600," there's always"
12109.400,12109.600," there yeah"
12110.800,12112.400," shame is almost kind of save way right"
12114.200,12114.900," who's shame in"
12118.000,12118.100," it"
12122.700,12127.900," we're the ones that get to three ourselves from that so a lot of times you're like well what's like our"
12128.500,12129.600," our ego is what"
12131.000,12132.700," it's our sense of self and"
12135.200,12137.600," walk through that and around that I guess and that might"
12138.600,12139.700," because we're the medicine right"
12141.200,12141.400," you are"
12141.900,12142.300," just"
12147.300,12149.700," one ingredient really touched on ego"
12150.200,12150.600," it was really"
12153.200,12153.200,"and"
12155.600,12156.100," yeah"
12156.600,12159.100," yeah I'd say that that's a great point there was about"
12159.900,12161.300," what about ego"
12161.600,12163.600," ego being the obstacle"
12163.900,12165.100," or the theme that gets in the way"
12165.900,12168.000," of our finding all the"
12168.900,12172.600," all the good stuff that we can can be open to receiving something like that yeah"
12173.100,12177.300," well I'd let's just just the word I mean that I feel that the word Ego Has"
12178.000,12180.300," at least two meanings one is like"
12181.200,12181.500," kind of"
12182.400,12185.800," the ego is that in me which is egotistical"
12186.200,12186.900," alright it's like"
12187.300,12189.200," it's egoic in the sense of liked"
12190.000,12190.300," you know"
12191.200,12196.700," maybe a bit narcissistic or sort of I'm I'm concerned about me a bubble other than selfish and"
12197.100,12197.900," looking up myself"
12199.000,12201.700," and then it can also mean just the sense of self"
12203.700,12205.300," I think in freud's"
12207.400,12216.900," I don't want to get too technical and my I might be wrong but as far as I remember Freud use the sense and ego he brought it in I think as a terminology"
12217.500,12221.000," Ed ego and super ego three parts he thought they were"
12221.500,12222.800," and the the ego I think"
12223.100,12225.300," for him was kind of the normal sense of self"
12225.800,12227.700," they would which didn't necessarily have"
12229.000,12230.600," the the later"
12231.200,12234.200," complexion of being like selfish like"
12234.800,12237.200," this is this is ego driven would be"
12238.200,12241.700," a negative thing to say of something right whereas I think it could be just neutral"
12241.900,12242.600," sense of self"
12243.100,12243.200," so"
12245.500,12246.500," that being said"
12248.600,12251.800," in a certain way I think it is what I've been talking about"
12252.000,12253.000," just didn't use the word"
12256.000,12256.400," I think"
12258.300,12262.400," I have to reflect on that bit but I think so the sense of self"
12264.000,12265.700," interchangeably use with ego"
12269.200,12271.900," however there's also is the"
12272.800,12276.100," is there something about like a self-defensive"
12278.100,12280.200," a self-protective self"
12280.600,12281.400," promotional"
12282.800,12283.000," side the"
12283.400,12283.900," creeps in"
12284.600,12285.800," and that doesn't want"
12286.400,12287.900," to let in"
12289.100,12289.600," the world"
12290.700,12291.800," doesn't want to let in"
12293.200,12296.500," the wider awareness that it wants to be in charge"
12297.600,12297.800," yeah"
12298.200,12300.000," and I think that's that's right there is"
12301.100,12303.000," it's afraid of"
12303.800,12305.100," basically not having control"
12306.000,12306.600," you know and"
12307.800,12308.800," and the path of"
12310.400,12312.100," everything we've been doing really"
12312.900,12316.600," requires a slackening of control"
12317.900,12320.100," a slackening of the reins you know"
12321.200,12323.400," a kind a little bit of surrender"
12324.300,12325.200," and yielding"
12329.800,12330.100," yeah"
12330.500,12332.500," okay let's get the mic one more yeah"
12333.300,12333.500," yeah"
12335.100,12335.400," oh yeah"
12336.100,12336.300," okay"
12338.800,12339.500," just a moment"
12339.600,12339.700," yeah"
12340.800,12342.200," Adam"
12343.600,12344.900," a question from his wife"
12347.000,12350.700," I'm your experiences a teacher we say that there is any difference"
12351.400,12354.200," in meditation advice for men vs women at all"
12354.900,12356.800," or is that perhaps some theme"
12357.300,12358.600," that comes up more often"
12359.200,12360.800," with women vs men"
12364.700,12365.300," yeah that's"
12365.900,12367.100," oh"
12371.100,12371.600," yeah"
12372.500,12374.700," yeah thank you"
12377.700,12380.300," yeah I think that's the right answer yeah"
12382.300,12383.100," yes and"
12384.800,12385.700," okay next question"
12399.500,12399.600," yeah"
12400.000,12400.500," we think"
12401.100,12403.500," in your meeting more and Bam you go"
12404.000,12404.300," right there"
12405.400,12405.600," really"
12406.500,12407.100," is"
12408.600,12409.500," me"
12410.300,12411.700," and then about age 5 it's"
12413.300,12413.700," which I"
12414.400,12414.700," want me"
12416.400,12418.500," to so if there is a shameful environment"
12420.200,12421.400," yeah that Venus"
12422.300,12423.100," I am the center"
12424.800,12424.800," has"
12425.400,12425.800," to be"
12426.800,12430.800," hitting because of me all right and then when you switch"
12434.600,12435.300," rationalizes"
12437.700,12438.400,"and you"
12439.000,12439.000," have to"
12441.700,12442.500," nervous"
12443.100,12443.300," yeah"
12444.000,12444.000," you"
12445.400,12445.500," alright"
12445.900,12447.400," thank you thank you great"
12448.600,12450.400," that's a great perspective yeah"
12450.800,12453.600," okay now I think we'll pause there actually"
12454.300,12454.400," because"
12456.100,12458.400," I want us to have another"
12459.300,12460.100," quiet time"
12460.900,12464.500," together because they're so precious I think to be able to just sit quietly"
12465.200,12466.100," in the same room"
12466.800,12467.700," IRL"
12468.500,12472.800," when we don't get to do that so often so"
12473.700,12476.400," so let's let's yeah let's assume the position"
12478.900,12479.400," one more time"
12502.000,12503.800," so without any Bell"
12504.100,12505.700," to demarcate"
12507.600,12508.500," in any way"
12510.300,12511.900," beginning or end of meditation"
12514.800,12515.600," can you just"
12519.000,12519.500," notice"
12523.300,12524.200," the great Ocean"
12528.700,12530.800," great ocean of presence"
12536.400,12537.500," it's very simple"
12539.200,12541.500," is really just what's here"
12560.800,12563.200," if it's here for you slip into it"
12564.200,12565.900," as into a warm sea"
12569.900,12572.500," if it's not so clearly present"
12574.900,12575.800," just be still"
12579.700,12581.500," and let it come by itself"
12596.500,12598.100," no need to try to find"
13069.600,13070.500,"okay so"
13071.800,13072.900," yeah it's gently"
13073.900,13075.500," bringing movement back into the body"
13076.900,13077.800," raising the eyes"
13078.400,13079.000," and"
